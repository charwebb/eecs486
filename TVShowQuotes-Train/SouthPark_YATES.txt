Oh my God. Murphy!  You're not gonna believe this.

Yeah, teach me a lesson, daddy!

Tom Johansen, the owner of the ice cream shop!

Oh yeah, yeah, get those pants down.

None of it makes sense anymore.  I don't even know if what we're doing is right. The last thirteen hours we've been working on a case, trying to get a real scumbag off the streets. And when he walked up to the door, I could have sworn he was white. Maybe I can't tell the difference anymore. Maybe it doesn't matter. Because it seems like every time we frame a rich black guy, he's back out on the streets in no time. It's just like OJ. Do you know how hard those cops worked to frame him? The tireless hours they put in?! And then he just gets off because somebody messed up and said the N word out loud too many times. I guess I'm just tired. I'm just damn tired.

Which can only mean one thing!

Oh? What's the crime?

Yeah, you really worked it, Daddy. You really gave my little hole quite a...  STRETCH.

You say he disappeared? What did you frame him for?

Nnice.

I'm not sure. I'm gonna have to run some tests. 

Jesus Christ!

Twenty for oral, fifty for half and half, anal will cost you extra.

Freeze!  You are under arrest for soliciting prostitution! Book him, boys! 

I know it's ridiculous,  but I'm gonna explore every possibility I can!  Hello, young man, could we have a quick word with you?

Oh, you're a nasty little fuck, aren't you? Yeah, let me see that hot penis of yours. Oh yeah, nice. Yeah, I'm ready when you are.

Yeah... Amazing coincidence...

You're kidding!

Hey Har- Har- Harris! Harris!

Be right there. Sorry guys, my daddy needs me right now. 

Does that look like a black guy to you?!

It's Jefferson! He's back!  All right, people. Let's give Blacky a nice welcome home.  Whoa, wait a minute!  That guy isn't black!  Holy God, his son isn't black either! Oh Jesus!  This is Yates! Stand down! I repeat, stand down! Suspect is not black!  You son of a bitch, you told my this guy was African-American!

All right, buddy!... Go ahead and unbutton your pants.  All right! Here we go. 

Right here's good, sexy.  Now if you wouldn't mind handing over the twenty dollars for oral sex.

Get him!  Code 6! Code 6!

Young man, the doctor said you've had some... visions about our newest murder?

Damnit, where were all these sexed-up teachers when I was a kid?!

Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! We could have made an innocent man go to jail who wasn't black! Oh!  Wuuugh! Wuugh! Ohaugh. Ugh.  Jesus, Harris. What are we becoming? We're supposed to... protect the people. Where have we lost our way?

Babe, I love you too.

It must be true. The kid is psychic.  But I don't suppose it really matters much. Because in the end, the way I caught the killer was with... good old-fashioned police work. Come on, Murphy. 

There he is! Hey, Eric! Eric!  We've got a little problem.

Well, that explains it.

Hey baby, you looking for a party?

I'm givin' up, Maggie. I'm quitting the force. 

So then we need to go after the johns. We need to let the men of this town know that if they paid for sex they're going to jail!

Oh my God! This is terrible!  Ya-you did the right thing telling the police, Brad. Now, who is the teacher? What's his name?

Johnson, what about you?

I see you like cutting the eyes out of photos of women. My son is a big fan of that, too.

Jesus H.... That boy was right! Arrest that guy!  Whoa-whoa-wait-wait-hey-wait-wait-yo! Oh, wait a minute, no ah, I'm wrong.

Freeze, Jefferson! The gig is up! You are wanted for child mo-les-tation!

Nope, this isn't our man.  We're sorry, Mr. God. It appears we've wasted your time. 

Yeah, you're a dirty fuck!

No way! Let's just get to this, baby.

The blonde?

Hold it right there, killer! 

Well, Mr. God, it won't take but a second; it might help us with an investigation. 

So, you are agreeing to have sex with me for one hundred dollars, correct?

Good evening, sir. We're Park County detectives. We were just wondering if we could take a quick look around your house, Misterrr...

This is a sting operation, scumbag, and you're going to jail for soliciting prostitution.  Got our first one, boys. I'm bringing him in for booking.

Are you sure you're not lying, Foley?

It's too late for that, Keshawn! I just told this pimp I was his bitch now.

So wait, what, what's the crime?

Yeah, you like it?

Let's, uh, let's just be happy okay?

By God, so he is. Black and rich. Time to take this Mr. Jefferson down, just like we did Kobe.  Let's go people!  We've got another rich black guy. I want him humiliated and dragged through the dirt, and I want it done by the books!

Frakes?

Well, if you're gonna give away all your money, then, I guess we can drop all those charges. No point in putting another poor black man in jail.

Give it to me! Come on, you sissies, I can fit more of ya!  Yeah, you like your little stripper whore?! You like her?! FREEZE!  Take them all to the station, for oral and anal sex with a prostitute! Half of them didn't even use a condom!  Don't you stupid kids know the diseases you can catch?! Hand me that evidence bag. 

Sorry we had to do this, but the lady principal insisted. 

Teach this little whore a lesson!

That a copycat killer is on the loose! We need your psychic abilities to catch this new guy right away!

Whatcha got?

A wife and kids. And you're out here trollin' the streets for prostitutes. You make me sick! Take him downtown, boys. I'm goin' back on the street.

Young man, how did you know the nurse was gonna walk in just now?

Stand back, give him room!  Come on, kid, concentrate! What do you see in your mind?

I've... heard cases where people suffering head trauma awaken to some psychic abilities.

Well those aren't left hands.  See, on your left hand, the thumb faces to the left. Those are all right hands.

You've got a lot of nerve coming here, Keshawn! After the way you treated me? I need a pimp that doesn't beat me every time he gets drunk!

Little boy...  Well it's a snowball's chance in hell but...  we were wondering if you could come down and see if your... new powers could help us catch the killer.

Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! It must be the same guy!

Congratulations, Eric. You just stopped the biggest killer in South Park history.

Let's go! 

Why is it that us policemen around the country have such a passion for framing wealthy African-Americans with crimes they didn't commit?

What do you think, Mitch?

All right, when this Jefferson guy shows up, arrest him fast and try not to beat him. There could be neighbors with video cameras.  Why do we do it, Harris?

Oh Keshawn! 

Mr. Johansen, could we have a quick word with you?

What?!  Hohoo, not in my county!

Damnit! Another murder victim! For three years the Left-Hand killer has been at large and I've exhausted every lead! Maybe... I just don't have what it takes to be a cop anymore.

All right, we'll check this Deets guy out. But let's use that one thing that we never use.

Oh right! The hands! Right! 

What?! No way! Nothing is more important than keeping prostitution out of our community!  Oh, hold on, that's my daddy.  Hey Daddy.

That's damn fine police work, sergeant. Damn fine.

Call it police intuition, but somethin' in there just didn't feel right.  Wait a minute.

To hell with you! I'm never gonna frame an innocent man again! Unless I know he's black for sure!

We need an undercover cop disguised as a prostitute, so we can arrest any citizens looking for cheap thrills!

So, what's the problem?

Well, he doesn't really look that black.

Twenty-five years I've been on the force. I've seen every kind of sick, depraved act known to humanity and still, when I see a black man walk by who has more money than me, I... want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter. But why? Maybe there is no reason. Maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride.

His powers are uncanny. Take good care of him, Ms. Cartman. Make sure he uses his powers... for good.

Dammit! Dammit all to hell! They just found another body! That means a fifth copycat killer is on the loose! Where's my psychic?!

Molestation, nice.

Jesus Christ! Cause of death?

Yeah, come on! Harder! Deeper!

Ye-yes, Daddy, I'm on my way.

While the ice-cream store owner was in jail, another murder was committed.

All right all right, we'll make a report. Jesus...

All right, let's go, Murphy. Hang on a second, where are, where are my car keys?

Well hold on. I've got something for you too, my love. I just put it right over here by the...  FREEZE!! Ha! You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!

Murphy, you inside?

Yeah, yeah, restraint. We'll check this guy out, but let's use some restraint. 

Who are we gonna convict? Johnny Walker?

Think I've got a little more work to do. 

Yeah, that's right!

Oh that's all right.  Nothing wrong with a-FREEZE!  You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!

Well, we've been trying to frame this guy who just moved into our town, and the fil-o-fax says he moved from your area. One Martin Jefferson?

Well, I think that's about all I need to hear.

And you're a good wife, Maggie. You know me better than I know myself.
