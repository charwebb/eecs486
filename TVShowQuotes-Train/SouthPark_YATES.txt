Young man, how did you know the nurse was gonna walk in just now?
Well, I think that's about all I need to hear.
Good evening, sir. We're Park County detectives. We were just wondering if we could take a quick look around your house, Misterrr...
Doctor, didn't you say that kid suffered head trauma?
Damnit, where were all these sexed-up teachers when I was a kid?!
To hell with you! I'm never gonna frame an innocent man again! Unless I know he's black for sure!
So you're telling me somebody new is now copying the crimes of the copycat killer?! Jesus! Where will it end?!  Every time I put a killer behind bars, another guy just steps in and takes his place! What am I doing wrong?!
Right here's good, sexy.  Now if you wouldn't mind handing over the twenty dollars for oral sex.
All right, when this Jefferson guy shows up, arrest him fast and try not to beat him. There could be neighbors with video cameras.  Why do we do it, Harris?
Be right there. Sorry guys, my daddy needs me right now. 
You say he disappeared? What did you frame him for?
Twenty for oral, fifty for half and half, anal will cost you extra.
Well, we've been trying to frame this guy who just moved into our town, and the fil-o-fax says he moved from your area. One Martin Jefferson?
Yeah, you really worked it, Daddy. You really gave my little hole quite a...  STRETCH.
Oh, you're a nasty little fuck, aren't you? Yeah, let me see that hot penis of yours. Oh yeah, nice. Yeah, I'm ready when you are.
Well those aren't left hands.  See, on your left hand, the thumb faces to the left. Those are all right hands.
It's Jefferson! He's back!  All right, people. Let's give Blacky a nice welcome home.  Whoa, wait a minute!  That guy isn't black!  Holy God, his son isn't black either! Oh Jesus!  This is Yates! Stand down! I repeat, stand down! Suspect is not black!  You son of a bitch, you told my this guy was African-American!
Dammit! Dammit all to hell! They just found another body! That means a fifth copycat killer is on the loose! Where's my psychic?!
Sorry we had to do this, but the lady principal insisted. 
Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! We could have made an innocent man go to jail who wasn't black! Oh!  Wuuugh! Wuugh! Ohaugh. Ugh.  Jesus, Harris. What are we becoming? We're supposed to... protect the people. Where have we lost our way?
Does that look like a black guy to you?!
All right, we'll check this Deets guy out. But let's use that one thing that we never use.
Little boy...  Well it's a snowball's chance in hell but...  we were wondering if you could come down and see if your... new powers could help us catch the killer.
Well hold on. I've got something for you too, my love. I just put it right over here by the...  FREEZE!! Ha! You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!
Oh that's all right.  Nothing wrong with a-FREEZE!  You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!
It must be true. The kid is psychic.  But I don't suppose it really matters much. Because in the end, the way I caught the killer was with... good old-fashioned police work. Come on, Murphy. 
That a copycat killer is on the loose! We need your psychic abilities to catch this new guy right away!
So, you are agreeing to have sex with me for one hundred dollars, correct?
We need an undercover cop disguised as a prostitute, so we can arrest any citizens looking for cheap thrills!
All right, let's go, Murphy. Hang on a second, where are, where are my car keys?
His powers are uncanny. Take good care of him, Ms. Cartman. Make sure he uses his powers... for good.
Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! It must be the same guy!
While the ice-cream store owner was in jail, another murder was committed.
I've... heard cases where people suffering head trauma awaken to some psychic abilities.
Damnit! Another murder victim! For three years the Left-Hand killer has been at large and I've exhausted every lead! Maybe... I just don't have what it takes to be a cop anymore.
You know, what's that one thing that starts with an R that we never use?
Well, if you're gonna give away all your money, then, I guess we can drop all those charges. No point in putting another poor black man in jail.
That's damn fine police work, sergeant. Damn fine.
All right, buddy!... Go ahead and unbutton your pants.  All right! Here we go. 
It's too late for that, Keshawn! I just told this pimp I was his bitch now.
By God, so he is. Black and rich. Time to take this Mr. Jefferson down, just like we did Kobe.  Let's go people!  We've got another rich black guy. I want him humiliated and dragged through the dirt, and I want it done by the books!
Why is it that us policemen around the country have such a passion for framing wealthy African-Americans with crimes they didn't commit?
So then we need to go after the johns. We need to let the men of this town know that if they paid for sex they're going to jail!
You're right. We're sorry. This is serious. We need to track this student down and... give him his "Luckiest Boy In America" medal right away. 
I'm not sure. I'm gonna have to run some tests. 
Nope, this isn't our man.  We're sorry, Mr. God. It appears we've wasted your time. 
Oh my God. Murphy!  You're not gonna believe this.
There he is! Hey, Eric! Eric!  We've got a little problem.
Congratulations, Eric. You just stopped the biggest killer in South Park history.
Tom Johansen, the owner of the ice cream shop!
Call it police intuition, but somethin' in there just didn't feel right.  Wait a minute.
You've got a lot of nerve coming here, Keshawn! After the way you treated me? I need a pimp that doesn't beat me every time he gets drunk!
Hello, this is Sergeant Yates over at the Park County Police Department in Colorado.
A wife and kids. And you're out here trollin' the streets for prostitutes. You make me sick! Take him downtown, boys. I'm goin' back on the street.
This isn't the guy. The serial killer always cuts off the victims' left hands.
I see you like cutting the eyes out of photos of women. My son is a big fan of that, too.
Twenty-five years I've been on the force. I've seen every kind of sick, depraved act known to humanity and still, when I see a black man walk by who has more money than me, I... want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter. But why? Maybe there is no reason. Maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride.
Oh my God! This is terrible!  Ya-you did the right thing telling the police, Brad. Now, who is the teacher? What's his name?
All right all right, we'll make a report. Jesus...
Excuse me!  Well well well, this must be the organization I've been hearing so much about. Took me a long time to find you. You won't believe the hardships I've been through trying to track you down. My name is Yolanda. I'd like to know all about your operation here. You see I just left my pimp recently and I'm looking for a new one?
I know it's ridiculous,  but I'm gonna explore every possibility I can!  Hello, young man, could we have a quick word with you?
Stand back, give him room!  Come on, kid, concentrate! What do you see in your mind?
None of it makes sense anymore.  I don't even know if what we're doing is right. The last thirteen hours we've been working on a case, trying to get a real scumbag off the streets. And when he walked up to the door, I could have sworn he was white. Maybe I can't tell the difference anymore. Maybe it doesn't matter. Because it seems like every time we frame a rich black guy, he's back out on the streets in no time. It's just like OJ. Do you know how hard those cops worked to frame him? The tireless hours they put in?! And then he just gets off because somebody messed up and said the N word out loud too many times. I guess I'm just tired. I'm just damn tired.
And you're a good wife, Maggie. You know me better than I know myself. 
Well, Mr. God, it won't take but a second; it might help us with an investigation. 
What?! No way! Nothing is more important than keeping prostitution out of our community!  Oh, hold on, that's my daddy.  Hey Daddy.
Freeze!  You are under arrest for soliciting prostitution! Book him, boys! 
Murphy, do you remember what I was supposed to be doing?
Give it to me! Come on, you sissies, I can fit more of ya!  Yeah, you like your little stripper whore?! You like her?! FREEZE!  Take them all to the station, for oral and anal sex with a prostitute! Half of them didn't even use a condom!  Don't you stupid kids know the diseases you can catch?! Hand me that evidence bag. 
Well young man, you did an amazing thing. Not only did your psychic visions help us catch the killer, but a lot of innocent people are out of jail.
This is... where the body was found.  Multiple stab wounds, just like all the others.
Mr. Johansen, could we have a quick word with you?
Think I've got a little more work to do.
