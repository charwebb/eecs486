This is! Oh boy, I always do this.
Have you ever heard of asking? (door bell rings) Who is it?
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.
Ya wanna catch a ballgame this weekend?
Hi.
(smiles, relieved) Hold on.
Sure. (strolls away with his friends)
Y'think?
Read!
Not at all.
Yeah! I think I like short hair. Really short.
(drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door) Hold on. (unlocks and opens door) Hey.
Yeah!
(eyes closed in hug) Oh. Me so happy. Me want to cry.
What was that?
Hey! Elaine! Hi-i! Over here!
Okay. (to self, smiling) Vargus.. (to FELDMAN) So?
Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it.
(Here ya are.)
(unlocks, opens door) Hi Elaine! (warmly hugs her)
(grabs it) No. You got it last time.
Oh, so what did you do?
(friendly) Just reading..
Oh, yeah. Like last summer. I'm watchin' TV and I saw one of those jet-skis. $4000 later and it's sitting in my garage.
I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying.
No, no, I think I agree with you. I mean, all this talk about having babies.
(enthused) Fourth row, center.
Hey.. What're you doing?
(getting up) Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. (the three guys are leaving)
Come on in!
Friends?
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"
I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it.
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!
Sometimes I think I do want kids. Maybe a lot of kids!
Elaine, you've changed my life.
Nice. (doorbell rings) Who is it?
All right! Hey, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!
I got a vasectomy this morning.
Besides, anyone can do it.
