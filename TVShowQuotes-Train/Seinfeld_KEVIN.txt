(unlocks, opens door) Hi Elaine! (warmly hugs her)
This is! Oh boy, I always do this.
Have you ever heard of asking? (door bell rings) Who is it?
(drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door) Hold on. (unlocks and opens door) Hey.
Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it.
(grabs it) No. You got it last time.
Oh, yeah. Like last summer. I'm watchin' TV and I saw one of those jet-skis. $4000 later and it's sitting in my garage.
I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying.
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!
(getting up) Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. (the three guys are leaving)
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!
All right! Hey, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!
I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it.
Yeah! I think I like short hair. Really short.
Okay. (to self, smiling) Vargus.. (to FELDMAN) So?
(eyes closed in hug) Oh. Me so happy. Me want to cry.
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.
