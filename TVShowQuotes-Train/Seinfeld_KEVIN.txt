Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it.
Okay. (to self, smiling) Vargus.. (to FELDMAN) So?
Oh, yeah. Like last summer. I'm watchin' TV and I saw one of those jet-skis. $4000 later and it's sitting in my garage.
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!
(grabs it) No. You got it last time.
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.
Sometimes I think I do want kids. Maybe a lot of kids!
No, no, I think I agree with you. I mean, all this talk about having babies.
Yeah! I think I like short hair. Really short.
Have you ever heard of asking? (door bell rings) Who is it?
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.
I got a vasectomy this morning.
Come on in!
Who is it?
This is! Oh boy, I always do this.
(smiles, relieved) Hold on.
Besides, anyone can do it.
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"
Sure. (strolls away with his friends)
Hey! Elaine! Hi-i! Over here!
Friends?
What was that?
(friendly) Just reading..
Elaine, you've changed my life.
All right! Hey, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!
Hey.. What're you doing?
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!
(testy) Hello, Vargus..
(unlocks, opens door) Hi Elaine! (warmly hugs her)
Y'think?
(drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door) Hold on. (unlocks and opens door) Hey.
(eyes closed in hug) Oh. Me so happy. Me want to cry.
(getting up) Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. (the three guys are leaving)
Nice. (doorbell rings) Who is it?
Yeah!
Not at all.
I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it.
(enthused) Fourth row, center.
I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying.
(Here ya are.)
