(Here ya are.)
(enthused) Fourth row, center.
Elaine, you've changed my life.
Nice. (doorbell rings) Who is it?
Y'think?
(smiles, relieved) Hold on.
Sure. (strolls away with his friends)
All right! Hey, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!
Have you ever heard of asking? (door bell rings) Who is it?
Hey! Elaine! Hi-i! Over here!
What was that?
This is! Oh boy, I always do this.
Okay. (to self, smiling) Vargus.. (to FELDMAN) So?
Come on in!
Besides, anyone can do it.
Yeah!
Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it.
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"
(drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door) Hold on. (unlocks and opens door) Hey.
(unlocks, opens door) Hi Elaine! (warmly hugs her)
(eyes closed in hug) Oh. Me so happy. Me want to cry.
Read!
(grabs it) No. You got it last time.
No, no, I think I agree with you. I mean, all this talk about having babies.
Sometimes I think I do want kids. Maybe a lot of kids!
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.
I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it.
Not at all.
I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying.
Friends?
(getting up) Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. (the three guys are leaving)
Yeah! I think I like short hair. Really short.
(friendly) Just reading..
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!
Hey.. What're you doing?
(testy) Hello, Vargus..
I got a vasectomy this morning.
Oh, so what did you do?
Who is it?
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!
