This is! Oh boy, I always do this.
Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it.
(getting up) Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. (the three guys are leaving)
(eyes closed in hug) Oh. Me so happy. Me want to cry.
(drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door) Hold on. (unlocks and opens door) Hey.
I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it.
I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying.
No, no, I think I agree with you. I mean, all this talk about having babies.
(unlocks, opens door) Hi Elaine! (warmly hugs her)
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!
Oh, yeah. Like last summer. I'm watchin' TV and I saw one of those jet-skis. $4000 later and it's sitting in my garage.
Yeah! I think I like short hair. Really short.
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.
All right! Hey, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!
(grabs it) No. You got it last time.
Sometimes I think I do want kids. Maybe a lot of kids!
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"
Okay. (to self, smiling) Vargus.. (to FELDMAN) So?
