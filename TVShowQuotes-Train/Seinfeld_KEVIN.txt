I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it.
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.
Friends?
(testy) Hello, Vargus..
(Here ya are.)
Y'think?
Oh, yeah. Like last summer. I'm watchin' TV and I saw one of those jet-skis. $4000 later and it's sitting in my garage.
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.
Sometimes I think I do want kids. Maybe a lot of kids!
All right! Hey, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!
(friendly) Just reading..
Come on in!
Yeah!
This is! Oh boy, I always do this.
(smiles, relieved) Hold on.
Hi.
I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying.
Ya wanna catch a ballgame this weekend?
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"
Elaine, you've changed my life.
Okay. (to self, smiling) Vargus.. (to FELDMAN) So?
(getting up) Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. (the three guys are leaving)
(grabs it) No. You got it last time.
Hey! Elaine! Hi-i! Over here!
Yeah! I think I like short hair. Really short.
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!
Who is it?
Hey.. What're you doing?
I got a vasectomy this morning.
(eyes closed in hug) Oh. Me so happy. Me want to cry.
Have you ever heard of asking? (door bell rings) Who is it?
(drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door) Hold on. (unlocks and opens door) Hey.
Not at all.
(enthused) Fourth row, center.
Besides, anyone can do it.
Nice. (doorbell rings) Who is it?
Sure. (strolls away with his friends)
Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it.
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!
