Well, I should think the most logical solution would be... hormones.
Yes. I have been a member for several years. I'm sure they'd let you join. You l-look about right.
I've done it, Kevin. I've successfully spliced this chipmunk with a piece of provolone cheese.  Do you know what this means, Kevin? No more will the world have to look in two different places for squirrels and provolone cheese. No more will mankind have to pick-  Who could that be?  Why, it's little Eric Cartman.
What's going on? You got what you wanted, gingers, so let us go.
Oh, Eric, I'm afraid it's not that simple. Genetic engineering has not yet evolved to the state where I can just make people.
Yes, puberty is a very wonderful thing, Stan. It's what links us all together, makes us one.
Yes!  Here, and tell your father to take just one of these pills every week. It could be just what he needs. And be sure to tell him that his secret is safe with me.
Oh for crying out loud, now everyone is letting themselves in! 
Never went through puberty? Who never went through puberty?
Oh I'm... terribly sorry, but I don't let strangers in.
No wait, I'm sorry, you're right you're right, we do have a black president. Please, come in. 
Oh, I can't say that I blame him.
Yeah, right, let me guess: You're an African-American.
There's a gas station about half a mile down the road. They have a phone there.
Oh. Well, I happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. It's called, NAMBLA.
It's a complicated story. I just can't tell him quickly.
Eric, your father never wanted this to happen. He was protecting you as well as them.
Eric, you have to understand, it's all very complicated.
