You'll do nothing of the kind! This ship is now property of the United States Government!
Look, we don't know what that craft is capable of, but the kid is going to have to land it somewhere. God only knows what sadistic backwards Third-World country could get their hands on that ship!
Boys, we need to talk to you about a matter of national security. Now!
Alright, children, we just need to know one thing: Do you know this person? 
Oh, that won't be a problem, Ms. Struthers. We have... collateral. 
Ms. Struthers, we understand that you have a ship of your own. One capable of interstellar travel.
I want everyone to keep a safe distance from the craft until we can run some tests.
Let's go through this one more time, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk! Your son Marvin has the ship that we want! How can we get it from him? 
Good! Now get them in our tractor beam! 
We need information on one of the Ethiopians. You must tell us everything you know about him. 
Why, yes. It is a chocolate Yum Yum bar, Ms. Struthers , and there are several more where that came from.  Of course, if you don't want to tell us about the Ethiopian boy...
Alright boys. Time to get back to your quarters.
I know exactly where Sall Struthers is. Let them go.
Look, kid. Did you really think this was going to fool anybody? You don't look anything like Tom Brokaw.
This is getting us nowhere. We'll have to resort to more drastic measures.
We're with the American government! Sally Struthers told us where we'd find Marvin's parents!
Approximately 31 hours ago, an ethnic-looking child was spotted flying some kind of state-of-the-art space craft over Chinese air space.
Ms. Struthers. We understand you have helped raise millions of dollars to help starving children in Ethiopia.
