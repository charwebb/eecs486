You'll do nothing of the kind! This ship is now property of the United States Government!
Ms. Struthers. We understand you have helped raise millions of dollars to help starving children in Ethiopia.
Alright boys. Time to get back to your quarters.
Boys, we need to talk to you about a matter of national security. Now!
This is getting us nowhere. We'll have to resort to more drastic measures.
Why, yes. It is a chocolate Yum Yum bar, Ms. Struthers , and there are several more where that came from.  Of course, if you don't want to tell us about the Ethiopian boy...
I'm warning you, Bill. Sally Struthers is a bit heavy. But don't say anything, because she's pretty sensitive.
I know exactly where Sall Struthers is. Let them go.
Alright, children, we just need to know one thing: Do you know this person? 
Ms. Struthers, we understand that you have a ship of your own. One capable of interstellar travel.
Good! Now get them in our tractor beam! 
I want everyone to keep a safe distance from the craft until we can run some tests.
Approximately 31 hours ago, an ethnic-looking child was spotted flying some kind of state-of-the-art space craft over Chinese air space.
We're with the American government! Sally Struthers told us where we'd find Marvin's parents!
Look, kid. Did you really think this was going to fool anybody? You don't look anything like Tom Brokaw.
Oh, that won't be a problem, Ms. Struthers. We have... collateral. 
We need information on one of the Ethiopians. You must tell us everything you know about him. 
Let's go through this one more time, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk! Your son Marvin has the ship that we want! How can we get it from him?
