All right sweetie, I'll tell her its Michael.
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus!
Do you think they'll get the account. [Stanley stares at her] How come you never answer me?
Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it?
The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing.
Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?
And if the food stations are here and here... no!  Here and here.  Drinks here, then people can mingle.  But then where would the band go?
I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.
You mean the clients you stole from us.
I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that...
If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?
He's a real catch and you should take him back.
[Takes here gift out of her bowl] Oh. What are these?
It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson���s a mean old grump. [laughs] But [crying] would a grump make this? It���s me. It���s me.
You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...
Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can���t just press a magic button.
[on the phone] You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one.
[crying] Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn't supposed to take no for an answer.
Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.
You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.
So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you -
The three of us have all been chairmen before.
You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it.
Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts. [Michael stares at her incredulously] But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads.
And when you fell in, did you flounder?
I���m happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
I don't know, I'm not used to the stress.
Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X?
Jim, don't listen to Andy.  I think it's so romantic.
Oh, I���m gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.
You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder.
Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested.
I couldn't see your hands. [Jim shakes his hands] Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK?
[to Stanley] Hey! Good to have you back.
Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far.
That's a shame.  Ed was a good guy.
I don't think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
Michael. [Michael throws Phyllis' keys under the car.]
Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... it's stupid, forget it.
It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning!
So, uh, show us how you���d normally sell to a female client.
Goodnight Pam. [Leaves with oversized bear on back.]
This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood!
Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.
Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.
My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you?
20 cartons of it's coming, on it's way.
This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee.  The theme is 'Nights in Morocco'.  This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party.  Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate.
Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay.  Everything else goes in the drawer.
This is ridiculous.  We just can't wait here.
Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.
During our honeymoon safari in Africa, Bob and I were driving late at night, and he'd been drinking, and suddenly thump.  We hit something with our jeep.  It was probably a man.  We didn't know what to do.  We heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us, so we just kept driving as fast as we could.  We bribed the airline, got on a plane that night, and fled home.  Maybe it was just an ostrich.  In a soccer uniform.
An Xbox it is. Because I've decided you're a good boy.
I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it. [she awkwardly hugs Jim] It's been a long journey... but [sniffles] I'm Santa Claus!
Dwight was in the ladies' room and he was looking at me.
If my daughter were asking me... [both giggle]
It's not gonna get better; he's gonna steal all of our clients.
I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works.
The first thing I'd buy is new boobs. For my mom. She has the worst boobs. It- It's embarrassing.
And I imagine things are starting to heat up?
It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was.
What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.
Ooh. Isn't that the one where the guy becomes limitless?
Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.
Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me?  We'll take all afternoon. [whispering] Michael is terrified of bob.
[whispering] Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?
You're arrogant and pompous, and I don't like you.
You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why aren't you wearing the hairnet?
Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?
So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ?
What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
You know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess.
I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee.  I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine.
Maybe that'll help. Is it cold in there?
So, we're all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes?
Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done. [laughs]
Oh, I don't think it's blackmail.  Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight.  I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.
Tom?  He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. [blank stares] Tom? [acts like she's shooting herself in the head] Pow.
No, I think they mean more like a politician.
You know what? I don���t know where the years went. �����Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don���t even recognize them.
Did the police solve the problem with the...
Sort of. He had a lot of clients.
When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?
I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y.
[gasps] Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She's doing a book signing right now.
[Pam walks out of the bathroom wearing her new red shirt] Woooooow.
He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.
We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while.
[seeing a large red spot on Michael's lip] God! Wow!
Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]
Well, Andy���s cute, but he���s too vanilla, whereas Pete - he���s just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird.
Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her ���gy-na��� for your entire meeting.
How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?
It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
Oh, ok. [Phyllis signs for the package, opens an empty box]
First message is: 'I love you'.  That's from me.
We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.
I would like to toast to the good fortune I've been having lately...
Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people.
No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.
Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.
Whose hands are these? [holding out her hands to Jim] Theyre not my hands. I don���t know.
There was no client.  Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car.  I had to walk home with no money and no phone.
Look, I don���t feel safe. I think we should call the police.
Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California?
Dwight, you can���t go. You have a problem with women. You can���t sell to them.
So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?
Oh, we find little times during the day.
Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didn't have enough time for them?
You must have misdialed. This is Phyllis. No, I'm not sure what his extension is. [glares at Stanley as he glares right back]
Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene.
Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes. [Angela and Pam look uncomfortable]
I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.
Michael, you always said we were a family.  Then you went after us.
We're laughing at this cartoon! [passes newspaper to Dwight]
The guy who sits behind me and the guy who sits across from me are fighting to see who becomes my boss. [laughs]
I need you to get rid of the tree.
I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.
Aw, what the hell? [goes to Vance Refrigeration] Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?
I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go?
He asked if you've been acting withdrawn lately.
You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.
Come on, Bob.  Raise your hand. [Bob does so reluctantly]
I almost quit my job so I could be closer to Bob, and we're in the same building.
Mmm... sometimes her stockings have a run in them.
We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen.
You could put your cell phone in it instead.
Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob.
It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.
Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud.
Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby.  Sheet cake.
[snatches ring] Then another woman will get it. We can't allow that. We have to destroy it.
I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her.
I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it?
We have a gym at home. It���s called the bedroom.
Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!
Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client.
I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense. But, they're also really fluffy.
You can pay me back later for the makeover.
Hey, Andy!  Maybe this is one of those situations where you just have to do her to get her out of your system.
What were you doing in the ladies room?!
You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know.
I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.
[under her breath] There's another party in the break room.
And this brings us to you, little one.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I gave you a penguin.
Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?
Andy, don���t make us sell this stupid thing.
I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that.
Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it?
Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?
I invited someone to the party. Bob Vance. He works at Vance Refrigeration next door. That's how we met. [whispers] He's my boyfriend.
It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.
Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.
I wonder what people like about me? ... Probably my jugs.
Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things.
Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain.
Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money.
I don't care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise.
It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
[laughing] Yeah, we really did peel your grapes.
Are you gonna give me the leads or not?
Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?
Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering.
I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.
Michael... [Kelly enters conference room in a flirty red dress]
Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What?
The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?
Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. [footage of Dwight and Angela making out] I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.
Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it.
Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.
We think you made a big, big mistake.
That's a halwa shabkia cookie.  They serve it during Ramadan. [Angela spits her cookie out]
So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?
Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.
He and Pam are having their Valentine's Day lunch.
I'm glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he's stupid.
In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let's put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle's eye! Let the party begin! [Dwight plugs in tree lights, office applauds.]
It is so nice to go out with another couple.
Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.
Yes, I got those cute little ones. [Angela looks at her disapprovingly] Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?
We-we found some wet cement in the park...
Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person.
If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four.
Michael, just give us our clients back.  That's all we care about.
I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.
I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up shot glass] I don't think they're appropriate anymore.
We know the branch is closing; Michael told us.
I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle]
As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.
[holds up mittens she's knitting] Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.
Come on, Dwight, I think it's actually healthy to get it off your chest.
Do you have any idea what time we'll get out of here?
I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down  she wouldn't be a good wife.
Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?
I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.
Why couldn't have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?
Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play.
Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?
That's funny.  Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it. [glares at Stanley's date]
Michael, you make fun of us every day.
Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk.
Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It���s all garbage okay? You���re the woman, I���m the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.
Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?
Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest?
Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin's hair with her hand]
Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?
So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.
[notices Andy boxing up things from Erin's desk] What are you doing?
Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley.
If you're just handing them out, I want one too.
Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So...  [Jim gestures for her to continue]
Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited.
[singing] Here I go again on my own.  Going down the only road I've ever known...
How is that possible?  No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?
It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
You can pick one of these things.  It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.
It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone.  Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.
Someone needs to clean it.  It smells like popcorn.
Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know.
I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
What's gonna make you feel better, big guy?
You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?
If I wanted Jamaican food I'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.
Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.
But I won't be able to do inventory without it.
Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.
It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy.'
You don't even know what I'm talking about.
I, uh, I met a man and I'm totally in love, and that's a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts...
When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.
Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He���s not terrible.
Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. [Kevin nods] Okay.
Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?
[Micheal dressed as Phyllis, pretending to knit] Well, what are you talking about? [cracking noise] Ohh! Ohh! [falls onto the ground] I've fallen and I can't get up!
I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs.
Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.
What's the least we can do to make this okay?
Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke.
Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.
Yeah, Dwight's right we should drop a bomb.
Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that���s Italian.
[on phone] I know, I know.  We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.
Michael. You know, when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?
Can I get a list of your vendors?
Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?
No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
Yeah, thank you. [As Phyllis enjoys Bob's meat, Jim and Pam look knowingly into the camera]
Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.
[hands Jim folder] Ask for Donald, Karen���s bananas.
Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.
She just crossed her arms together... that's bad.
I can't see half of the things. [adjusts glasses]
You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK?  [in character] I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.
Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.
Angela, you'll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it's the generic one. It's Stanley's favorite.
Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside.
An hour? I can't stay here an hour.
[as everyone returns to the office] Ah, geez. My nails aren't dry yet. I don't think I can work for at least a couple hours.
Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.
Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---
I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I...
[Phyllis, Pam, Toby, and Oscar are sharing iPod headphones] I don't understand.  Which one is that?
Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You've been very good this year -
I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?
One time I said good morning to her, and she didn't say it back.
Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients.
[in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes?
I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.
Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.
Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures?
Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.
I didn't ask you where it was.  I told you where it needs to be.
How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?
Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy.
Where did you save the list of exchanges?
Well, thanks.  I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.
[to Ernesto] I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?
I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly...
That's what I said. He was spying in the ladies' room.
It's times like these, I wish my mother were with me right now.  She'd show me what to do.  That's stupid; she's not here.  [looks at watch] She's at water aerobics for the next forty-five minutes.
[grabs phone] Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle?
Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme.
It's not like you can fire people or anything.
Oh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't.
Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it.
Oh, are those your kids? They���re so cute! They could be models.
I don���t think I should walk anymore.  You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast.  Two poached eggs.  And then half a sandwich on the bus.
Well, we'll deal with it as it comes.
I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't.
Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out.
Lots of things are cozy in the rain.
Oh! When you got your new phone, that's when you asked for everyone's attention.
I don't care what she's doing.  I just hope she keeps doing it.
Close your mouth, sweetie.  You look like a trout.
You promised me this. Don't make me get Bob involved!
I was all-county my junior and senior years.
He was looking at me in the ladies' room.
C���mon, just say you saw the list by accident.
I can't be around sad people, it makes me sad.
I'll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.
Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.
Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry.
Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy.
We���re all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen]
Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer.
[dressed as Raggedy Ann] Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?
[groaning while trying to open giant wine bottle] ha ha!
Call us when you get there so we know you're OK. [Andy gets up and leaves]
No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat.
When I was growing up, my mom said, 'the sky's the limit.'  I could do anything.  Be a teacher's aide, nurse's assistant, some kind of volunteer.  But now, I, I'm not so sure.
Write him up or I'll take it to Jan.
Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high. [gets out of elevator; hears moans and heavy breathing coming from office; opens door and sees Dwight and Angela making out]
[on phone] Well, who can do a party of this size?  But you're in the business, you must surely know of some other businesses.  Okay, well, I JUST WANT A DAMN DANCE FLOOR!  Sorry. So sorry, I shouldn't have sworn, I'm so sorry.  Um, thanks for your time. [knock on door]  What?  Sorry, I shouldn't have said 'what' like that, it was really rude.
Oh, well, I'm already married.  Boys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses.
I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. It���s hopeless.
But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
I know Sue. She's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheelchair, right?
You don't have to kiss his ass anymore.
It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.
I think Jim would be a good boss. Plus he's eye candy. It's OK, Bob... Vance knows he's on my list. Um, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jim, and that British guy that got in trouble with a prostitute.
Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?
Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up.
This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!
[quietly, to Andy] Put your hand up, Norma Rae.
No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day. [smiles]
Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for.
Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't...
Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
I'm excited about today. [whispers] I love girl talk.
When I say it out loud it's so silly. [they both laugh]
Yeah, I really like Stanley, but I'm not always sure if he likes me. I guess that's okay, 'cause I don't really like him.
Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.
Mmm, this won't help him, it's a muffin, not cake.
Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.
But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out.
Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading.
Of course you don't wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn't even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical.
I don't need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone.
Hit it, red! [���Boogie Wonderland��� by Earth Wind & Fire plays as Darryl dances with each member of the office]
It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good!
Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too.
Mm. I like your shoes. [Kelly has 5-inch heels on]
They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.
After 16 years, it���s strange sitting across from somebody who isn���t Stanley. But���he���ll get there.
But you don't know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
Dwight! [Dwight pulls out a hunting knife and jumps off desk]
I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today.  I'm really happy being here.
I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school.
Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping.
Hi Michael. [Michael sits on her lap] Mm. 'kay.
Okay. [opens door] It���s just the wind, see? Nothing.
You left me in a bad part of town!
Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars.
What in the name of God is going on?!
I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.
Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.
Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.
[storms in the office, sweaty and out of breath] Are you insane?!
Oh I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held.
I'm sorry.  It's the largest one I have.
I have a new swimsuit I need to break in....
Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand.
[Balls up post-its and throws them in Angela's face]
You don���t have to thank us for coming in, it���s our job.
Haven't you been following the news? Ther university is using its non-profit status to fund its private real estate investments.
Well, Bob was going to just drive me.
Andy, I���ve been worried about you. How are you?
No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.
I'm good baby. [they kiss, both dressed as Santa]
Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela's having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.
No. [trying to finish her sale when Michael hangs up the phone] I'm on a sale!
We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.
Yeah, the Syracuse branch can���t be happy you���re taking New York clients.
Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck.
Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you.
