Okay, fine. Cash it is.
So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?
But I didn't report your snoring-
Andy's running over Dwight with his car.
You are my little teddy bear. I wantcha.
Is she Asian?
Yeah, it can���t be nothing.
Wow.
Where would you like the Rice Krispy Treat stars?
Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.
Are you all packed?
Yeah, who wrote it?
We did our best.
Ooh. Isn't that the one where the guy becomes limitless?
In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let's put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle's eye! Let the party begin! [Dwight plugs in tree lights, office applauds.]
Okay. [opens door] It���s just the wind, see? Nothing.
Thanks.
Where did you save the list of exchanges?
Yeah, I got stung up my dress.
Oh...
Sure.
Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that���s Italian.
Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited.
Well, Andy���s cute, but he���s too vanilla, whereas Pete - he���s just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird.
Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it?
Yeah, cupcakes. That's what I said.
Hmm?
Yes I do.
Andy sings beautifully. And he���s really good at dancing. He���s a good speaker. But there���s just something there you don���t want to look at.
I have my hug.
If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?
Then how is this 'Amazing Race'?
I'm glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he's stupid.
Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?
Hey. I like.
Thanks.
I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it?
No we���re not.
Robert's house is, well....I don't mean to sound offensive, but it's like where a basketball player would live.
Perfect. I hate registries.
Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?
[dressed as Raggedy Ann] Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?
[Gasps] Oh my god!
No, there���s wine in here.
It's going well.
You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday.
Oh. Someplace with a pool, then?
Mm.
Role call.
What does that even mean?
Disgusting...
[gasps] What does it say?
Oh, I like Olive Garden.
It's really something.
That wasn't me.
Dwight, stop it.
That's despicable.
Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned.
It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning!
I am jumping.
It is so nice to go out with another couple.
[chuckling] Who takes a kid to Mexico?
My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you?
[grabs phone] Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle?
Yeah, there you go. [laughter]
Hi.
Let me get you some water.
Yeah, I���m not ready for this.
She's real good.
It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.
Why wouldn't she?
On more week. [chuckles]
Yeah, I would, too.
He should pay.
I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her.
Umm I don't know Michael.
Oh, I have a flush!
Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.
If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four.
We���re gonna cover for you, ya know.
Oh.
How much wine do you have?
What? Is Dan okay?
Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five.
What does that even mean?
Dancing babies!
Then what was this all about?
See?
That's true.
Why couldn't have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?
The three of us have all been chairmen before.
We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.
Jim's gonna love it. [Karen giggles]
20 cartons of it's coming, on it's way.
Move on, Michael.
No, you knew me in high school.  Course, we all thought you were gay in high school.
Aw, what the hell? [goes to Vance Refrigeration] Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?
Dwight, get out of here!
[whispering to Angela] I don't like you.
I think Jim would be a good boss. Plus he's eye candy. It's OK, Bob... Vance knows he's on my list. Um, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jim, and that British guy that got in trouble with a prostitute.
I have a new swimsuit I need to break in....
Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money.
He's talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy.
[in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes?
Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me?  We'll take all afternoon. [whispering] Michael is terrified of bob.
Hillary Swank.
I hope he's ok, I feel bad.
Make them kiss each other.
We think you made a big, big mistake.
No. Jim... [wine bottle clangs on plate]
Hi.
Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things.
That's the character's name?
I'm the same age as you, Michael.
Are you alright?
So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.
I don���t think I should walk anymore.  You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast.  Two poached eggs.  And then half a sandwich on the bus.
Do you have a black eye?
What's the case, Toby?
It's fish.
Never mind, I shouldn't have said that.
Oh.
Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... it's stupid, forget it.
Drew isn't a girl... She's Andy.
Oh! [Michael laughs]
Why were you peering over the stalls?!
I'll talk to her, Michael.
What else you got?
Ouch. Sorry, Andy, that���s-.
Oh dear.
Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars.
If you're just handing them out, I want one too.
It's nice to learn new things.
Found him!
Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious.
And it didn't change your mind.
Is there any mustard?
Oh, sorry, it's your job.
Yes. Put the DVD in.
That's great!
What is it?
That's no pimple Michael.
Put it down
You know your perfumes!
[seeing a large red spot on Michael's lip] God! Wow!
When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.
Michael... No.
You left me in a bad part of town!
Hi guys.
Andy He's gone.
I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that.
You know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess.
Uh, on or off?
[at Michael return to Jim's office] Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!
I can't see half of the things. [adjusts glasses]
Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What?
Good. Good.
Well?
You mean the clients you stole from us.
It's my back.
You can pay me back later for the makeover.
Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So...  [Jim gestures for her to continue]
Did you even try?
What?
That's still a lot of money!
[muffled] No, I swallowed a crown.
Does it hurt terribly?
Yeah, what's the reason?
I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs.
You, are, a pervert!
I have a friend who's single.
You don���t have to thank us for coming in, it���s our job.
Goodnight Pam. [Leaves with oversized bear on back.]
Whose hands are these? [holding out her hands to Jim] Theyre not my hands. I don���t know.
This is ridiculous.  We just can't wait here.
You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.
I thought Terry knew about Cynthia?
C���mon, just say you saw the list by accident.
You're gonna compete against us?
Oh, it's coming.
[sobbing] No.
Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It���s all garbage okay? You���re the woman, I���m the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.
Hey, Andy!  Maybe this is one of those situations where you just have to do her to get her out of your system.
Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.
We bury him?
Um, The DaVinci Code.
Your show was really great, Andy.
[to Stanley] Hey, I did good too!
Or the mini mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. You can get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your [to Nellie] boyfriend. But, I mean, if you don't have one of those you can probably just bring whoever it is you use to kill your loneliness.
Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?
Okay.
That feels good, Dwight.
Back!
I'm sorry,
Andy.
Oh, ok.
You can pick one of these things.  It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.
That's fair.
I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up shot glass] I don't think they're appropriate anymore.
Stanley, you're dancing!
Where are we going this afternoon?
Sexually?
Did you have a nice drive in?
Mmm-hmm.
You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.
Yeah, I really like Stanley, but I'm not always sure if he likes me. I guess that's okay, 'cause I don't really like him.
No Bob, we worked it out.
We're not mocking, we're watching.
And if the food stations are here and here... no!  Here and here.  Drinks here, then people can mingle.  But then where would the band go?
Oh, I know I'd be more productive.
I don't think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I...
OK.
What's going on?
How's your hearing?
Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?
I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?
[to Angela] So this is...
What does that mean?
Oh Michael.
Why?
Really? I thought they were pretty...
Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer.
What do we do? How do we stop this?
Magical...
I don't get it.
Yes.
What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.
Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didn't have enough time for them?
Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested.
Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand.
It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.
Teri's out of town, Michael.
Oh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't.
Dwight, get out of here!!
An hour? I can't stay here an hour.
No way.
Hey, where���s my ring?
How is that possible?  No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?
Sir, you have some messages.
Ass.
[laughing] Thought we were playing for fun.
Afghani.
Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it.
Come on, Pam.
Ok... nice.
Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too.
I'd rather have the bowl.
I wonder what people like about me? ... Probably my jugs.
Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.
I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y.
[Dwight's footsteps sound from the ceiling] Just drive away. Just..
Come on Andy, they're a good match.
During our honeymoon safari in Africa, Bob and I were driving late at night, and he'd been drinking, and suddenly thump.  We hit something with our jeep.  It was probably a man.  We didn't know what to do.  We heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us, so we just kept driving as fast as we could.  We bribed the airline, got on a plane that night, and fled home.  Maybe it was just an ostrich.  In a soccer uniform.
Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.
Mistake.
In our neighborhood...
Yes, it's marijuana.
Okay.
Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X?
Michael.
I have a sports bra.
The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?
Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. [Kevin nods] Okay.
Hit it, red! [���Boogie Wonderland��� by Earth Wind & Fire plays as Darryl dances with each member of the office]
I said no.
How do you know it's a gun?
Angela, you'll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it's the generic one. It's Stanley's favorite.
What are we supposed to talk about?
Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.
Are you good at homemade?
Um, let's see... it's fine.
Congratulations!
It'll be all right.
That's awful.
Oh. [looks away]
Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done. [laughs]
I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't.
Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
That seemed to shut her up.
Eleven, wow!
[to Pam] I'll tell you later.
I like your frames.
Who was Pam's first celebrity crush?
Well, there's green, um, blue... yellow... red...
Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela's having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.
Made love? I don't know.
Oh, it can be fun.
Yeah...
You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it.
Stanley and I are close, too.
Yeah, that sounds right.
Clark!
Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob.
Wait. This says ���Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge���?
Yes.
Just go.
I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.
Isn't he sweet?
Oh, are those your kids? They���re so cute! They could be models.
He was looking at me in the ladies' room.
I almost quit my job so I could be closer to Bob, and we're in the same building.
Backups. [Jim goes to join the backups]
Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes?
Hmm.
Jim, I am so f[bleep]ed.
Mmm, whatcha got?
He needs to rest.
Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?
[laughing] Oh, you can afford it.
Yes, I got those cute little ones. [Angela looks at her disapprovingly] Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?
Oh, I'll help you find it.
Sic him!
All right sweetie, I'll tell her its Michael.
We���re all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
Oh, I don't think you're being silly.
He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.
Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person.
What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it?
Oh, the plants are gonna love this.
[hugging Andy]. Andy���
She's out of your league Andy.
Did you get any clients back?
An asset!
Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it.
No, he���s good.
You're making a knife with a knife?
Uh...
Hey, I hear Jim's coming back.
I think you look nice.
Did you see...
We know the branch is closing; Michael told us.
I'm really sorry. It was earlier today.
Cold, huh?
No..we don't
Oh, Lord in heaven.
Awww, it's kissing its mommy!
I thought it was...
Yeah, thank you. [As Phyllis enjoys Bob's meat, Jim and Pam look knowingly into the camera]
It's labeled.
When I was growing up, my mom said, 'the sky's the limit.'  I could do anything.  Be a teacher's aide, nurse's assistant, some kind of volunteer.  But now, I, I'm not so sure.
I didn't ask you where it was.  I told you where it needs to be.
Now this is getting ridiculous.
Mm. I like your shoes. [Kelly has 5-inch heels on]
It's cute. [plays with it]
Cool.
[points to the ceiling] You deserve it.
I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.
Just wear one of your bowties.
You tell me.  Well, you do mean you and Jim right?  Oh God.  I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and you're talking all the time.  I'm sorry!
Yeah.
Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.
You want to talk about it?
It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.
No. [trying to finish her sale when Michael hangs up the phone] I'm on a sale!
Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.
Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene.
[under her breath] There's another party in the break room.
What in the name of God is going on?!
Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.
No.
I don't have that, Dwight.
Oh I got the 'Save The Date'.
Which one's Glee?
It's, it's fine.
Cookies?
It looks pretty black.
Damn.
Okay, let's do it.
Well--
Okay.
Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay.  Everything else goes in the drawer.
Oh.
Church isn't a party, Michael.
Why?
Michael. You know, when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?
I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.
That's not a good idea, Michael.
You could put your cell phone in it instead.
All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?
Sure.
They're not getting married. It's just talk.
As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.
Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.
A furnace?
No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.
Okay, forget it. [walks away]
You guys are together?
What's going on?
You're arrogant and pompous, and I don't like you.
Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.
Wanna dance, Dwight?
But the rattler's so scary.
What don't you get?
Well, I guess that's not-
Oh, boy...
I'll do it.
Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?
Okay... [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
I have ears, Dwight.
We-- we--
I think you're remembering that wrong?
How about pepperoni?
[raises hand] Here.
You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know.
What consequences?
[snatches ring] Then another woman will get it. We can't allow that. We have to destroy it.
Oh! I forgot my purse.
Wait���.they���re terrified?
Here's her carrier, but no Cece.
You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder.
Someone needs to clean it.  It smells like popcorn.
Thank you.
I think it's good.
Dwight?
Not according to the beans.
All right.
Who's that?
Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out.
I don't know, I'm not used to the stress.
I think it's gonna be Michael.
Maybe Florida.
What's gonna make you feel better, big guy?
I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it. [she awkwardly hugs Jim] It's been a long journey... but [sniffles] I'm Santa Claus!
Oh, I'd love to but, um-
Mmm-hmm. Moneybags. Must be nice.
[laughing] Yeah, we really did peel your grapes.
What's he doing?
Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud.
Oh, we wouldn't.  We love Stevie Wonder.
What do you mean?
Whew, well. I guess that���s that.
It's really cute.
This is weird.
Val.
Ten...
Are you calling me a ho?
Mm-hmm, near the river.
It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy.'
Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't...
Ms. Thomas, so good to see you.
Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?
I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works.
Pam.
They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
Oh! When you got your new phone, that's when you asked for everyone's attention.
I, uh, I met a man and I'm totally in love, and that's a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts...
Hey!
How was jury duty?
Oh, don't be such a baby.
Who?
Dwight! Dwight!
Hi.
Good luck!
[on phone] Well, who can do a party of this size?  But you're in the business, you must surely know of some other businesses.  Okay, well, I JUST WANT A DAMN DANCE FLOOR!  Sorry. So sorry, I shouldn't have sworn, I'm so sorry.  Um, thanks for your time. [knock on door]  What?  Sorry, I shouldn't have said 'what' like that, it was really rude.
[also to Darryl] Good morning.
Four.
There's nothing to know, it's just gossip.
I'm just saying hi to Bob.
Michael, you should stay home and rest.
Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy.
Well, what about the other guys.
Why isn't Dwight turning around?
It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was.
[sigh] What are you making?
Yes, I'm jumping.
One time I said good morning to her, and she didn't say it back.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
OK. Packer can go to hell.
Do you think they'll get the account. [Stanley stares at her] How come you never answer me?
After 16 years, it���s strange sitting across from somebody who isn���t Stanley. But���he���ll get there.
Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl.
It's times like these, I wish my mother were with me right now.  She'd show me what to do.  That's stupid; she's not here.  [looks at watch] She's at water aerobics for the next forty-five minutes.
We have a right to know.
Yeah.
We don't feel that way.
So, we're all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes?
Go get 'em Dwight.
But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
I think it's a fun idea.
Yes, very.
You found Uncle Al!
What's wrong with you?
Say 'Me eat cookie.'
Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious.
That's funny.  Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it. [glares at Stanley's date]
What are these for?
Yeah.
We have a gym at home. It���s called the bedroom.
I actually sleep better when it's raining.
We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen.
Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt.  You should be apologizing to us.
We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.
Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance?
Yes.
How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?
Did you plan it?
Don���t you have any sunblock?
It's the lining of the stomach of--
It's the only gavel I could find.
Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client.
Is it true you're buying the company?
Do you have any idea what time we'll get out of here?
Michael?
I need you to get rid of the tree.
Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest?
Sugarplum fairy wands.
The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing.
Maybe that'll help. Is it cold in there?
I say no.
Well, this could be fun. I-
So, uh, show us how you���d normally sell to a female client.
Yeah.
But where would we...go?
Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering.
Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. It���s hopeless.
Does he die?
My mom taught me that.
Oh, yeah. You'll have to put out.
Hey, you two having fun?
But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out.
Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.
I can't be around sad people, it makes me sad.
Yeah, real cool. Real power move.
Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You've been very good this year -
Thank you, Dwight. These are nice.
He and Pam are having their Valentine's Day lunch.
Okay.
Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?
Yeah that was a surprise...
This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee.  The theme is 'Nights in Morocco'.  This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party.  Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate.
He's a real catch and you should take him back.
Really, Oh, they're from Bob again.
Michael, Michael.
I���ll try this one.
I didn't really get a good look.
Oh.
Shut up. You're a freak!
Dwight, you can���t go. You have a problem with women. You can���t sell to them.
Well, Bob was going to just drive me.
I could try to seduce him.
How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?
Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly...
It's just me here.
Haven't you been following the news? Ther university is using its non-profit status to fund its private real estate investments.
Did the police solve the problem with the...
Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen]
Got it.
Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her ���gy-na��� for your entire meeting.
Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He���s not terrible.
Luke? Luke!
They make you feel lighter...
What are you asking?
What does the furnace do?
Michael.
It's not like you can fire people or anything.
You're kidding...
I was all-county my junior and senior years.
Lose the twirl.
What should we ask?
Hey.
[notices Andy boxing up things from Erin's desk] What are you doing?
So you went homemade this year.
I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind.
[into phone] Phyllis Vance for David Wallace.
Yeah, I don't even have a laptop.
No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.
[laughs] Yeah.
It's a combo dance house coffee bar.
I know Sue. She's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheelchair, right?
How far along is Pam?
[whispering] It's about Michael.
I invited someone to the party. Bob Vance. He works at Vance Refrigeration next door. That's how we met. [whispers] He's my boyfriend.
I have an ice cream cake in the car.
You said fruit, Michael.
Which thing?
Definitely Jim.
[hands Jim folder] Ask for Donald, Karen���s bananas.
You sound worried.
Yes.
Yes you were.
What's the least we can do to make this okay?
Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?
Michael, that's awful.
Excuse me?
Wow! Sorry!
Dwight said it's 'Hog maw.'
Ohhh...
It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone.  Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.
Michael. [Michael throws Phyllis' keys under the car.]
Yeah. Poor Angela.
You don't even like us as friends?
I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today.  I'm really happy being here.
Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can���t just press a magic button.
But we invited guests.
What--
Yeah.
You can't be in here!
Okay.
It's not gonna get better; he's gonna steal all of our clients.
No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients.
What do you mean?
Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk.
Hey, how's Annie?
[Balls up post-its and throws them in Angela's face]
[laughs] Yeah.
Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play.
I'll do it.
Michael, you always said we were a family.  Then you went after us.
You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?
I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.
Jim, don't listen to Andy.  I think it's so romantic.
Dwight! [Dwight pulls out a hunting knife and jumps off desk]
Well, there is a ball.
Guys, we can���t let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back.
Afghani.
Oh, that's the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties.
You are a pervert!
Wow. Sounds scary.
Michael, what will you do?
Michael, you make fun of us every day.
That must have been hard.
Close your mouth, sweetie.  You look like a trout.
It's a secret.
Okay... [removes glasses]
Wait, what?
Ryan.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Hey, this is your apology letter.
That can't be right.
Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again.
Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading.
Yeah. Yeah. Oh.
She just crossed her arms together... that's bad.
I don't need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone.
Ow! Ee! I sat on my sandwich.
David Wallace called this meeting?
I'm excited about today. [whispers] I love girl talk.
Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]
Helpless.
We're laughing at this cartoon! [passes newspaper to Dwight]
You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.
I'll just go get a ginger ale.
Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck.
I'm telling Michael.
The guy who sits behind me and the guy who sits across from me are fighting to see who becomes my boss. [laughs]
Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
I don't care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise.
We already said no.
So he won't get caught!
Open the door, Jim.
Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.
[to Dwight] Do you believe that?!
Bestiality. Yeah.
We don���t work for you!
Why should I have to thank him?
Andy, I���ve been worried about you. How are you?
No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.
Thank you, Michael.
Her hair looks beautiful.
I know. I thought you two were nice together.
I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense. But, they're also really fluffy.
Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?
I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I'm on.
Me.
It's not me, either.
Angela���s special repairman is here.
Yes.
It's nice, like Up.
Um-hmmm.
Call a doctor.
[as everyone returns to the office] Ah, geez. My nails aren't dry yet. I don't think I can work for at least a couple hours.
Ooh.
Did you send him to the slammer?
Thanks guys.
Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.
Is there any mustard?
I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
What are you -
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus!
OK.
[laughing] It's good!
Order carrot cake. [laughter]
I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.
I did.
Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
He does have a moustache.
Michael, I was doing so well.
[whispers] I'm clicking!
She does have very nice clothes.
What's 'Scott's Tots?'
Hi Michael. [Michael sits on her lap] Mm. 'kay.
What's happening to you Michael?
But you don't know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
No.
They're important.
This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!
Lots of things are cozy in the rain.
Oh.
I am clicking.
You shot Dwight?
Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts. [Michael stares at her incredulously] But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads.
I'm sorry.  It's the largest one I have.
Oh, boy... You...
Popcorn.
When?
I'm telling Michael.
Now you move on.
Mmm... sometimes her stockings have a run in them.
I���m happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
What? [everyone is confused]
Oh I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held.
Why would you do that?
You didn't decorate it?
Good night, Andy.
[raises hand] Hey, Michael. I mean Jim.
I thought you said green was whorish.
Oh, dear.
When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?
Yeah, pretty stationery.
Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know.
Oh, we're in a meeting.
I was...
[Phyllis, Pam, Toby, and Oscar are sharing iPod headphones] I don't understand.  Which one is that?
But it's closer to you.
Are you glad to be back?
Oh, well, I'm already married.  Boys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses.
Oh, I���m gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.
Stanley! [hugs Stanley]
That's a halwa shabkia cookie.  They serve it during Ramadan. [Angela spits her cookie out]
Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.
Oh, you say that every time.
Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for.
Oh God.
No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day. [smiles]
I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.
This says 'Bushiest Beaver'.
I have an ace.
Told you so.
I can't feel my toes.
Come on, Dwight, you're making this up.
Her nephew's in Iraq.
I was just getting a snack.
[to Kelly] Who's that?
Is that Cici?
Yeah!
No.
Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme.
Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em.
You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK?  [in character] I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.
Let me help you us.
[Micheal dressed as Phyllis, pretending to knit] Well, what are you talking about? [cracking noise] Ohh! Ohh! [falls onto the ground] I've fallen and I can't get up!
Live and learn.
Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures?
Why are you here, Todd?
I don't think he'd do that.
Where's your place?
Wow, thirteen!
This is stupid.
What the hell?!
Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up.
[to customer] Can you help me?
Um, I had scoliosis as a girl.
Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here.
Yeah, sign says 'Begin tour here.'
But I won't be able to do inventory without it.
Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---
Yeah, good. Don't do it.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I gave you a penguin.
Yeah, it's just a picnic.
I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down  she wouldn't be a good wife.
This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood!
[whispers] Yes.
Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry.
Are you sure? Yeah, it's locked.
Umm, no, she's a professional softball player.
I love their breadsticks!
A lot of mines in Scranton.
What are you wearing?
What are you? A monk?
Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.
You must have misdialed. This is Phyllis. No, I'm not sure what his extension is. [glares at Stanley as he glares right back]
[out of breath] Bowling.
Well, we'll deal with it as it comes.
Oh, some fudge?
I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality.
Sort of. He had a lot of clients.
No.
You've got no taste Stanley Hudson.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. [laughs]
Michael, just give us our clients back.  That's all we care about.
It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good!
Michael, what happened?
No. Sorry.
[to Ernesto] I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?
You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary.  [sighs] No offense, Jim.  I think she's very pretty.
It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
Those sound too harsh.
Sorry. Plastered.
Put it down.
I'm out too.
No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat.
I couldn't see your hands. [Jim shakes his hands] Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK?
I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.
So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?
I think he left.
First message is: 'I love you'.  That's from me.
Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high. [gets out of elevator; hears moans and heavy breathing coming from office; opens door and sees Dwight and Angela making out]
Yeah, I lost my client.
Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people.
Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes. [Angela and Pam look uncomfortable]
Or should I have corndogs. I mean-
Really?
Wait, they have food there?
Yeah you have this sexy glow.
[storms in the office, sweaty and out of breath] Are you insane?!
[whispering] Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?
Yeah, I like Oscar.
You got dumped?
[quietly, to Andy] Put your hand up, Norma Rae.
And napkins... fanned.
Hey, I'm collecting for the baby shower.
I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke.
Cake.
Oh, we find little times during the day.
Oh sure, a little piece.  Ooh, no mushroom though.
C.C
It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
She's not hot.
Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you.
I don't know, they're both handsome.
Call us when you get there so we know you're OK. [Andy gets up and leaves]
Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. [Michael laughs]
What smell?
It sure looked good on the mannequin.
Is that ladle stainless or...
Andy, don���t make us sell this stupid thing.
You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...
Elliot.
I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school.
[knocks files off desk] Sorry.
[phone rings] Hello?  Hi Bob Vance. [laughs]
He means the ice pack.
[on phone] I know, I know.  We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.
[holds up mittens she's knitting] Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.
Ooh, why is it shaped like that?
Michael! Come on!
Oh, that's great news for your friend.
Where do we get those?
Hi sweetie.
No. Call Bob.
That's...
Oh, ok. [Phyllis signs for the package, opens an empty box]
Oh no, they're still not done.
...and a big walk-in closet.
And I imagine things are starting to heat up?
Yeah, Dwight's right we should drop a bomb.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
I know, Kevin.
No, I think they mean more like a politician.
And when you fell in, did you flounder?
One more, one more! [cheers and applause]
Michael!
I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.
That's what I said. He was spying in the ladies' room.
Sorry.
I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee.  I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine.
I think he-
Keep me out of it.
Again with the cousin.
Michael, why would we all go to the dump?
He asked if you've been acting withdrawn lately.
Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.
I'll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.
There was no client.  Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car.  I had to walk home with no money and no phone.
One, two three! [group takes shots]
What���s it now, dream or no dream?
Oh, I'll just duck my head in.
Mmm, this won't help him, it's a muffin, not cake.
If I wanted Jamaican food I'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.
It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
Ass.
Unbelievable.
[moans in pain]
Come on! This isn't fair!
No, just go home.
Andy!
Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
[gasps] Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She's doing a book signing right now.
I think I just got flashed.
You don't have to kiss his ass anymore.
It's unbelievable!
Yeah, the Syracuse branch can���t be happy you���re taking New York clients.
We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while.
I'll see what I can find out.
Of course you don't wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn't even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical.
Oh, really good, I went to Portugal.
Yeah mostly.
Jim was supposed to collect it.
Really?
I'm bringing someone.
Thanks Angela.
[dancing with Stanley] I missed you.
I'm good baby. [they kiss, both dressed as Santa]
Work.
Kevin, take your shoes off first!
So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ?
Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby.  Sheet cake.
[groaning while trying to open giant wine bottle] ha ha!
What were you doing in the ladies room?!
In the parking lot.
When I say it out loud it's so silly. [they both laugh]
Please Michael.
So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you -
I do.
I guess so...
Oh! Mother ******!
Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.
Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?
You think that Andy's family owned slaves?
If my daughter were asking me... [both giggle]
No, hey, Dwight shouldn���t...
What did you do, Andy?
You promised me this. Don't make me get Bob involved!
I'm in too.
Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please? [Erin moves Oscar out of the way for Phyllis]
There's always a theme.
Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!
It���s just the wind.
Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?
Ow, my ankle!
You are...
Dwight is our new boss.
No, it's 4:35.
What's on your suit?
I'm gonna go call Bob.
Maybe I'll quit.
That's right. Yeah.
Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?
Why would you do that?
Mm-hmm.
Dwight, get out of here!
You should, you should put out salt for the rims [referring to margaritas]
Okay that's enough.
For your signature. [drops document on Michael's desk]
Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw.  So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this. [whispering] So we're gonna try out some new things today.
What?
Where are we going?
A restaurant.
I don't care what she's doing.  I just hope she keeps doing it.
You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why aren't you wearing the hairnet?
I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.
My perfume?
Hey!
Welcome to your party.
I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.
