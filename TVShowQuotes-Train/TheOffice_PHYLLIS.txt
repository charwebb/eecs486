We don't feel that way.
You're welcome.
Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.
I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing.
Your show was really great, Andy.
All right sweetie, I'll tell her its Michael.
[hands Jim folder] Ask for Donald, Karen���s bananas.
No. Call Bob.
It's cute. [plays with it]
Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You've been very good this year -
Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he���s gone for who knows how long.
I think you look nice.
Oh! When you got your new phone, that's when you asked for everyone's attention.
What don't you get?
Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!
He was looking at me in the ladies' room.
Yeah.
Awww, it's kissing its mommy!
Oh, I'm sorry.  I gave you a penguin.
Wait. This says ���Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge���?
I think it's good.
Mmm, no Bob, I don't know.
Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. [Michael laughs]
Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know.
Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand.
Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.
Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people.
We know the branch is closing; Michael told us.
Sure.
Maybe Florida.
Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby.  Sheet cake.
Oh, sorry, it's your job.
I have a sports bra.
Oh, well, I'm already married.  Boys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses.
Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl.
You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.
[to customer] Can you help me?
No, you knew me in high school.  Course, we all thought you were gay in high school.
Let me get you some water.
Michael, you always said we were a family.  Then you went after us.
I could try to seduce him.
Open the door, Jim.
Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious.
But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
Well?
Ok... nice.
I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y.
Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it?
Yes.
I'll just go get a ginger ale.
Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?
Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering.
Okay.
Did you have a nice drive in?
Yeah, I���m not ready for this.
Let's do it!
Then how is this 'Amazing Race'?
Hey, I hear Jim's coming back.
Oh.
Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance?
I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.
I can't see half of the things. [adjusts glasses]
I'm sorry, everybody.
This is really nice Dwight, thanks.
Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?
What were you doing in the ladies room?!
You don't have to kiss his ass anymore.
If I wanted Jamaican food I'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.
Thank you, Dwight. These are nice.
Come on, Pam.
I'm sitting right here Dwight.
Yeah mostly.
Again with the cousin.
Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen]
But it's closer to you.
[muffled] No, I swallowed a crown.
Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious.
Where did you save the list of exchanges?
Ryan, hand the phone over.
Split the commission?
Found him!
Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson���s a mean old grump. [laughs] But [crying] would a grump make this? It���s me. It���s me.
Ooh. Isn't that the one where the guy becomes limitless?
I invited someone to the party. Bob Vance. He works at Vance Refrigeration next door. That's how we met. [whispers] He's my boyfriend.
Perfect. I hate registries.
Is there any mustard?
Oh, yeah. You'll have to put out.
Completely.
It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was.
Yeah, I got stung up my dress.
Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.
Okay.
Ow! Ee! I sat on my sandwich.
Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?
Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.
Oh, I'll help you find it.
You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK?  [in character] I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.
Michael... [Kelly enters conference room in a flirty red dress]
[grabbing the coffee] Hot!
Yes.
Did the police solve the problem with the...
That's true.
I think he left.
You can't be in here!
Where's your place?
Poor, poor Andy.
Andy!
Teri's out of town, Michael.
If my daughter were asking me... [both giggle]
Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. [footage of Dwight and Angela making out] I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.
Okay, forget it. [walks away]
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus!
Yes. Put the DVD in.
Yeah, sign says 'Begin tour here.'
Oh.
I���ll try this one.
Well, I guess that's not-
Michael, I was doing so well.
Well, thanks.  I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.
Yes.
What? Is Dan okay?
Yeah!
Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.
It's going well.
They're important.
It's nice to learn new things.
Say 'Me eat cookie.'
Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.
Oh...
Andy's running over Dwight with his car.
I can't feel my toes.
I'm in too.
I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense. But, they're also really fluffy.
Or the mini mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. You can get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your [to Nellie] boyfriend. But, I mean, if you don't have one of those you can probably just bring whoever it is you use to kill your loneliness.
The first thing I'd buy is new boobs. For my mom. She has the worst boobs. It- It's embarrassing.
Church isn't a party, Michael.
Dwight! Dwight!
We���re gonna cover for you, ya know.
What's happening to you Michael?
[notices Andy boxing up things from Erin's desk] What are you doing?
Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin's hair with her hand]
Really, Oh, they're from Bob again.
In our neighborhood...
Oh Michael.
Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far.
Mm.
Yeah.
Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading.
Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts. [Michael stares at her incredulously] But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads.
Yes, I'm jumping.
Okay.
Live and learn.
You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know.
I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go?
You can pick one of these things.  It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.
My perfume?
All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?
Do you have any idea what time we'll get out of here?
[to Stanley] Hey, I did good too!
Ms. Thomas, so good to see you.
I know. I thought you two were nice together.
[grabs phone] Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle?
Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again.
I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.
[raises hand] Hey, Michael. I mean Jim.
I'll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.
We don���t work for you!
[laughing] It's good!
[on phone] Well, who can do a party of this size?  But you're in the business, you must surely know of some other businesses.  Okay, well, I JUST WANT A DAMN DANCE FLOOR!  Sorry. So sorry, I shouldn't have sworn, I'm so sorry.  Um, thanks for your time. [knock on door]  What?  Sorry, I shouldn't have said 'what' like that, it was really rude.
I'll do it.
We already said no.
Back!
No.
Where are we going?
Whose hands are these? [holding out her hands to Jim] Theyre not my hands. I don���t know.
But you don't know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
You are...
Andy sings beautifully. And he���s really good at dancing. He���s a good speaker. But there���s just something there you don���t want to look at.
Ohhh...
Here's her carrier, but no Cece.
Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw.  So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this. [whispering] So we're gonna try out some new things today.
That's still a lot of money!
Me.
Oh, ok.
Yeah, pretty stationery.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. [laughs]
Yeah, cupcakes. That's what I said.
Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.
Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela's having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.
We did our best.
Her nephew's in Iraq.
Umm, no, she's a professional softball player.
That's a halwa shabkia cookie.  They serve it during Ramadan. [Angela spits her cookie out]
Mm-hmm.
That's fair.
It is so nice to go out with another couple.
Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke.
He and Pam are having their Valentine's Day lunch.
I am clicking.
This is stupid.
Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.
It���s just the wind.
Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy.
A restaurant.
One time I said good morning to her, and she didn't say it back.
Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain.
This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!
Is that ladle stainless or...
Um, I had scoliosis as a girl.
Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X?
That's what I said. He was spying in the ladies' room.
Come on! This isn't fair!
How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?
Does he die?
I thought maybe DJ's.
Just wear one of your bowties.
Yeah you have this sexy glow.
Dwight is our new boss.
Who was Pam's first celebrity crush?
You found Uncle Al!
Yeah.
Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.
Sorry. Plastered.
[whispers] Yes.
Michael. You know, when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?
Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money.
I'm getting married to Bob Vance.
Yeah, who wrote it?
[sigh] What are you making?
Stanley and I are close, too.
That's great!
Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?
Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. It���s hopeless.
Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?
I thought Terry knew about Cynthia?
[storms in the office, sweaty and out of breath] Are you insane?!
I think you're remembering that wrong?
Afghani.
Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
I didn't really get a good look.
Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her ���gy-na��� for your entire meeting.
Are you good at homemade?
Okay, fine. Cash it is.
I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
I guess so...
[phone rings] Hello?  Hi Bob Vance. [laughs]
Oh.
Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you.
Yes.
[in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes?
When I was a little girl...
So you went homemade this year.
The girls school?
Okay.
Are you alright?
You know your perfumes!
It's a secret.
You know what? I don���t know where the years went. �����Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don���t even recognize them.
I don't care what she's doing.  I just hope she keeps doing it.
Cake.
[Micheal dressed as Phyllis, pretending to knit] Well, what are you talking about? [cracking noise] Ohh! Ohh! [falls onto the ground] I've fallen and I can't get up!
[Phyllis, Pam, Toby, and Oscar are sharing iPod headphones] I don't understand.  Which one is that?
Hi guys.
I have a new swimsuit I need to break in....
No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?
She's real good.
My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you?
When I say it out loud it's so silly. [they both laugh]
Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.
The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?
Welcome to your party.
No, just go home.
What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.
[hugging Andy]. Andy���
Jim, don't listen to Andy.  I think it's so romantic.
Keep me out of it.
An Xbox it is. Because I've decided you're a good boy.
Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that���s Italian.
Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.
Oh, are those your kids? They���re so cute! They could be models.
Excuse me?
Told you so.
When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.
An asset!
I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.
Hello Angela.
Made love? I don't know.
[Takes here gift out of her bowl] Oh. What are these?
Which thing?
Look, I don���t feel safe. I think we should call the police.
Come on, Bob.  Raise your hand. [Bob does so reluctantly]
You are a pervert!
And when you fell in, did you flounder?
C.C
What consequences?
Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned.
Ryan.
One more, one more! [cheers and applause]
You are my little teddy bear. I wantcha.
I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it?
Angela, you'll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it's the generic one. It's Stanley's favorite.
It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.
Whew, well. I guess that���s that.
I'm telling Michael.
What's 'Scott's Tots?'
[dressed as Raggedy Ann] Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?
Are you all packed?
Well--
How about pepperoni?
Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. [Kevin nods] Okay.
...and a big walk-in closet.
I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school.
Yeah, I would, too.
Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't...
[to Ernesto] I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?
What?
Oh, you say that every time.
Drew isn't a girl... She's Andy.
Congratulations!
Popcorn.
Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?
Michael, that's awful.
Sorry.
I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?
Dwight, get out of here!
Cookies?
Did you plan it?
So is it an open relationship?
So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?
Yeah.
Hi.
Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it.
Well, Bob was going to just drive me.
Oh, really good, I went to Portugal.
Hmm.
Oh, it can be fun.
You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...
Why would you do that?
Dwight, you can���t go. You have a problem with women. You can���t sell to them.
You've got no taste Stanley Hudson.
Her hair looks beautiful.
What���s it now, dream or no dream?
Really? I thought they were pretty...
But the rattler's so scary.
Isn't he sweet?
No, he���s good.
We're not mocking, we're watching.
Haven't you been following the news? Ther university is using its non-profit status to fund its private real estate investments.
He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.
It's unbelievable!
It'll be all right.
Elliot.
Did you get any clients back?
You said fruit, Michael.
[points to the ceiling] You deserve it.
Why would you do that?
Okay... [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning!
Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It���s all garbage okay? You���re the woman, I���m the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.
Is she Asian?
Yeah, Dwight's right we should drop a bomb.
I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today.  I'm really happy being here.
That's a shame.  Ed was a good guy.
[quietly, to Andy] Put your hand up, Norma Rae.
Where would you like the Rice Krispy Treat stars?
Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited.
What did you do, Andy?
Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out.
We started selling balloons.
You want to talk about it?
Are you glad to be back?
You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why aren't you wearing the hairnet?
What do you mean?
In the parking lot.
Oh I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held.
Hey!
We-- we--
Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.
What do you mean?
What? [everyone is confused]
It's not gonna get better; he's gonna steal all of our clients.
No.
Oh.
Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry.
I'll see what I can find out.
He means the ice pack.
No.
What's the least we can do to make this okay?
What is it?
Write him up or I'll take it to Jan.
There was no client.  Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car.  I had to walk home with no money and no phone.
I did.
I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up shot glass] I don't think they're appropriate anymore.
What does that even mean?
What are we supposed to talk about?
[laughing] Yeah, we really did peel your grapes.
They're not getting married. It's just talk.
I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down  she wouldn't be a good wife.
Oh sure, a little piece.  Ooh, no mushroom though.
Yes, it's marijuana.
Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too.
No. Sorry.
Well, there's green, um, blue... yellow... red...
Thank you, Michael.
This is weird.
That's the character's name?
I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works.
I'd rather have the bowl.
[also to Darryl] Good morning.
Mm-hmm, near the river.
Michael.
And this brings us to you, little one.
Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high. [gets out of elevator; hears moans and heavy breathing coming from office; opens door and sees Dwight and Angela making out]
I think Jim would be a good boss. Plus he's eye candy. It's OK, Bob... Vance knows he's on my list. Um, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jim, and that British guy that got in trouble with a prostitute.
Someone needs to clean it.  It smells like popcorn.
I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.
Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one.
It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
You didn't decorate it?
Are you sure? Yeah, it's locked.
[dancing with Stanley] I missed you.
[to Angela] So this is...
Pam.
After 16 years, it���s strange sitting across from somebody who isn���t Stanley. But���he���ll get there.
What's gonna make you feel better, big guy?
Does it hurt terribly?
Hey. I like.
The guy who sits behind me and the guy who sits across from me are fighting to see who becomes my boss. [laughs]
Well, we'll deal with it as it comes.
Thanks.
Oh, Michael.
Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up.
You don���t have to thank us for coming in, it���s our job.
Wow! Sorry!
No.
Sexually?
I was just getting a snack.
Oh, Lord in heaven.
How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?
But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out.
Really?
Yeah. Yeah. Oh.
I'm really sorry. It was earlier today.
Uh...
Oh, some fudge?
But where would we...go?
I actually sleep better when it's raining.
Sorry, Michael, I don't think they're real.
OK.
Let me help you us.
Play it again.
Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud.
Oh, dear.
He should pay.
You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder.
I'm the same age as you, Michael.
Yeah, I don't even have a laptop.
That's not a good idea, Michael.
What should we ask?
Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay.  Everything else goes in the drawer.
Got it.
Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?
You left me in a bad part of town!
That seemed to shut her up.
Okay.
I'm gonna go call Bob.
So he won't get caught!
I don���t think I should walk anymore.  You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast.  Two poached eggs.  And then half a sandwich on the bus.
Who?
I love their breadsticks!
Of course you don't wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn't even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical.
And I imagine things are starting to heat up?
No, I think they mean more like a politician.
Move on, Michael.
Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.
I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
I don't get it.
Sure.
What does that mean?
Did you see...
Yes, very.
During our honeymoon safari in Africa, Bob and I were driving late at night, and he'd been drinking, and suddenly thump.  We hit something with our jeep.  It was probably a man.  We didn't know what to do.  We heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us, so we just kept driving as fast as we could.  We bribed the airline, got on a plane that night, and fled home.  Maybe it was just an ostrich.  In a soccer uniform.
Yeah, good. Don't do it.
Michael, just give us our clients back.  That's all we care about.
Do you have a pole?
Who's that?
Yeah, it can���t be nothing.
Andy.
What's going on?
Sic him!
You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.
[to Kelly] Who's that?
[whispering] Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?
Ass.
Mm. I like your shoes. [Kelly has 5-inch heels on]
Oh! Mother ******!
Why wouldn't she?
Then what was this all about?
See?
[laughs] Yeah.
[gasps] What does it say?
What--
We're in the same High School class.
Okay, let's do it.
Are you calling me a ho?
I don't think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
Yeah that was a surprise...
Know what?
A furnace?
Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars.
If you're just handing them out, I want one too.
Hey, I'm collecting for the baby shower.
I was all-county my junior and senior years.
We���re all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
[singing] Here I go again on my own.  Going down the only road I've ever known...
One, two three! [group takes shots]
Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?
It's nice, like Up.
That must have been hard.
Magical...
Mmm, this won't help him, it's a muffin, not cake.
Hi.
It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.
Unbelievable.
Thanks.
Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please? [Erin moves Oscar out of the way for Phyllis]
I don't know, I'm not used to the stress.
Oh. [looks away]
You know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess.
She's not hot.
That's funny.  Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it. [glares at Stanley's date]
[Dwight's footsteps sound from the ceiling] Just drive away. Just..
Now you move on.
That's...
You must have misdialed. This is Phyllis. No, I'm not sure what his extension is. [glares at Stanley as he glares right back]
You mean the clients you stole from us.
What does that even mean?
What smell?
But we invited guests.
And it didn't change your mind.
You don't even like us as friends?
Mmm, whatcha got?
Oh.
Yeah.
OK.
Yeah, that sounds right.
[to Stanley] Hey! Good to have you back.
Yeah, the Syracuse branch can���t be happy you���re taking New York clients.
[into phone] Phyllis Vance for David Wallace.
You could put your cell phone in it instead.
Yeah?
Dwight...
There's always a theme.
It's really something.
Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me?  We'll take all afternoon. [whispering] Michael is terrified of bob.
[Balls up post-its and throws them in Angela's face]
Wow.
Okay... [removes glasses]
Come on, Dwight, you're making this up.
Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... it's stupid, forget it.
Wow. Sounds scary.
Wait���.they���re terrified?
Dwight! [Dwight pulls out a hunting knife and jumps off desk]
Oh, I like Olive Garden.
Dwight, get out of here!
That wasn't me.
Lots of things are cozy in the rain.
Why?
I don't have that, Dwight.
Michael, why would we all go to the dump?
[as everyone returns to the office] Ah, geez. My nails aren't dry yet. I don't think I can work for at least a couple hours.
I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that.
Thanks Angela.
No, it's lettuce.
[snatches ring] Then another woman will get it. We can't allow that. We have to destroy it.
[laughing] Thought we were playing for fun.
Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?
Ten...
[under her breath] There's another party in the break room.
No.
Mmm... sometimes her stockings have a run in them.
C���mon, just say you saw the list by accident.
Yes, I got those cute little ones. [Angela looks at her disapprovingly] Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?
Okay that's enough.
When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?
Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.
Eleven, wow!
We bury him?
Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest?
We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.
Oh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't.
I know
Why were you peering over the stalls?!
Yeah, what's the reason?
No..we don't
It's really cute.
Do you think they'll get the account. [Stanley stares at her] How come you never answer me?
Oh no, they're still not done.
Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.
Oh, boy... You...
Wow, thirteen!
Work.
Yes you were.
No, there���s wine in here.
Kevin, take your shoes off first!
He's talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy.
You, are, a pervert!
I thought you said green was whorish.
[to Pam] I'll tell you later.
Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.
I think it's a fun idea.
Oh, this isn't good.
No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.
Sic him!
Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What?
Thanks guys.
In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let's put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle's eye! Let the party begin! [Dwight plugs in tree lights, office applauds.]
Andy, I���ve been worried about you. How are you?
You sound worried.
[seeing a large red spot on Michael's lip] God! Wow!
What?
What are you -
Oh I got the 'Save The Date'.
Goodnight Pam. [Leaves with oversized bear on back.]
[chuckling] Who takes a kid to Mexico?
David Wallace called this meeting?
But I didn't report your snoring-
Oh God.
Michael!
And if the food stations are here and here... no!  Here and here.  Drinks here, then people can mingle.  But then where would the band go?
Sort of. He had a lot of clients.
Hit it, red! [���Boogie Wonderland��� by Earth Wind & Fire plays as Darryl dances with each member of the office]
Shut up. You're a freak!
Michael.
What's wrong with you?
Oh, it's coming.
Yeah.
[gasps] Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She's doing a book signing right now.
No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day. [smiles]
Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer.
Oh! I forgot my purse.
[raises hand] Here.
[groaning while trying to open giant wine bottle] ha ha!
I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.
I know Sue. She's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheelchair, right?
I like your frames.
Guys, we can���t let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back.
Umm I don't know Michael.
There's nothing to know, it's just gossip.
Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs.
It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone.  Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.
I need you to get rid of the tree.
Well, this could be fun. I-
I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it. [she awkwardly hugs Jim] It's been a long journey... but [sniffles] I'm Santa Claus!
[out of breath] Bowling.
No we���re not.
You shot Dwight?
Those sound too harsh.
I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.
I have an ice cream cake in the car.
Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.
Ooh, why is it shaped like that?
Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.
I knitted it for you.
You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?
I am jumping.
What else you got?
Robert's house is, well....I don't mean to sound offensive, but it's like where a basketball player would live.
Oh, don't be such a baby.
You're arrogant and pompous, and I don't like you.
Yeah, thank you. [As Phyllis enjoys Bob's meat, Jim and Pam look knowingly into the camera]
Is it true you're buying the company?
You're kidding...
What in the name of God is going on?!
So, uh, show us how you���d normally sell to a female client.
Yeah...
Helpless.
I do.
I do.
Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.
We think you made a big, big mistake.
How's your hearing?
Val.
Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.
Dwight, stop it.
Or should I have corndogs. I mean-
Yes I do.
But I won't be able to do inventory without it.
[on the phone] You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
Good. Good.
Michael, Michael.
Is there any mustard?
We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen.
[Pam walks out of the bathroom wearing her new red shirt] Woooooow.
So, we're all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes?
Oh dear.
All right.
[laughing] Oh, you can afford it.
...report you to HR.
Come on Andy, they're a good match.
I'm telling Michael.
Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley.
Oh, I have a flush!
Where do we get those?
You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it.
Why couldn't have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?
Stanley, you're dancing!
That can't be right.
This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood!
This says 'Bushiest Beaver'.
It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy.'
Do you have a black eye?
This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee.  The theme is 'Nights in Morocco'.  This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party.  Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate.
Andy He's gone.
Mmm-hmm.
Michael, you make fun of us every day.
He's a real catch and you should take him back.
Yeah, I really like Stanley, but I'm not always sure if he likes me. I guess that's okay, 'cause I don't really like him.
That's no pimple Michael.
You're making a knife with a knife?
Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em.
Oh, that's the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties.
Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.
A lot of mines in Scranton.
Hi sweetie.
We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while.
No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.
Dwight?
[at Michael return to Jim's office] Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!
Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.
No, the one before that.
Jim, I am so f[bleep]ed.
Damn.
I... twisted it.
You don't even know what I'm talking about.
You think that Andy's family owned slaves?
[to Dwight] Do you believe that?!
Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here.
Dwight was in the ladies' room and he was looking at me.
I have ears, Dwight.
Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for.
What are you gonna do?
Was there a fistfight?
Okay. [opens door] It���s just the wind, see? Nothing.
Um, The DaVinci Code.
I have a friend who's single.
Good night, Andy.
They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.
It's, it's fine.
On purpose.
What?
We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.
What the hell?!
That's awful.
She's out of your league Andy.
Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping.
It's not me, either.
I have my hug.
I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her.
I'm sorry,
Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures?
I think it's gonna be Michael.
Stanley! [hugs Stanley]
On more week. [chuckles]
What's going on?
Did you send him to the slammer?
I'm bringing someone.
Oh, that's great news for your friend.
I can't be around sad people, it makes me sad.
Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play.
Good luck!
Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly...
You promised me this. Don't make me get Bob involved!
Yeah, that���s all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?
It's the only gavel I could find.
[leaving the room] Excuse me.
Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt.  You should be apologizing to us.
You're gonna compete against us?
Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five.
Role call.
I like her purple dress.
Oh! [Michael laughs]
I don't need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone.
I don't know, they're both handsome.
Why are you here, Todd?
[knocks files off desk] Sorry.
Yes.
When?
Are you gonna give me the leads or not?
What are you? A monk?
Thank you.
Where are we going this afternoon?
How was jury duty?
Bestiality. Yeah.
Mmm-hmm. Moneybags. Must be nice.
Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]
The only Santa.
You should, you should put out salt for the rims [referring to margaritas]
Oh, I'd love to but, um-
Yeah. Poor Angela.
Really?
Hey, you two having fun?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, the plants are gonna love this.
Come on, Dwight, I think it's actually healthy to get it off your chest.
Oh, I don't think it's blackmail.  Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight.  I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.
Clark!
It's times like these, I wish my mother were with me right now.  She'd show me what to do.  That's stupid; she's not here.  [looks at watch] She's at water aerobics for the next forty-five minutes.
It's a combo dance house coffee bar.
It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
What did we write?
So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ?
Put it down.
Andy, don���t make us sell this stupid thing.
Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California?
I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.
He does have a moustache.
No. [trying to finish her sale when Michael hangs up the phone] I'm on a sale!
I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that...
What's the case, Toby?
Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can���t just press a magic button.
An hour? I can't stay here an hour.
I think I just got flashed.
It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
Oh. Someplace with a pool, then?
Mmm-hmm.
So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?
Bye everyone.
Disgusting...
Wanna dance, Dwight?
You tell me.  Well, you do mean you and Jim right?  Oh God.  I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and you're talking all the time.  I'm sorry!
What are these for?
I'm out too.
No way.
[whispers] I'm clicking!
Close your mouth, sweetie.  You look like a trout.
Why should I have to thank him?
I'm just saying hi to Bob.
That feels good, Dwight.
Oh, we wouldn't.  We love Stevie Wonder.
Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it?
Ow, my ankle!
Sir, you have some messages.
Oh, we find little times during the day.
What's on your suit?
It's my back.
Hey!
Hmm?
How far along is Pam?
It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good!
Definitely Jim.
Did you even try?
Make them kiss each other.
Dancing babies!
I'm sorry.  It's the largest one I have.
Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene.
I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.
No, hey, Dwight shouldn���t...
I don't think he'd do that.
If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four.
Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So...  [Jim gestures for her to continue]
He asked if you've been acting withdrawn lately.
I couldn't see your hands. [Jim shakes his hands] Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK?
Jim's gonna love it. [Karen giggles]
No, she is the boss.
It's not like you can fire people or anything.
Jim was supposed to collect it.
Yeah, it's just a picnic.
Tom?  He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. [blank stares] Tom? [acts like she's shooting herself in the head] Pow.
We have a right to know.
Michael! Come on!
Hi.
Order carrot cake. [laughter]
You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality.
[holds up mittens she's knitting] Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.
No. Jim... [wine bottle clangs on plate]
[on phone] I know, I know.  We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.
Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?
For your signature. [drops document on Michael's desk]
Just go.
Is that Cici?
I'm excited about today. [whispers] I love girl talk.
Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client.
The three of us have all been chairmen before.
Which one's Glee?
I was...
Hey, Andy!  Maybe this is one of those situations where you just have to do her to get her out of your system.
Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---
That's right. Yeah.
I'm glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he's stupid.
Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person.
Maybe I'll quit.
You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary.  [sighs] No offense, Jim.  I think she's very pretty.
Go get 'em Dwight.
Hello.
Oh, boy...
[Gasps] Oh my god!
I���m happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
It sure looked good on the mannequin.
Um-hmmm.
Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck.
What do we do? How do we stop this?
Maybe that'll help. Is it cold in there?
We're laughing at this cartoon! [passes newspaper to Dwight]
Angela���s special repairman is here.
Michael, what happened?
Hey, how's Annie?
Why isn't Dwight turning around?
Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it.
I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.
Oh, I know I'd be more productive.
Yeah.
Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things.
He's always been terrible with money.
Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?
I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't.
It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.
Yeah.
Ass.
If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?
Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk.
You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday.
Oh, I don't think you're being silly.
I wonder what people like about me? ... Probably my jugs.
What are you asking?
Luke? Luke!
I don't get it.
Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.
[sobbing] No.
I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee.  I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine.
Michael?
Um, let's see... it's fine.
I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I'm on.
Not according to the beans.
Aw, what the hell? [goes to Vance Refrigeration] Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?
Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients.
First message is: 'I love you'.  That's from me.
Backups. [Jim goes to join the backups]
[crying] Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn't supposed to take no for an answer.
Lose the twirl.
Uh, on or off?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
It's a big order. Thanks Kenny.
Michael. [Michael throws Phyllis' keys under the car.]
Yeah, I like Oscar.
Why?
I know, Kevin.
Michael, you should stay home and rest.
I would like to toast to the good fortune I've been having lately...
Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested.
I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind.
We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.
What's he doing?
Well, what about the other guys.
Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes?
We-we found some wet cement in the park...
Yeah, there you go. [laughter]
