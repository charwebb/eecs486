Dwight?
Oh, yeah. You'll have to put out.
[notices Andy boxing up things from Erin's desk] What are you doing?
Oh, dear.
Yeah, I would, too.
You are my little teddy bear. I wantcha.
Mm. I like your shoes. [Kelly has 5-inch heels on]
It's cute. [plays with it]
Sure.
Perfect. I hate registries.
Yeah, thank you. [As Phyllis enjoys Bob's meat, Jim and Pam look knowingly into the camera]
You left me in a bad part of town!
Are you calling me a ho?
Oh, we find little times during the day.
I... twisted it.
He's a real catch and you should take him back.
If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four.
Ow, my ankle!
Michael, just give us our clients back.  That's all we care about.
What's on your suit?
Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. [Kevin nods] Okay.
Just wear one of your bowties.
[laughing] Yeah, we really did peel your grapes.
Or should I have corndogs. I mean-
Oh. [looks away]
Role call.
All right sweetie, I'll tell her its Michael.
Awww, it's kissing its mommy!
Made love? I don't know.
What are you? A monk?
Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?
Angela, you'll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it's the generic one. It's Stanley's favorite.
Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients.
Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand.
What are we supposed to talk about?
What consequences?
I'll just go get a ginger ale.
What were you doing in the ladies room?!
Dwight...
I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.
So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?
He needs to rest.
Completely.
Dwight! [Dwight pulls out a hunting knife and jumps off desk]
Where did you save the list of exchanges?
Are you alright?
Mmm, no Bob, I don't know.
What���s it now, dream or no dream?
Okay.
I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today.  I'm really happy being here.
Maybe I'll quit.
Michael.
Michael. [Michael throws Phyllis' keys under the car.]
Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play.
First message is: 'I love you'.  That's from me.
I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs.
That seemed to shut her up.
I'd rather have the bowl.
No.
This is stupid.
It's not gonna get better; he's gonna steal all of our clients.
What's gonna make you feel better, big guy?
Michael... [Kelly enters conference room in a flirty red dress]
We think you made a big, big mistake.
Her nephew's in Iraq.
What?
Write him up or I'll take it to Jan.
Michael, that's awful.
I don't get it.
One, two three! [group takes shots]
Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far.
Um, I had scoliosis as a girl.
This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!
Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures?
It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning!
Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it.
I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
[snatches ring] Then another woman will get it. We can't allow that. We have to destroy it.
That must have been hard.
How far along is Pam?
Well, what about the other guys.
I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down  she wouldn't be a good wife.
Wow! Sorry!
Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people.
Why would you do that?
Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.
I did.
It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.
Oh! I forgot my purse.
I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I'm on.
A furnace?
Close your mouth, sweetie.  You look like a trout.
Oh, Michael.
Oh, ok.
Hey, Andy!  Maybe this is one of those situations where you just have to do her to get her out of your system.
Yeah, cupcakes. That's what I said.
Oh, I'll help you find it.
Stanley! [hugs Stanley]
That's true.
How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?
Oh! Mother ******!
Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly...
This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee.  The theme is 'Nights in Morocco'.  This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party.  Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate.
Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know.
Jim, I am so f[bleep]ed.
This is ridiculous.  We just can't wait here.
You are...
Oh, don't be such a baby.
Let's do it!
Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
I'll do it.
I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee.  I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine.
I have a friend who's single.
Yes.
Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for.
Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What?
Yes I do.
I think Jim would be a good boss. Plus he's eye candy. It's OK, Bob... Vance knows he's on my list. Um, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jim, and that British guy that got in trouble with a prostitute.
Mmm-hmm. Moneybags. Must be nice.
He's always been terrible with money.
Dwight was in the ladies' room and he was looking at me.
I'll talk to her, Michael.
Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby.  Sheet cake.
Oh, some fudge?
[gasps] Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She's doing a book signing right now.
We don't feel that way.
I have a new swimsuit I need to break in....
Hi.
Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela's having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.
[phone rings] Hello?  Hi Bob Vance. [laughs]
I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle]
Come on, Pam.
You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?
Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?
Yeah.
Oh, I���m gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.
What are you gonna do?
What is it?
Dwight, stop it.
Yeah, pretty stationery.
See?
No, the one before that.
[groaning while trying to open giant wine bottle] ha ha!
Go get 'em Dwight.
What's going on?
Andy He's gone.
My perfume?
My mom taught me that.
Thank you.
Drew isn't a girl... She's Andy.
I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school.
Oh, I'd love to but, um-
Mm-hmm, near the river.
I'm good baby. [they kiss, both dressed as Santa]
What's 'Scott's Tots?'
Sort of. He had a lot of clients.
Sorry.
I know Sue. She's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheelchair, right?
That's no pimple Michael.
What in the name of God is going on?!
You can pick one of these things.  It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.
I'm just saying hi to Bob.
It's going well.
That feels good, Dwight.
Michael!
Andy sings beautifully. And he���s really good at dancing. He���s a good speaker. But there���s just something there you don���t want to look at.
You know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess.
What's happening to you Michael?
Oh.
What?
[grabbing the coffee] Hot!
Yeah.
The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?
And if the food stations are here and here... no!  Here and here.  Drinks here, then people can mingle.  But then where would the band go?
[under her breath] There's another party in the break room.
No, there���s wine in here.
In our neighborhood...
This says 'Bushiest Beaver'.
Yes, very.
The only Santa.
Dancing babies!
You didn't decorate it?
[seeing a large red spot on Michael's lip] God! Wow!
Those sound too harsh.
You can pay me back later for the makeover.
Look, I don���t feel safe. I think we should call the police.
Of course you don't wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn't even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical.
Come on! This isn't fair!
Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.
Is it true you're buying the company?
What else you got?
Magical...
Well, there is a ball.
Oh, that's great news for your friend.
This is really nice Dwight, thanks.
I can't see half of the things. [adjusts glasses]
Hi.
Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?
All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?
Is there any mustard?
Michael. You know, when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?
Oh, this isn't good.
Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?
Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it?
Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done. [laughs]
And when you fell in, did you flounder?
Oh.
Well, this could be fun. I-
You must have misdialed. This is Phyllis. No, I'm not sure what his extension is. [glares at Stanley as he glares right back]
They're not getting married. It's just talk.
Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious.
Jim, don't listen to Andy.  I think it's so romantic.
I'm sorry.  It's the largest one I have.
I thought it was...
Hello.
Cool.
We started selling balloons.
Bye everyone.
It's nice to learn new things.
Oh I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held.
Here's her carrier, but no Cece.
Found him!
Yeah, good. Don't do it.
[to Pam] I'll tell you later.
Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?
Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious.
Thanks.
[whispering] It's about Michael.
I know
You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why aren't you wearing the hairnet?
How was jury duty?
[hands Jim folder] Ask for Donald, Karen���s bananas.
I couldn't see your hands. [Jim shakes his hands] Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK?
I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.
We're laughing at this cartoon! [passes newspaper to Dwight]
Split the commission?
I'm really sorry. It was earlier today.
I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense. But, they're also really fluffy.
Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside.
Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.
Well, Andy���s cute, but he���s too vanilla, whereas Pete - he���s just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird.
Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry.
[to Stanley] Hey, I did good too!
You are a pervert!
You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.
I have my hug.
As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.
[into phone] Phyllis Vance for David Wallace.
Oh God.
Well?
Haven't you been following the news? Ther university is using its non-profit status to fund its private real estate investments.
I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
What don't you get?
Hey, how's Annie?
[to Stanley] Hey! Good to have you back.
I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.
No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.
What? Is Dan okay?
I am clicking.
Hi Michael. [Michael sits on her lap] Mm. 'kay.
It's a combo dance house coffee bar.
Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out.
But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
Dwight! Dwight!
Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading.
Yeah?
Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... it's stupid, forget it.
What's the least we can do to make this okay?
What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
Oh! When you got your new phone, that's when you asked for everyone's attention.
This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood!
Backups. [Jim goes to join the backups]
Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.
I didn't ask you where it was.  I told you where it needs to be.
Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me?  We'll take all afternoon. [whispering] Michael is terrified of bob.
No. Sorry.
I could try to seduce him.
You think that Andy's family owned slaves?
I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that.
Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
It's nice, like Up.
Dwight, get out of here!!
Are you good at homemade?
I'm the same age as you, Michael.
Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.
Hey. I like.
You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday.
Work.
Yeah, Dwight's right we should drop a bomb.
Oh, it's coming.
Oh, I'll just duck my head in.
Is that Cici?
On purpose.
Make them kiss each other.
Yes. Put the DVD in.
Yeah, there you go. [laughter]
Sexually?
Her hair looks beautiful.
Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!
Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene.
Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.
An Xbox it is. Because I've decided you're a good boy.
I say no.
Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?
Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen]
The first thing I'd buy is new boobs. For my mom. She has the worst boobs. It- It's embarrassing.
Did you see...
We did our best.
[whispering] Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?
Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl.
Who's that?
And napkins... fanned.
I said no.
Hey, where���s my ring?
I don't think he'd do that.
Church isn't a party, Michael.
No.
What did you do, Andy?
You sound worried.
Sure.
I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.
Ten...
Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin's hair with her hand]
I like her purple dress.
Now you move on.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
What do you mean?
That's great!
I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.
You're arrogant and pompous, and I don't like you.
[on phone] I know, I know.  We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.
Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk.
Wait���.they���re terrified?
Michael, you should stay home and rest.
Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You've been very good this year -
What do we do? How do we stop this?
Oh sure, a little piece.  Ooh, no mushroom though.
Your show was really great, Andy.
You said fruit, Michael.
Okay, let's do it.
Congratulations!
Michael.
Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he���s gone for who knows how long.
Is there any mustard?
It's times like these, I wish my mother were with me right now.  She'd show me what to do.  That's stupid; she's not here.  [looks at watch] She's at water aerobics for the next forty-five minutes.
I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind.
When?
Luke? Luke!
You, are, a pervert!
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus!
Yeah, the Syracuse branch can���t be happy you���re taking New York clients.
Whose hands are these? [holding out her hands to Jim] Theyre not my hands. I don���t know.
[points to the ceiling] You deserve it.
My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you?
What should we ask?
Oh Michael.
He and Pam are having their Valentine's Day lunch.
Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He���s not terrible.
No. Jim... [wine bottle clangs on plate]
Hmm?
So, we're all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes?
No.
I am jumping.
You want to talk about it?
Oh I got the 'Save The Date'.
Sugarplum fairy wands.
Isn't he sweet?
Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.
He asked if you've been acting withdrawn lately.
That's fair.
I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her.
Mmm, whatcha got?
Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?
They make you feel lighter...
Okay... [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
How much wine do you have?
What's he doing?
So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?
Why couldn't have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?
We're not mocking, we're watching.
You can't be in here!
Good night, Andy.
Why isn't Dwight turning around?
Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?
Stanley and I are close, too.
Then what was this all about?
So you went homemade this year.
He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.
Mmm... sometimes her stockings have a run in them.
But we invited guests.
Why?
Move on, Michael.
Okay, forget it. [walks away]
Well, Bob was going to just drive me.
Hmm.
Does it hurt terribly?
Ouch. Sorry, Andy, that���s-.
Why were you peering over the stalls?!
[to Dwight] Do you believe that?!
No, you knew me in high school.  Course, we all thought you were gay in high school.
Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob.
There's always a theme.
Popcorn.
So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you -
Yeah.
[laughing] Oh, you can afford it.
Yeah, I don't even have a laptop.
Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em.
Elliot.
It's a secret.
Ahhh! [falls out of chair]
Oh, we wouldn't.  We love Stevie Wonder.
Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance?
Why?
Oh, I don't think it's blackmail.  Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight.  I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.
Okay... [removes glasses]
No.
Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. [footage of Dwight and Angela making out] I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.
You found Uncle Al!
I'll do it.
Really?
Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.
Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up.
Did you send him to the slammer?
I was all-county my junior and senior years.
You promised me this. Don't make me get Bob involved!
I wonder what people like about me? ... Probably my jugs.
Put it down.
I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
Oh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't.
I'm sorry, everybody.
Yes.
Michael... No.
What did we write?
I'm sitting right here Dwight.
Angela���s special repairman is here.
Where's your place?
Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested.
We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.
Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.
Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping.
Excuse me?
No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.
Yeah!
Umm, no, she's a professional softball player.
Or the mini mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. You can get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your [to Nellie] boyfriend. But, I mean, if you don't have one of those you can probably just bring whoever it is you use to kill your loneliness.
Is she Asian?
[knocks files off desk] Sorry.
Oh.
Oh, Lord in heaven.
In the parking lot.
Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]
A restaurant.
On more week. [chuckles]
I don't care what she's doing.  I just hope she keeps doing it.
You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it.
I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up shot glass] I don't think they're appropriate anymore.
You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.
You could put your cell phone in it instead.
Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes?
I think you look nice.
[to Ernesto] I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?
No..we don't
Which one's Glee?
Dwight is our new boss.
Oh, we're in a meeting.
No, it's 4:35.
Welcome to your party.
What are you wearing?
I guess so...
Whew, well. I guess that���s that.
So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.
Wow.
Yeah, I got stung up my dress.
Live and learn.
It's fish.
If you're just handing them out, I want one too.
Michael! Come on!
I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go?
[muffled] No, I swallowed a crown.
Um, let's see... it's fine.
[dancing with Stanley] I missed you.
Umm I don't know Michael.
I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.
Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering.
Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited.
It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy.'
Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts. [Michael stares at her incredulously] But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads.
That's a shame.  Ed was a good guy.
He means the ice pack.
Where do we get those?
Oh...
We-we found some wet cement in the park...
After 16 years, it���s strange sitting across from somebody who isn���t Stanley. But���he���ll get there.
[Phyllis, Pam, Toby, and Oscar are sharing iPod headphones] I don't understand.  Which one is that?
Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her ���gy-na��� for your entire meeting.
I, uh, I met a man and I'm totally in love, and that's a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts...
Oh, it can be fun.
Again with the cousin.
Thank you, Michael.
Mmm-hmm.
We bury him?
Did you have a nice drive in?
Yeah, real cool. Real power move.
I'll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.
If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?
But the rattler's so scary.
That can't be right.
[whispers] Yes.
No, he���s good.
[Takes here gift out of her bowl] Oh. What are these?
...and a big walk-in closet.
Yeah, sign says 'Begin tour here.'
She's real good.
Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.
No, I think they mean more like a politician.
One more, one more! [cheers and applause]
Okay.
Come on, Bob.  Raise your hand. [Bob does so reluctantly]
It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again.
[sigh] What are you making?
We���re all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didn't have enough time for them?
I don't get it.
Pam.
Are you all packed?
What's the case, Toby?
Hey!
You guys are together?
She's out of your league Andy.
Uh, on or off?
Yeah.
[as everyone returns to the office] Ah, geez. My nails aren't dry yet. I don't think I can work for at least a couple hours.
[raises hand] Hey, Michael. I mean Jim.
It's the only gavel I could find.
Okay.
[also to Darryl] Good morning.
Um-hmmm.
Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't...
Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.
Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.
[quietly, to Andy] Put your hand up, Norma Rae.
I like your frames.
Oh no, they're still not done.
Mm.
Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.
Oh, boy... You...
You're kidding...
[gasps] What does it say?
Oh, ok. [Phyllis signs for the package, opens an empty box]
Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California?
Ohhh...
Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---
When I say it out loud it's so silly. [they both laugh]
It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
I'm excited about today. [whispers] I love girl talk.
It sure looked good on the mannequin.
Holy crap.
No Bob, we worked it out.
Oh.
Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?
Stanley, you're dancing!
I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it?
That's what I said. He was spying in the ladies' room.
Mmm-hmm.
Open the door, Jim.
An asset!
Ass.
Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay.  Everything else goes in the drawer.
Don���t you have any sunblock?
Cake.
Well, thanks.  I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.
That's awful.
What do you mean?
You don't have to kiss his ass anymore.
Know what?
What's going on?
We're in the same High School class.
Oh, I don't think you're being silly.
Kevin, take your shoes off first!
What? [everyone is confused]
Told you so.
I thought you said green was whorish.
Damn.
You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary.  [sighs] No offense, Jim.  I think she's very pretty.
I hope he's ok, I feel bad.
Please Michael.
It's labeled.
It's, it's fine.
Michael, Michael.
Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer.
There was no client.  Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car.  I had to walk home with no money and no phone.
[laughing] It's good!
I think he-
I'm in too.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I gave you a penguin.
You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...
Sir, you have some messages.
Jim was supposed to collect it.
I do.
But it's closer to you.
You don't even know what I'm talking about.
Afghani.
It'll be all right.
Did you get any clients back?
Four.
Mm-hmm.
[raises hand] Here.
Now this is getting ridiculous.
Disgusting...
He was looking at me in the ladies' room.
It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
That's the character's name?
Did you plan it?
I think it's gonna be Michael.
...report you to HR.
Eight Cases, bright white inkjet.
She does have very nice clothes.
Ass.
Maybe Florida.
It's really something.
Ryan, hand the phone over.
Who?
And this brings us to you, little one.
[dressed as Raggedy Ann] Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?
Yeah mostly.
[to customer] Can you help me?
Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person.
She just crossed her arms together... that's bad.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. [laughs]
I don't need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone.
It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was.
I almost quit my job so I could be closer to Bob, and we're in the same building.
[leaving the room] Excuse me.
Good luck!
Well--
Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck.
I know. I thought you two were nice together.
OK. Packer can go to hell.
But you don't know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
Wow. Sounds scary.
How do you know it's a gun?
I'm getting married to Bob Vance.
Oh.
We don���t work for you!
Lots of things are cozy in the rain.
Yeah.
Why are you here, Todd?
[laughs] Yeah.
I'm sorry,
I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.
Well, there's green, um, blue... yellow... red...
I was...
Yeah. Yeah. Oh.
Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes. [Angela and Pam look uncomfortable]
You tell me.  Well, you do mean you and Jim right?  Oh God.  I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and you're talking all the time.  I'm sorry!
Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.
What--
You're welcome.
Andy!
Let me get you some water.
Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?
Back!
I'm gonna go call Bob.
Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.
How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?
Hey, I hear Jim's coming back.
[sobbing] No.
What does that mean?
You shot Dwight?
Wow, thirteen!
I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.
Andy.
Thank you, Dwight. These are nice.
Sorry. Plastered.
I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?
Got it.
I was just getting a snack.
He's talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy.
It���s just the wind.
Really? I thought they were pretty...
It's the lining of the stomach of--
I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.
Go get him Bobby!
Did you even try?
Michael, you always said we were a family.  Then you went after us.
Who was Pam's first celebrity crush?
Ms. Thomas, so good to see you.
Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here.
Oh. Someplace with a pool, then?
Yeah, I���m not ready for this.
Oh, boy...
Where would you like the Rice Krispy Treat stars?
It's just me here.
I can't feel my toes.
No we���re not.
Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest?
You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.
Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high. [gets out of elevator; hears moans and heavy breathing coming from office; opens door and sees Dwight and Angela making out]
Ooh. Isn't that the one where the guy becomes limitless?
Yeah, that sounds right.
No. Call Bob.
Andy, I���ve been worried about you. How are you?
Oh, the plants are gonna love this.
I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y.
Which thing?
It's a big order. Thanks Kenny.
Yeah, I like Oscar.
Shut up. You're a freak!
No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day. [smiles]
Michael, why would we all go to the dump?
Call us when you get there so we know you're OK. [Andy gets up and leaves]
Thanks guys.
Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you.
I know, Kevin.
Wanna dance, Dwight?
Well, we'll deal with it as it comes.
Uh...
Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars.
Yeah, that���s all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?
Dwight, you can���t go. You have a problem with women. You can���t sell to them.
Hey.
Put it down
So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?
So he won't get caught!
Do you have a black eye?
Someone needs to clean it.  It smells like popcorn.
[to Kelly] Who's that?
Why should I have to thank him?
[singing] Here I go again on my own.  Going down the only road I've ever known...
Hey, you two having fun?
You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know.
When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?
So, uh, show us how you���d normally sell to a female client.
Call a doctor.
You're making a knife with a knife?
[Pam walks out of the bathroom wearing her new red shirt] Woooooow.
Oh, I have a flush!
I invited someone to the party. Bob Vance. He works at Vance Refrigeration next door. That's how we met. [whispers] He's my boyfriend.
Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.
That's right. Yeah.
Let me help you us.
I���ll try this one.
Yeah you have this sexy glow.
That's funny.  Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it. [glares at Stanley's date]
You got dumped?
No way.
Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned.
Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
Come on Andy, they're a good match.
They're important.
I don't know, they're both handsome.
Can I get a list of your vendors?
Does he die?
Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?
Guys, we can���t let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back.
Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client.
Ok... nice.
Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?
Really, Oh, they're from Bob again.
We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.
Cookies?
You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK?  [in character] I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.
Yeah, what's the reason?
Okay, fine. Cash it is.
No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
[in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes?
[on the phone] You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen.
Good. Good.
[on phone] Well, who can do a party of this size?  But you're in the business, you must surely know of some other businesses.  Okay, well, I JUST WANT A DAMN DANCE FLOOR!  Sorry. So sorry, I shouldn't have sworn, I'm so sorry.  Um, thanks for your time. [knock on door]  What?  Sorry, I shouldn't have said 'what' like that, it was really rude.
We already said no.
How's your hearing?
Why wouldn't she?
Hi.
We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while.
Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money.
Definitely Jim.
Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
Then how is this 'Amazing Race'?
Where are we going this afternoon?
Dwight said it's 'Hog maw.'
[holds up mittens she's knitting] Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.
[out of breath] Bowling.
Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke.
Yeah that was a surprise...
I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that...
We-- we--
But I won't be able to do inventory without it.
During our honeymoon safari in Africa, Bob and I were driving late at night, and he'd been drinking, and suddenly thump.  We hit something with our jeep.  It was probably a man.  We didn't know what to do.  We heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us, so we just kept driving as fast as we could.  We bribed the airline, got on a plane that night, and fled home.  Maybe it was just an ostrich.  In a soccer uniform.
Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.
Oh, I know I'd be more productive.
David Wallace called this meeting?
You don't even like us as friends?
But I didn't report your snoring-
Goodnight Pam. [Leaves with oversized bear on back.]
[chuckling] Who takes a kid to Mexico?
Ooh, why is it shaped like that?
Yeah, who wrote it?
Do you think they'll get the account. [Stanley stares at her] How come you never answer me?
But where would we...go?
You've got no taste Stanley Hudson.
Do you have any idea what time we'll get out of here?
Where are we going?
Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can���t just press a magic button.
Yeah. Poor Angela.
I love their breadsticks!
No, it's lettuce.
Clark!
What does the furnace do?
It's really cute.
And I imagine things are starting to heat up?
I'm telling Michael.
Never mind, I shouldn't have said that.
Just go.
Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw.  So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this. [whispering] So we're gonna try out some new things today.
Sic him!
I think you're remembering that wrong?
They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
And it didn't change your mind.
Oh, well, I'm already married.  Boys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses.
Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please? [Erin moves Oscar out of the way for Phyllis]
I think he left.
[to Angela] So this is...
[moans in pain]
I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I...
What?
[Dwight's footsteps sound from the ceiling] Just drive away. Just..
It's not like you can fire people or anything.
[storms in the office, sweaty and out of breath] Are you insane?!
Okay. [opens door] It���s just the wind, see? Nothing.
I don't have that, Dwight.
I don't know, I'm not used to the stress.
Hey!
Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X?
No, just go home.
Hillary Swank.
I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it. [she awkwardly hugs Jim] It's been a long journey... but [sniffles] I'm Santa Claus!
Was there a fistfight?
Val.
C���mon, just say you saw the list by accident.
Mmm, this won't help him, it's a muffin, not cake.
Ryan.
The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing.
Not according to the beans.
Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud.
Okay.
Hi sweetie.
I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't.
C.C
What are you asking?
The guy who sits behind me and the guy who sits across from me are fighting to see who becomes my boss. [laughs]
That's not a good idea, Michael.
When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.
No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat.
The three of us have all been chairmen before.
For your signature. [drops document on Michael's desk]
Robert's house is, well....I don't mean to sound offensive, but it's like where a basketball player would live.
Michael, you make fun of us every day.
Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.
20 cartons of it's coming, on it's way.
Afghani.
It's not me, either.
Yeah.
Wait, what?
Teri's out of town, Michael.
Oh dear.
OK.
I'm out too.
I do.
[Gasps] Oh my god!
Yes.
I thought maybe DJ's.
Wait. This says ���Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge���?
You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder.
Do you have a pole?
Is that ladle stainless or...
Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. It���s hopeless.
Yeah.
You should, you should put out salt for the rims [referring to margaritas]
Hello Angela.
Hey, this is your apology letter.
Did the police solve the problem with the...
I don't think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
What the hell?!
Ow! Ee! I sat on my sandwich.
Are you glad to be back?
Sorry, Michael, I don't think they're real.
Um, The DaVinci Code.
Tom?  He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. [blank stares] Tom? [acts like she's shooting herself in the head] Pow.
We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.
Oh, you say that every time.
Cold, huh?
Thanks Angela.
I don���t think I should walk anymore.  You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast.  Two poached eggs.  And then half a sandwich on the bus.
Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it?
Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It���s all garbage okay? You���re the woman, I���m the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.
Wait, they have food there?
Oh, that's the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties.
I���m happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
No, hey, Dwight shouldn���t...
You don���t have to thank us for coming in, it���s our job.
Mm-hmm.
You mean the clients you stole from us.
That's...
Yeah, I really like Stanley, but I'm not always sure if he likes me. I guess that's okay, 'cause I don't really like him.
He does have a moustache.
Michael, what happened?
I think it's a fun idea.
Dwight, get out of here!
What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.
You're gonna compete against us?
Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain.
Oh, really good, I went to Portugal.
I think I just got flashed.
I actually sleep better when it's raining.
Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things.
Yeah, I lost my client.
I would like to toast to the good fortune I've been having lately...
Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy.
Andy, don���t make us sell this stupid thing.
So is it an open relationship?
What does that even mean?
Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one.
Yeah.
That's despicable.
Mistake.
But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out.
Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that���s Italian.
[at Michael return to Jim's office] Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!
Play it again.
It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
What does that even mean?
Oh, sorry, it's your job.
Really?
Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?
Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five.
A lot of mines in Scranton.
[grabs phone] Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle?
[hugging Andy]. Andy���
Yes, I'm jumping.
Say 'Me eat cookie.'
Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.
What smell?
Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.
Order carrot cake. [laughter]
It is so nice to go out with another couple.
Andy's running over Dwight with his car.
He should pay.
I don't care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise.
We���re gonna cover for you, ya know.
Oh, I like Olive Garden.
Yes.
Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme.
[whispering to Angela] I don't like you.
I need you to get rid of the tree.
Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy.
So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ?
I'll see what I can find out.
Poor, poor Andy.
Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too.
You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality.
