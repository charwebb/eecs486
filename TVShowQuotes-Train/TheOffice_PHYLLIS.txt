Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures?
I invited someone to the party. Bob Vance. He works at Vance Refrigeration next door. That's how we met. [whispers] He's my boyfriend.
For your signature. [drops document on Michael's desk]
You left me in a bad part of town!
I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.
I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works.
Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.
I couldn't see your hands. [Jim shakes his hands] Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK?
Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck.
Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela's having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.
It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good!
Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I'm on.
Okay... [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
You're arrogant and pompous, and I don't like you.
It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy.'
Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up.
Do you think they'll get the account. [Stanley stares at her] How come you never answer me?
I can't be around sad people, it makes me sad.
This is ridiculous.  We just can't wait here.
I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down  she wouldn't be a good wife.
But I won't be able to do inventory without it.
I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs.
Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts. [Michael stares at her incredulously] But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads.
I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today.  I'm really happy being here.
Oh, I���m gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.
Michael... [Kelly enters conference room in a flirty red dress]
What were you doing in the ladies room?!
No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.
[on phone] I know, I know.  We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.
Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen]
Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her ���gy-na��� for your entire meeting.
I don't care what she's doing.  I just hope she keeps doing it.
Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.
Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that���s Italian.
Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?
Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.
[on the phone] You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
What's gonna make you feel better, big guy?
Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What?
You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?
Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.
Yeah, I really like Stanley, but I'm not always sure if he likes me. I guess that's okay, 'cause I don't really like him.
You don't even know what I'm talking about.
How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?
The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing.
Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he���s gone for who knows how long.
Oh, that's the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties.
I think Jim would be a good boss. Plus he's eye candy. It's OK, Bob... Vance knows he's on my list. Um, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jim, and that British guy that got in trouble with a prostitute.
Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars.
Oh, I don't think it's blackmail.  Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight.  I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.
Yes, I got those cute little ones. [Angela looks at her disapprovingly] Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?
I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.
Robert's house is, well....I don't mean to sound offensive, but it's like where a basketball player would live.
It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning!
First message is: 'I love you'.  That's from me.
I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.
[holds up mittens she's knitting] Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.
Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out.
This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood!
Mmm... sometimes her stockings have a run in them.
We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.
Tom?  He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. [blank stares] Tom? [acts like she's shooting herself in the head] Pow.
We���re all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?
We're laughing at this cartoon! [passes newspaper to Dwight]
Look, I don���t feel safe. I think we should call the police.
So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.
Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it.
Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five.
If you're just handing them out, I want one too.
I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.
As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.
Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand.
[Micheal dressed as Phyllis, pretending to knit] Well, what are you talking about? [cracking noise] Ohh! Ohh! [falls onto the ground] I've fallen and I can't get up!
All right sweetie, I'll tell her its Michael.
Close your mouth, sweetie.  You look like a trout.
No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.
I almost quit my job so I could be closer to Bob, and we're in the same building.
Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too.
[at Michael return to Jim's office] Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. [laughs]
It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?
Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients.
I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her.
So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?
[grabs phone] Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle?
Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy.
Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out.
So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?
I'm sorry.  It's the largest one I have.
You promised me this. Don't make me get Bob involved!
Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.
An Xbox it is. Because I've decided you're a good boy.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I gave you a penguin.
[Balls up post-its and throws them in Angela's face]
I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it. [she awkwardly hugs Jim] It's been a long journey... but [sniffles] I'm Santa Claus!
The guy who sits behind me and the guy who sits across from me are fighting to see who becomes my boss. [laughs]
I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't.
Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob.
Are you gonna give me the leads or not?
Why couldn't have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?
[Pam walks out of the bathroom wearing her new red shirt] Woooooow.
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus!
When I was growing up, my mom said, 'the sky's the limit.'  I could do anything.  Be a teacher's aide, nurse's assistant, some kind of volunteer.  But now, I, I'm not so sure.
Yeah, Dwight's right we should drop a bomb.
Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby.  Sheet cake.
Ooh. Isn't that the one where the guy becomes limitless?
If my daughter were asking me... [both giggle]
And if the food stations are here and here... no!  Here and here.  Drinks here, then people can mingle.  But then where would the band go?
I have a new swimsuit I need to break in....
Andy sings beautifully. And he���s really good at dancing. He���s a good speaker. But there���s just something there you don���t want to look at.
I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I...
Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.
Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It���s all garbage okay? You���re the woman, I���m the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.
Do you have any idea what time we'll get out of here?
Can I get a list of your vendors?
Angela, you'll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it's the generic one. It's Stanley's favorite.
But you don't know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud.
You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why aren't you wearing the hairnet?
It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that...
The three of us have all been chairmen before.
It's times like these, I wish my mother were with me right now.  She'd show me what to do.  That's stupid; she's not here.  [looks at watch] She's at water aerobics for the next forty-five minutes.
He was looking at me in the ladies' room.
Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.
Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin's hair with her hand]
Oh sure, a little piece.  Ooh, no mushroom though.
Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy.
No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat.
Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.
I don't think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you -
Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far.
Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. [Michael laughs]
No. [trying to finish her sale when Michael hangs up the phone] I'm on a sale!
That's a shame.  Ed was a good guy.
I don���t think I should walk anymore.  You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast.  Two poached eggs.  And then half a sandwich on the bus.
I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind.
You don't have to kiss his ass anymore.
And when you fell in, did you flounder?
What's the least we can do to make this okay?
[laughing] Yeah, we really did peel your grapes.
Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt.  You should be apologizing to us.
Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
Oh, are those your kids? They���re so cute! They could be models.
Oh I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held.
You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK?  [in character] I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.
Yeah, the Syracuse branch can���t be happy you���re taking New York clients.
You mean the clients you stole from us.
Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please? [Erin moves Oscar out of the way for Phyllis]
It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering.
Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em.
So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ?
It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was.
Aw, what the hell? [goes to Vance Refrigeration] Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?
You must have misdialed. This is Phyllis. No, I'm not sure what his extension is. [glares at Stanley as he glares right back]
Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside.
We have a gym at home. It���s called the bedroom.
[seeing a large red spot on Michael's lip] God! Wow!
Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.
You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder.
Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry.
You can pick one of these things.  It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.
[singing] Here I go again on my own.  Going down the only road I've ever known...
Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done. [laughs]
Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain.
Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.
Call us when you get there so we know you're OK. [Andy gets up and leaves]
Guys, we can���t let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back.
Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
Haven't you been following the news? Ther university is using its non-profit status to fund its private real estate investments.
Come on, Dwight, I think it's actually healthy to get it off your chest.
Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]
Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.
We know the branch is closing; Michael told us.
I'm glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he's stupid.
I'm excited about today. [whispers] I love girl talk.
Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it?
If I wanted Jamaican food I'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.
Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.
Michael, you always said we were a family.  Then you went after us.
[gasps] Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She's doing a book signing right now.
Dwight was in the ladies' room and he was looking at me.
Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene.
Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?
You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.
Where did you save the list of exchanges?
Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.
Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here.
Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can���t just press a magic button.
Dwight! [Dwight pulls out a hunting knife and jumps off desk]
Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play.
I need you to get rid of the tree.
[on phone] Well, who can do a party of this size?  But you're in the business, you must surely know of some other businesses.  Okay, well, I JUST WANT A DAMN DANCE FLOOR!  Sorry. So sorry, I shouldn't have sworn, I'm so sorry.  Um, thanks for your time. [knock on door]  What?  Sorry, I shouldn't have said 'what' like that, it was really rude.
Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. [Kevin nods] Okay.
It is so nice to go out with another couple.
It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.
Come on, Bob.  Raise your hand. [Bob does so reluctantly]
You know what? I don���t know where the years went. �����Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don���t even recognize them.
What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.
You don���t have to thank us for coming in, it���s our job.
I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go?
Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you.
When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.
I would like to toast to the good fortune I've been having lately...
I know. I thought you two were nice together.
Oh, ok. [Phyllis signs for the package, opens an empty box]
When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?
Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high. [gets out of elevator; hears moans and heavy breathing coming from office; opens door and sees Dwight and Angela making out]
You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality.
Write him up or I'll take it to Jan.
Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?
Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.
You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary.  [sighs] No offense, Jim.  I think she's very pretty.
Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He���s not terrible.
Michael, why would we all go to the dump?
It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone.  Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.
It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.
I, uh, I met a man and I'm totally in love, and that's a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts...
Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didn't have enough time for them?
Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme.
Okay. [opens door] It���s just the wind, see? Nothing.
I know Sue. She's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheelchair, right?
If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?
Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?
Hit it, red! [���Boogie Wonderland��� by Earth Wind & Fire plays as Darryl dances with each member of the office]
Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest?
Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?
He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.
Or the mini mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. You can get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your [to Nellie] boyfriend. But, I mean, if you don't have one of those you can probably just bring whoever it is you use to kill your loneliness.
It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
Did the police solve the problem with the...
Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.
I didn't ask you where it was.  I told you where it needs to be.
Dwight, you can���t go. You have a problem with women. You can���t sell to them.
Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. It���s hopeless.
What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
No, I think they mean more like a politician.
I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.
I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense. But, they're also really fluffy.
They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
So, uh, show us how you���d normally sell to a female client.
Jim, don't listen to Andy.  I think it's so romantic.
Oh, we find little times during the day.
Michael. You know, when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?
I don't know, I'm not used to the stress.
No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
[under her breath] There's another party in the break room.
Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You've been very good this year -
Of course you don't wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn't even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical.
Maybe that'll help. Is it cold in there?
We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while.
You could put your cell phone in it instead.
I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.
We think you made a big, big mistake.
Yeah, that���s all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?
Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California?
This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!
Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.
Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things.
In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let's put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle's eye! Let the party begin! [Dwight plugs in tree lights, office applauds.]
Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping.
Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!
Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?
Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading.
Michael, you make fun of us every day.
You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.
Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.
I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up shot glass] I don't think they're appropriate anymore.
Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again.
The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?
Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?
Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes. [Angela and Pam look uncomfortable]
Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.
I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee.  I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine.
Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley.
[to Stanley] Hey! Good to have you back.
You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it.
That's funny.  Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it. [glares at Stanley's date]
Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it?
So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?
Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson���s a mean old grump. [laughs] But [crying] would a grump make this? It���s me. It���s me.
Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl.
Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?
We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.
I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?
[Takes here gift out of her bowl] Oh. What are these?
I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.
I���m happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person.
[as everyone returns to the office] Ah, geez. My nails aren't dry yet. I don't think I can work for at least a couple hours.
Oh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't.
[Phyllis, Pam, Toby, and Oscar are sharing iPod headphones] I don't understand.  Which one is that?
What do we do? How do we stop this?
Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?
Oh! When you got your new phone, that's when you asked for everyone's attention.
Hey, Andy!  Maybe this is one of those situations where you just have to do her to get her out of your system.
Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested.
Well, we'll deal with it as it comes.
It's not gonna get better; he's gonna steal all of our clients.
Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people.
Goodnight Pam. [Leaves with oversized bear on back.]
He and Pam are having their Valentine's Day lunch.
I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.
Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw.  So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this. [whispering] So we're gonna try out some new things today.
Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.
We-we found some wet cement in the park...
I wonder what people like about me? ... Probably my jugs.
No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.
20 cartons of it's coming, on it's way.
[Dwight's footsteps sound from the ceiling] Just drive away. Just..
It's not like you can fire people or anything.
After 16 years, it���s strange sitting across from somebody who isn���t Stanley. But���he���ll get there.
Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... it's stupid, forget it.
During our honeymoon safari in Africa, Bob and I were driving late at night, and he'd been drinking, and suddenly thump.  We hit something with our jeep.  It was probably a man.  We didn't know what to do.  We heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us, so we just kept driving as fast as we could.  We bribed the airline, got on a plane that night, and fled home.  Maybe it was just an ostrich.  In a soccer uniform.
Oh, well, I'm already married.  Boys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses.
I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle]
[whispering] Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?
One time I said good morning to her, and she didn't say it back.
I'm good baby. [they kiss, both dressed as Santa]
Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it.
How is that possible?  No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?
Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for.
Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?
Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?
I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.
No, you knew me in high school.  Course, we all thought you were gay in high school.
Michael, just give us our clients back.  That's all we care about.
I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school.
When I say it out loud it's so silly. [they both laugh]
That's a halwa shabkia cookie.  They serve it during Ramadan. [Angela spits her cookie out]
I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.
Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.
I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.
Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client.
Well, Andy���s cute, but he���s too vanilla, whereas Pete - he���s just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird.
We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.
Where would you like the Rice Krispy Treat stars?
I don't care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise.
Yeah, thank you. [As Phyllis enjoys Bob's meat, Jim and Pam look knowingly into the camera]
Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?
No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day. [smiles]
So, we're all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes?
Mm. I like your shoes. [Kelly has 5-inch heels on]
Sort of. He had a lot of clients.
Hi Michael. [Michael sits on her lap] Mm. 'kay.
If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four.
And this brings us to you, little one.
Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---
[to Ernesto] I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?
We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen.
Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.
Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one.
You should, you should put out salt for the rims [referring to margaritas]
Whose hands are these? [holding out her hands to Jim] Theyre not my hands. I don���t know.
Andy, I���ve been worried about you. How are you?
That's what I said. He was spying in the ladies' room.
Well, Bob was going to just drive me.
Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.
Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.
Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know.
Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So...  [Jim gestures for her to continue]
[notices Andy boxing up things from Erin's desk] What are you doing?
[in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes?
What in the name of God is going on?!
Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?
You know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess.
Someone needs to clean it.  It smells like popcorn.
Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money.
Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.
Lots of things are cozy in the rain.
You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know.
I was all-county my junior and senior years.
It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.
You are my little teddy bear. I wantcha.
You can pay me back later for the makeover.
I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
