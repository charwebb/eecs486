Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far.
I don't care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise.
Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?
You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.
You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder.
Come on, Dwight, I think it's actually healthy to get it off your chest.
Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?
Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke.
[dressed as Raggedy Ann] Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?
Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.
Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby.  Sheet cake.
So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?
An Xbox it is. Because I've decided you're a good boy.
Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't...
You mean the clients you stole from us.
Michael, you always said we were a family.  Then you went after us.
[Takes here gift out of her bowl] Oh. What are these?
That's what I said. He was spying in the ladies' room.
The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing.
I'm excited about today. [whispers] I love girl talk.
It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone.  Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.
No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.
Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?
Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes. [Angela and Pam look uncomfortable]
No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day. [smiles]
Write him up or I'll take it to Jan.
What do we do? How do we stop this?
Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He���s not terrible.
Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... it's stupid, forget it.
Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for.
You are my little teddy bear. I wantcha.
In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let's put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle's eye! Let the party begin! [Dwight plugs in tree lights, office applauds.]
Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.
Michael... [Kelly enters conference room in a flirty red dress]
Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out.
Did the police solve the problem with the...
Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.
Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand.
[as everyone returns to the office] Ah, geez. My nails aren't dry yet. I don't think I can work for at least a couple hours.
I can't see half of the things. [adjusts glasses]
Yeah, I really like Stanley, but I'm not always sure if he likes me. I guess that's okay, 'cause I don't really like him.
Maybe that'll help. Is it cold in there?
Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What?
Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.
What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
Andy, I���ve been worried about you. How are you?
I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't.
He was looking at me in the ladies' room.
Well, thanks.  I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.
He asked if you've been acting withdrawn lately.
You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why aren't you wearing the hairnet?
I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that.
Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures?
It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good!
Mmm, this won't help him, it's a muffin, not cake.
I'm glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he's stupid.
Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up.
I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y.
[to Ernesto] I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?
Oh, I'm sorry.  I gave you a penguin.
How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?
Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.
I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind.
We think you made a big, big mistake.
Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley.
I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle]
No. [trying to finish her sale when Michael hangs up the phone] I'm on a sale!
[seeing a large red spot on Michael's lip] God! Wow!
Where would you like the Rice Krispy Treat stars?
I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go?
You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.
Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can���t just press a magic button.
Do you think they'll get the account. [Stanley stares at her] How come you never answer me?
Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you.
Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done. [laughs]
Do you have any idea what time we'll get out of here?
You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality.
I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that...
You promised me this. Don't make me get Bob involved!
[holds up mittens she's knitting] Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.
When I say it out loud it's so silly. [they both laugh]
[singing] Here I go again on my own.  Going down the only road I've ever known...
I have a new swimsuit I need to break in....
[whispering] Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?
Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.
You must have misdialed. This is Phyllis. No, I'm not sure what his extension is. [glares at Stanley as he glares right back]
If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four.
I couldn't see your hands. [Jim shakes his hands] Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK?
I would like to toast to the good fortune I've been having lately...
Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited.
I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.
We're laughing at this cartoon! [passes newspaper to Dwight]
Yeah, thank you. [As Phyllis enjoys Bob's meat, Jim and Pam look knowingly into the camera]
Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl.
That's funny.  Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it. [glares at Stanley's date]
[crying] Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn't supposed to take no for an answer.
He and Pam are having their Valentine's Day lunch.
Dwight was in the ladies' room and he was looking at me.
But you don't know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it.
If I wanted Jamaican food I'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.
So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ?
[Phyllis, Pam, Toby, and Oscar are sharing iPod headphones] I don't understand.  Which one is that?
Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that���s Italian.
Jim, don't listen to Andy.  I think it's so romantic.
I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today.  I'm really happy being here.
She just crossed her arms together... that's bad.
Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain.
Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading.
Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So...  [Jim gestures for her to continue]
Ooh. Isn't that the one where the guy becomes limitless?
So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you -
Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy.
Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer.
Robert's house is, well....I don't mean to sound offensive, but it's like where a basketball player would live.
[under her breath] There's another party in the break room.
It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was.
[Balls up post-its and throws them in Angela's face]
Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson���s a mean old grump. [laughs] But [crying] would a grump make this? It���s me. It���s me.
Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it.
He's a real catch and you should take him back.
Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.
I'll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.
Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.
What were you doing in the ladies room?!
Someone needs to clean it.  It smells like popcorn.
Michael. You know, when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?
As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.
Dwight, you can���t go. You have a problem with women. You can���t sell to them.
No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.
Oh, that's the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties.
And if the food stations are here and here... no!  Here and here.  Drinks here, then people can mingle.  But then where would the band go?
Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person.
I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down  she wouldn't be a good wife.
I didn't ask you where it was.  I told you where it needs to be.
So, we're all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes?
I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.
This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!
This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood!
I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I...
It is so nice to go out with another couple.
C���mon, just say you saw the list by accident.
I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.
You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK?  [in character] I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.
You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?
You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...
Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?
[groaning while trying to open giant wine bottle] ha ha!
Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.
It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.
So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?
You tell me.  Well, you do mean you and Jim right?  Oh God.  I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and you're talking all the time.  I'm sorry!
What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.
Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts. [Michael stares at her incredulously] But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads.
But I won't be able to do inventory without it.
Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
Well, we'll deal with it as it comes.
Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?
Guys, we can���t let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back.
I'm sorry.  It's the largest one I have.
You know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess.
Michael. [Michael throws Phyllis' keys under the car.]
Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?
Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?
Oh I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held.
I almost quit my job so I could be closer to Bob, and we're in the same building.
Of course you don't wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn't even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical.
Whose hands are these? [holding out her hands to Jim] Theyre not my hands. I don���t know.
Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?
Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em.
I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it?
That's a halwa shabkia cookie.  They serve it during Ramadan. [Angela spits her cookie out]
Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know.
Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?
Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it?
Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.
Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]
It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?
It's not gonna get better; he's gonna steal all of our clients.
Well, Andy���s cute, but he���s too vanilla, whereas Pete - he���s just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird.
Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee.  The theme is 'Nights in Morocco'.  This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party.  Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate.
If you're just handing them out, I want one too.
I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.
Okay. [opens door] It���s just the wind, see? Nothing.
There was no client.  Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car.  I had to walk home with no money and no phone.
What in the name of God is going on?!
Come on, Bob.  Raise your hand. [Bob does so reluctantly]
Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. [Michael laughs]
You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know.
Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?
Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.
We know the branch is closing; Michael told us.
Hey, Andy!  Maybe this is one of those situations where you just have to do her to get her out of your system.
It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.
It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
Aw, what the hell? [goes to Vance Refrigeration] Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?
Yes, I got those cute little ones. [Angela looks at her disapprovingly] Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?
You know what? I don���t know where the years went. �����Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don���t even recognize them.
I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs.
Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy.
[storms in the office, sweaty and out of breath] Are you insane?!
Yeah, that���s all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?
Hi Michael. [Michael sits on her lap] Mm. 'kay.
When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?
Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.
During our honeymoon safari in Africa, Bob and I were driving late at night, and he'd been drinking, and suddenly thump.  We hit something with our jeep.  It was probably a man.  We didn't know what to do.  We heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us, so we just kept driving as fast as we could.  We bribed the airline, got on a plane that night, and fled home.  Maybe it was just an ostrich.  In a soccer uniform.
Oh, I���m gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.
Or the mini mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. You can get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your [to Nellie] boyfriend. But, I mean, if you don't have one of those you can probably just bring whoever it is you use to kill your loneliness.
Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!
I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense. But, they're also really fluffy.
Oh, I don't think it's blackmail.  Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight.  I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.
We���re all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
Sort of. He had a lot of clients.
Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X?
[quietly, to Andy] Put your hand up, Norma Rae.
Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.
When I was growing up, my mom said, 'the sky's the limit.'  I could do anything.  Be a teacher's aide, nurse's assistant, some kind of volunteer.  But now, I, I'm not so sure.
When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.
Are you gonna give me the leads or not?
I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too.
You're arrogant and pompous, and I don't like you.
Okay... [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it?
Hit it, red! [���Boogie Wonderland��� by Earth Wind & Fire plays as Darryl dances with each member of the office]
[Micheal dressed as Phyllis, pretending to knit] Well, what are you talking about? [cracking noise] Ohh! Ohh! [falls onto the ground] I've fallen and I can't get up!
I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.
If my daughter were asking me... [both giggle]
No, I think they mean more like a politician.
I can't be around sad people, it makes me sad.
Close your mouth, sweetie.  You look like a trout.
Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen]
Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.
I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee.  I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine.
What's gonna make you feel better, big guy?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.
Yeah, Dwight's right we should drop a bomb.
[grabs phone] Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle?
Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California?
I need you to get rid of the tree.
Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he���s gone for who knows how long.
They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?
You left me in a bad part of town!
Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela's having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.
Oh, are those your kids? They���re so cute! They could be models.
Well, Bob was going to just drive me.
You can pick one of these things.  It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.
[Pam walks out of the bathroom wearing her new red shirt] Woooooow.
The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?
Mm. I like your shoes. [Kelly has 5-inch heels on]
I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.
Look, I don���t feel safe. I think we should call the police.
I, uh, I met a man and I'm totally in love, and that's a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts...
Can I get a list of your vendors?
I invited someone to the party. Bob Vance. He works at Vance Refrigeration next door. That's how we met. [whispers] He's my boyfriend.
Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud.
You don���t have to thank us for coming in, it���s our job.
[notices Andy boxing up things from Erin's desk] What are you doing?
We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.
Goodnight Pam. [Leaves with oversized bear on back.]
Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?
Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry.
You should, you should put out salt for the rims [referring to margaritas]
Why couldn't have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?
Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly...
Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients.
[hands Jim folder] Ask for Donald, Karen���s bananas.
You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.
I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.
The guy who sits behind me and the guy who sits across from me are fighting to see who becomes my boss. [laughs]
Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her ���gy-na��� for your entire meeting.
So, uh, show us how you���d normally sell to a female client.
[on phone] Well, who can do a party of this size?  But you're in the business, you must surely know of some other businesses.  Okay, well, I JUST WANT A DAMN DANCE FLOOR!  Sorry. So sorry, I shouldn't have sworn, I'm so sorry.  Um, thanks for your time. [knock on door]  What?  Sorry, I shouldn't have said 'what' like that, it was really rude.
Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested.
[at Michael return to Jim's office] Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!
I was all-county my junior and senior years.
We-we found some wet cement in the park...
Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw.  So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this. [whispering] So we're gonna try out some new things today.
I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it. [she awkwardly hugs Jim] It's been a long journey... but [sniffles] I'm Santa Claus!
No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus!
Oh, ok. [Phyllis signs for the package, opens an empty box]
Lots of things are cozy in the rain.
Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five.
I wonder what people like about me? ... Probably my jugs.
Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. [footage of Dwight and Angela making out] I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.
[gasps] Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She's doing a book signing right now.
Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay.  Everything else goes in the drawer.
I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.
We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while.
It's not like you can fire people or anything.
That's a shame.  Ed was a good guy.
Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.
Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob.
I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.
Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me?  We'll take all afternoon. [whispering] Michael is terrified of bob.
Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?
Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money.
I know. I thought you two were nice together.
You can pay me back later for the makeover.
It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
Oh! When you got your new phone, that's when you asked for everyone's attention.
My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you?
[on phone] I know, I know.  We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.
This is ridiculous.  We just can't wait here.
How is that possible?  No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?
It's times like these, I wish my mother were with me right now.  She'd show me what to do.  That's stupid; she's not here.  [looks at watch] She's at water aerobics for the next forty-five minutes.
I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works.
You could put your cell phone in it instead.
We have a gym at home. It���s called the bedroom.
Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. It���s hopeless.
Michael, just give us our clients back.  That's all we care about.
An hour? I can't stay here an hour.
Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt.  You should be apologizing to us.
Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---
Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?
I know Sue. She's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheelchair, right?
I'm good baby. [they kiss, both dressed as Santa]
No, you knew me in high school.  Course, we all thought you were gay in high school.
[laughing] Yeah, we really did peel your grapes.
Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?
I don't need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone.
Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again.
And this brings us to you, little one.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. [laughs]
Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It���s all garbage okay? You���re the woman, I���m the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.
Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.
Tom?  He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. [blank stares] Tom? [acts like she's shooting herself in the head] Pow.
Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars.
Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
After 16 years, it���s strange sitting across from somebody who isn���t Stanley. But���he���ll get there.
Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client.
I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her.
Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people.
Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck.
You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary.  [sighs] No offense, Jim.  I think she's very pretty.
Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one.
Andy sings beautifully. And he���s really good at dancing. He���s a good speaker. But there���s just something there you don���t want to look at.
I think Jim would be a good boss. Plus he's eye candy. It's OK, Bob... Vance knows he's on my list. Um, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jim, and that British guy that got in trouble with a prostitute.
Michael, you make fun of us every day.
Haven't you been following the news? Ther university is using its non-profit status to fund its private real estate investments.
You don't have to kiss his ass anymore.
And when you fell in, did you flounder?
Oh sure, a little piece.  Ooh, no mushroom though.
Oh, we find little times during the day.
Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.
Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering.
Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.
I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.
Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out.
20 cartons of it's coming, on it's way.
It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning!
Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside.
First message is: 'I love you'.  That's from me.
Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high. [gets out of elevator; hears moans and heavy breathing coming from office; opens door and sees Dwight and Angela making out]
Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.
You don't even know what I'm talking about.
I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
Yeah, the Syracuse branch can���t be happy you���re taking New York clients.
I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.
[to Stanley] Hey! Good to have you back.
No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat.
[in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes?
Dwight! [Dwight pulls out a hunting knife and jumps off desk]
Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.
One time I said good morning to her, and she didn't say it back.
So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.
Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme.
I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
Mmm... sometimes her stockings have a run in them.
If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?
Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene.
For your signature. [drops document on Michael's desk]
I���m happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here.
No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.
Angela, you'll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it's the generic one. It's Stanley's favorite.
Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk.
We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen.
