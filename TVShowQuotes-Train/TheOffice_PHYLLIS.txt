Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me?  We'll take all afternoon. [whispering] Michael is terrified of bob.
Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen]
As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.
I almost quit my job so I could be closer to Bob, and we're in the same building.
You could put your cell phone in it instead.
They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay.  Everything else goes in the drawer.
[under her breath] There's another party in the break room.
We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen.
It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
It is so nice to go out with another couple.
Guys, we can���t let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back.
I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.
What were you doing in the ladies room?!
I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today.  I'm really happy being here.
[Micheal dressed as Phyllis, pretending to knit] Well, what are you talking about? [cracking noise] Ohh! Ohh! [falls onto the ground] I've fallen and I can't get up!
Whose hands are these? [holding out her hands to Jim] Theyre not my hands. I don���t know.
Haven't you been following the news? Ther university is using its non-profit status to fund its private real estate investments.
[Phyllis, Pam, Toby, and Oscar are sharing iPod headphones] I don't understand.  Which one is that?
And I imagine things are starting to heat up?
Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.
I know. I thought you two were nice together.
You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why aren't you wearing the hairnet?
Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene.
Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested.
Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.
Oh, well, I'm already married.  Boys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses.
Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her ���gy-na��� for your entire meeting.
I'm good baby. [they kiss, both dressed as Santa]
If I wanted Jamaican food I'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.
Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it.
I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.
Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high. [gets out of elevator; hears moans and heavy breathing coming from office; opens door and sees Dwight and Angela making out]
This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee.  The theme is 'Nights in Morocco'.  This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party.  Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate.
One time I said good morning to her, and she didn't say it back.
I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense. But, they're also really fluffy.
Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. [footage of Dwight and Angela making out] I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.
I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it?
That's what I said. He was spying in the ladies' room.
I don't need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone.
And if the food stations are here and here... no!  Here and here.  Drinks here, then people can mingle.  But then where would the band go?
Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts. [Michael stares at her incredulously] But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads.
Okay. [opens door] It���s just the wind, see? Nothing.
He's a real catch and you should take him back.
Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here.
Oh sure, a little piece.  Ooh, no mushroom though.
The guy who sits behind me and the guy who sits across from me are fighting to see who becomes my boss. [laughs]
This is ridiculous.  We just can't wait here.
Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.
Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you.
Oh, I don't think it's blackmail.  Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight.  I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.
We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.
I���m happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You've been very good this year -
Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So...  [Jim gestures for her to continue]
Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.
Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.
I have an ice cream cake in the car.
All right sweetie, I'll tell her its Michael.
Robert's house is, well....I don't mean to sound offensive, but it's like where a basketball player would live.
What in the name of God is going on?!
[grabs phone] Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle?
You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know.
Or the mini mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. You can get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your [to Nellie] boyfriend. But, I mean, if you don't have one of those you can probably just bring whoever it is you use to kill your loneliness.
Come on, Dwight, I think it's actually healthy to get it off your chest.
You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.
I think Jim would be a good boss. Plus he's eye candy. It's OK, Bob... Vance knows he's on my list. Um, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jim, and that British guy that got in trouble with a prostitute.
So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?
How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?
I need you to get rid of the tree.
Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?
Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.
So, uh, show us how you���d normally sell to a female client.
I know Sue. She's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheelchair, right?
Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud.
[storms in the office, sweaty and out of breath] Are you insane?!
[groaning while trying to open giant wine bottle] ha ha!
He and Pam are having their Valentine's Day lunch.
Write him up or I'll take it to Jan.
I wonder what people like about me? ... Probably my jugs.
Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.
Oh, ok. [Phyllis signs for the package, opens an empty box]
Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out.
I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.
Jim, don't listen to Andy.  I think it's so romantic.
Michael... [Kelly enters conference room in a flirty red dress]
Yeah, the Syracuse branch can���t be happy you���re taking New York clients.
Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl.
Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person.
I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I'm on.
Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping.
I, uh, I met a man and I'm totally in love, and that's a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts...
So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ?
[quietly, to Andy] Put your hand up, Norma Rae.
You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.
Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby.  Sheet cake.
I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.
I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.
You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?
Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play.
Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for.
I couldn't see your hands. [Jim shakes his hands] Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK?
You are my little teddy bear. I wantcha.
It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning!
Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited.
He was looking at me in the ladies' room.
Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people.
Mm. I like your shoes. [Kelly has 5-inch heels on]
I don't know, I'm not used to the stress.
I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y.
What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!
And this brings us to you, little one.
Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?
[as everyone returns to the office] Ah, geez. My nails aren't dry yet. I don't think I can work for at least a couple hours.
Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!
We're laughing at this cartoon! [passes newspaper to Dwight]
Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. [laughs]
You can pick one of these things.  It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.
[Pam walks out of the bathroom wearing her new red shirt] Woooooow.
[notices Andy boxing up things from Erin's desk] What are you doing?
I don't care what she's doing.  I just hope she keeps doing it.
Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.
Maybe that'll help. Is it cold in there?
I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle]
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus!
20 cartons of it's coming, on it's way.
Well, Andy���s cute, but he���s too vanilla, whereas Pete - he���s just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird.
We know the branch is closing; Michael told us.
Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.
Yes, I got those cute little ones. [Angela looks at her disapprovingly] Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?
I don���t think I should walk anymore.  You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast.  Two poached eggs.  And then half a sandwich on the bus.
Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars.
Close your mouth, sweetie.  You look like a trout.
First message is: 'I love you'.  That's from me.
Of course you don't wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn't even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical.
Hit it, red! [���Boogie Wonderland��� by Earth Wind & Fire plays as Darryl dances with each member of the office]
Aw, what the hell? [goes to Vance Refrigeration] Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?
[gasps] Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She's doing a book signing right now.
C���mon, just say you saw the list by accident.
No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day. [smiles]
Ooh. Isn't that the one where the guy becomes limitless?
Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things.
Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes. [Angela and Pam look uncomfortable]
The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?
Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can���t just press a magic button.
Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke.
Yeah, I really like Stanley, but I'm not always sure if he likes me. I guess that's okay, 'cause I don't really like him.
My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you?
How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?
Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.
When I was growing up, my mom said, 'the sky's the limit.'  I could do anything.  Be a teacher's aide, nurse's assistant, some kind of volunteer.  But now, I, I'm not so sure.
Oh, we find little times during the day.
I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs.
You should, you should put out salt for the rims [referring to margaritas]
Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.
That's a halwa shabkia cookie.  They serve it during Ramadan. [Angela spits her cookie out]
I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.
Do you think they'll get the account. [Stanley stares at her] How come you never answer me?
You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...
What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.
Andy sings beautifully. And he���s really good at dancing. He���s a good speaker. But there���s just something there you don���t want to look at.
[hands Jim folder] Ask for Donald, Karen���s bananas.
You know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess.
Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
We-we found some wet cement in the park...
Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---
Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.
Well, thanks.  I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.
It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was.
Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?
Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. [Michael laughs]
Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?
Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. It���s hopeless.
Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.
I invited someone to the party. Bob Vance. He works at Vance Refrigeration next door. That's how we met. [whispers] He's my boyfriend.
Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering.
Lots of things are cozy in the rain.
When I say it out loud it's so silly. [they both laugh]
Do you have any idea what time we'll get out of here?
I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works.
An hour? I can't stay here an hour.
You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality.
I would like to toast to the good fortune I've been having lately...
So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?
Michael. You know, when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?
Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?
Goodnight Pam. [Leaves with oversized bear on back.]
[on phone] I know, I know.  We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.
I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I...
I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.
No, I think they mean more like a politician.
Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money.
It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.
Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that���s Italian.
Dwight was in the ladies' room and he was looking at me.
[Balls up post-its and throws them in Angela's face]
Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson���s a mean old grump. [laughs] But [crying] would a grump make this? It���s me. It���s me.
The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing.
[Takes here gift out of her bowl] Oh. What are these?
[on the phone] You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.
Where did you save the list of exchanges?
What's the least we can do to make this okay?
[singing] Here I go again on my own.  Going down the only road I've ever known...
I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go?
Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?
Someone needs to clean it.  It smells like popcorn.
[laughing] Yeah, we really did peel your grapes.
Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.
Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
[snatches ring] Then another woman will get it. We can't allow that. We have to destroy it.
I didn't ask you where it was.  I told you where it needs to be.
Did the police solve the problem with the...
Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it?
Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again.
Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know.
Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... it's stupid, forget it.
You're arrogant and pompous, and I don't like you.
You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it.
Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley.
Oh! When you got your new phone, that's when you asked for everyone's attention.
But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out.
Yeah, Dwight's right we should drop a bomb.
[at Michael return to Jim's office] Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!
You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder.
Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.
Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw.  So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this. [whispering] So we're gonna try out some new things today.
She just crossed her arms together... that's bad.
Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy.
During our honeymoon safari in Africa, Bob and I were driving late at night, and he'd been drinking, and suddenly thump.  We hit something with our jeep.  It was probably a man.  We didn't know what to do.  We heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us, so we just kept driving as fast as we could.  We bribed the airline, got on a plane that night, and fled home.  Maybe it was just an ostrich.  In a soccer uniform.
Are you gonna give me the leads or not?
I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school.
Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.
I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that.
Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
Yeah, that���s all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?
[crying] Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn't supposed to take no for an answer.
Michael, you make fun of us every day.
The first thing I'd buy is new boobs. For my mom. She has the worst boobs. It- It's embarrassing.
You know what? I don���t know where the years went. �����Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don���t even recognize them.
So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?
So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you -
You don't have to kiss his ass anymore.
It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone.  Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.
Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?
Call us when you get there so we know you're OK. [Andy gets up and leaves]
[to Stanley] Hey! Good to have you back.
Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside.
Why couldn't have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?
Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.
That's funny.  Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it. [glares at Stanley's date]
Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X?
You can pay me back later for the makeover.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?
Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob.
Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme.
I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee.  I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine.
[Dwight's footsteps sound from the ceiling] Just drive away. Just..
Angela, you'll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it's the generic one. It's Stanley's favorite.
Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer.
Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest?
Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading.
[seeing a large red spot on Michael's lip] God! Wow!
Michael. [Michael throws Phyllis' keys under the car.]
Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck.
Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures?
[dressed as Raggedy Ann] Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?
You don't even know what I'm talking about.
[in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes?
Hi Michael. [Michael sits on her lap] Mm. 'kay.
Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't...
Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?
Oh, I���m gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.
What's gonna make you feel better, big guy?
Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.
Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?
Yeah, thank you. [As Phyllis enjoys Bob's meat, Jim and Pam look knowingly into the camera]
Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one.
Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please? [Erin moves Oscar out of the way for Phyllis]
[whispering] Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?
I can't be around sad people, it makes me sad.
I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.
That's a shame.  Ed was a good guy.
Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He���s not terrible.
Sort of. He had a lot of clients.
I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her.
Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela's having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.
We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while.
Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?
Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand.
It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I gave you a penguin.
Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.
Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain.
I was all-county my junior and senior years.
I have a new swimsuit I need to break in....
Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk.
I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.
After 16 years, it���s strange sitting across from somebody who isn���t Stanley. But���he���ll get there.
Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. [Kevin nods] Okay.
I don't care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise.
You left me in a bad part of town!
Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]
I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it. [she awkwardly hugs Jim] It's been a long journey... but [sniffles] I'm Santa Claus!
No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.
Well, we'll deal with it as it comes.
Michael, just give us our clients back.  That's all we care about.
I'm glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he's stupid.
You promised me this. Don't make me get Bob involved!
Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too.
Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.
We���re all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.
Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
We have a gym at home. It���s called the bedroom.
Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It���s all garbage okay? You���re the woman, I���m the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.
You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK?  [in character] I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.
No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat.
If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four.
I'm sorry.  It's the largest one I have.
There was no client.  Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car.  I had to walk home with no money and no phone.
Where would you like the Rice Krispy Treat stars?
It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?
Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.
I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up shot glass] I don't think they're appropriate anymore.
You tell me.  Well, you do mean you and Jim right?  Oh God.  I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and you're talking all the time.  I'm sorry!
Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five.
No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
Andy, I���ve been worried about you. How are you?
Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em.
You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary.  [sighs] No offense, Jim.  I think she's very pretty.
I'll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.
You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.
Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?
Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it?
No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.
Well, Bob was going to just drive me.
[to Ernesto] I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?
Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client.
But I won't be able to do inventory without it.
We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.
I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.
He asked if you've been acting withdrawn lately.
Look, I don���t feel safe. I think we should call the police.
It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.
Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done. [laughs]
You mean the clients you stole from us.
It's times like these, I wish my mother were with me right now.  She'd show me what to do.  That's stupid; she's not here.  [looks at watch] She's at water aerobics for the next forty-five minutes.
Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry.
Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy.
And when you fell in, did you flounder?
Oh I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held.
No, you knew me in high school.  Course, we all thought you were gay in high school.
You must have misdialed. This is Phyllis. No, I'm not sure what his extension is. [glares at Stanley as he glares right back]
Okay... [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
I can't see half of the things. [adjusts glasses]
Michael, you always said we were a family.  Then you went after us.
If you're just handing them out, I want one too.
I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down  she wouldn't be a good wife.
I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.
In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let's put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle's eye! Let the party begin! [Dwight plugs in tree lights, office applauds.]
The three of us have all been chairmen before.
I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't.
No. [trying to finish her sale when Michael hangs up the phone] I'm on a sale!
So, we're all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes?
Come on, Bob.  Raise your hand. [Bob does so reluctantly]
Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.
I'm excited about today. [whispers] I love girl talk.
Dwight! [Dwight pulls out a hunting knife and jumps off desk]
Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?
Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.
It's not like you can fire people or anything.
Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.
Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?
Andy, don���t make us sell this stupid thing.
Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt.  You should be apologizing to us.
Can I get a list of your vendors?
It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
I don't think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
Hey, Andy!  Maybe this is one of those situations where you just have to do her to get her out of your system.
What do we do? How do we stop this?
