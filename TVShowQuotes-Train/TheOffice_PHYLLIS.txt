Look, I don���t feel safe. I think we should call the police.
I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that...
Or the mini mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. You can get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your [to Nellie] boyfriend. But, I mean, if you don't have one of those you can probably just bring whoever it is you use to kill your loneliness.
You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?
I���m happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
If you're just handing them out, I want one too.
Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley.
Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?
Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. It���s hopeless.
So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?
You're arrogant and pompous, and I don't like you.
Can I get a list of your vendors?
We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while.
Haven't you been following the news? Ther university is using its non-profit status to fund its private real estate investments.
I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I'm on.
[in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes?
I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it?
Mmm, this won't help him, it's a muffin, not cake.
Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson���s a mean old grump. [laughs] But [crying] would a grump make this? It���s me. It���s me.
Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her ���gy-na��� for your entire meeting.
Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!
I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.
Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy.
[quietly, to Andy] Put your hand up, Norma Rae.
Michael... [Kelly enters conference room in a flirty red dress]
After 16 years, it���s strange sitting across from somebody who isn���t Stanley. But���he���ll get there.
Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things.
We think you made a big, big mistake.
The first thing I'd buy is new boobs. For my mom. She has the worst boobs. It- It's embarrassing.
Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?
Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme.
It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.
[notices Andy boxing up things from Erin's desk] What are you doing?
Angela, you'll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it's the generic one. It's Stanley's favorite.
What were you doing in the ladies room?!
They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
We're laughing at this cartoon! [passes newspaper to Dwight]
C���mon, just say you saw the list by accident.
Michael. You know, when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?
Michael, you make fun of us every day.
You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it.
I don't care what she's doing.  I just hope she keeps doing it.
This is ridiculous.  We just can't wait here.
Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me?  We'll take all afternoon. [whispering] Michael is terrified of bob.
I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y.
So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?
If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four.
Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin's hair with her hand]
[singing] Here I go again on my own.  Going down the only road I've ever known...
Oh, are those your kids? They���re so cute! They could be models.
I'll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.
I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go?
It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
Hit it, red! [���Boogie Wonderland��� by Earth Wind & Fire plays as Darryl dances with each member of the office]
Well, Andy���s cute, but he���s too vanilla, whereas Pete - he���s just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird.
Michael, why would we all go to the dump?
Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest?
Dwight! [Dwight pulls out a hunting knife and jumps off desk]
As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.
But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.
Michael. [Michael throws Phyllis' keys under the car.]
Robert's house is, well....I don't mean to sound offensive, but it's like where a basketball player would live.
I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down  she wouldn't be a good wife.
Yeah, the Syracuse branch can���t be happy you���re taking New York clients.
Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. [Kevin nods] Okay.
I can't see half of the things. [adjusts glasses]
If my daughter were asking me... [both giggle]
In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let's put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle's eye! Let the party begin! [Dwight plugs in tree lights, office applauds.]
Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested.
I'm good baby. [they kiss, both dressed as Santa]
He's a real catch and you should take him back.
[Takes here gift out of her bowl] Oh. What are these?
Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.
So, we're all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes?
I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today.  I'm really happy being here.
Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.
You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK?  [in character] I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.
He asked if you've been acting withdrawn lately.
[to Stanley] Hey! Good to have you back.
I know Sue. She's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheelchair, right?
I couldn't see your hands. [Jim shakes his hands] Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK?
When I was growing up, my mom said, 'the sky's the limit.'  I could do anything.  Be a teacher's aide, nurse's assistant, some kind of volunteer.  But now, I, I'm not so sure.
Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---
Andy sings beautifully. And he���s really good at dancing. He���s a good speaker. But there���s just something there you don���t want to look at.
[Dwight's footsteps sound from the ceiling] Just drive away. Just..
It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
You can pick one of these things.  It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.
I almost quit my job so I could be closer to Bob, and we're in the same building.
I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.
I'm sorry.  It's the largest one I have.
Well, we'll deal with it as it comes.
Call us when you get there so we know you're OK. [Andy gets up and leaves]
I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay.  Everything else goes in the drawer.
Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer.
When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?
Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.
It is so nice to go out with another couple.
What's gonna make you feel better, big guy?
First message is: 'I love you'.  That's from me.
[snatches ring] Then another woman will get it. We can't allow that. We have to destroy it.
We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.
You must have misdialed. This is Phyllis. No, I'm not sure what his extension is. [glares at Stanley as he glares right back]
It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good!
So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?
That's funny.  Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it. [glares at Stanley's date]
I know. I thought you two were nice together.
I don't know, I'm not used to the stress.
I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.
I think Jim would be a good boss. Plus he's eye candy. It's OK, Bob... Vance knows he's on my list. Um, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jim, and that British guy that got in trouble with a prostitute.
Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]
[hands Jim folder] Ask for Donald, Karen���s bananas.
[Micheal dressed as Phyllis, pretending to knit] Well, what are you talking about? [cracking noise] Ohh! Ohh! [falls onto the ground] I've fallen and I can't get up!
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. [laughs]
Close your mouth, sweetie.  You look like a trout.
Someone needs to clean it.  It smells like popcorn.
Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It���s all garbage okay? You���re the woman, I���m the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.
Oh, I���m gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.
Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene.
Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited.
You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why aren't you wearing the hairnet?
Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures?
I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs.
Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.
You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...
We have a gym at home. It���s called the bedroom.
Jim, don't listen to Andy.  I think it's so romantic.
That's what I said. He was spying in the ladies' room.
I was all-county my junior and senior years.
Where would you like the Rice Krispy Treat stars?
Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.
[grabs phone] Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle?
When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.
What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.
You tell me.  Well, you do mean you and Jim right?  Oh God.  I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and you're talking all the time.  I'm sorry!
She just crossed her arms together... that's bad.
You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary.  [sighs] No offense, Jim.  I think she's very pretty.
I invited someone to the party. Bob Vance. He works at Vance Refrigeration next door. That's how we met. [whispers] He's my boyfriend.
He and Pam are having their Valentine's Day lunch.
Dwight was in the ladies' room and he was looking at me.
Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.
Yeah, Dwight's right we should drop a bomb.
So, uh, show us how you���d normally sell to a female client.
We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.
Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play.
Yes, I got those cute little ones. [Angela looks at her disapprovingly] Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?
You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.
And when you fell in, did you flounder?
Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He���s not terrible.
Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus!
And this brings us to you, little one.
Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl.
How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?
I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.
This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!
It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.
Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.
I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
Why couldn't have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?
Michael, you always said we were a family.  Then you went after us.
I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works.
Well, thanks.  I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.
Of course you don't wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn't even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical.
Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So...  [Jim gestures for her to continue]
The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing.
Andy, I���ve been worried about you. How are you?
Yeah, I really like Stanley, but I'm not always sure if he likes me. I guess that's okay, 'cause I don't really like him.
What do we do? How do we stop this?
You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know.
Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.
Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients.
Are you gonna give me the leads or not?
Did the police solve the problem with the...
[on the phone] You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?
When I say it out loud it's so silly. [they both laugh]
Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping.
No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat.
I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I...
I don't need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone.
I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.
Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person.
Do you think they'll get the account. [Stanley stares at her] How come you never answer me?
An Xbox it is. Because I've decided you're a good boy.
Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client.
Do you have any idea what time we'll get out of here?
Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy.
Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. [Michael laughs]
Oh, we find little times during the day.
Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You've been very good this year -
[seeing a large red spot on Michael's lip] God! Wow!
I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?
Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five.
Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela's having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.
It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone.  Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.
Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.
Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.
Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know.
I didn't ask you where it was.  I told you where it needs to be.
Oh sure, a little piece.  Ooh, no mushroom though.
[dressed as Raggedy Ann] Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?
Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.
We know the branch is closing; Michael told us.
I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle]
Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he���s gone for who knows how long.
For your signature. [drops document on Michael's desk]
Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What?
Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you.
[Phyllis, Pam, Toby, and Oscar are sharing iPod headphones] I don't understand.  Which one is that?
No. [trying to finish her sale when Michael hangs up the phone] I'm on a sale!
But you don't know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again.
Mmm... sometimes her stockings have a run in them.
And if the food stations are here and here... no!  Here and here.  Drinks here, then people can mingle.  But then where would the band go?
I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school.
Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt.  You should be apologizing to us.
You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.
Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done. [laughs]
Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.
[at Michael return to Jim's office] Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!
[to Ernesto] I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?
Write him up or I'll take it to Jan.
My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you?
Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside.
[storms in the office, sweaty and out of breath] Are you insane?!
Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?
So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.
I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind.
Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes. [Angela and Pam look uncomfortable]
Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it?
Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry.
Tom?  He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. [blank stares] Tom? [acts like she's shooting herself in the head] Pow.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee.  The theme is 'Nights in Morocco'.  This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party.  Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate.
[as everyone returns to the office] Ah, geez. My nails aren't dry yet. I don't think I can work for at least a couple hours.
[on phone] I know, I know.  We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.
I'm glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he's stupid.
How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?
[whispering] Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?
Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.
You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality.
Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it.
Lots of things are cozy in the rain.
I would like to toast to the good fortune I've been having lately...
Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?
One time I said good morning to her, and she didn't say it back.
Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can���t just press a magic button.
But I won't be able to do inventory without it.
Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for.
I don't care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise.
This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood!
Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.
Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.
Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.
Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em.
Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?
And I imagine things are starting to heat up?
You should, you should put out salt for the rims [referring to margaritas]
Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?
[gasps] Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She's doing a book signing right now.
You don���t have to thank us for coming in, it���s our job.
[holds up mittens she's knitting] Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.
Ooh. Isn't that the one where the guy becomes limitless?
Oh, that's the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties.
I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up shot glass] I don't think they're appropriate anymore.
During our honeymoon safari in Africa, Bob and I were driving late at night, and he'd been drinking, and suddenly thump.  We hit something with our jeep.  It was probably a man.  We didn't know what to do.  We heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us, so we just kept driving as fast as we could.  We bribed the airline, got on a plane that night, and fled home.  Maybe it was just an ostrich.  In a soccer uniform.
No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.
[Pam walks out of the bathroom wearing her new red shirt] Woooooow.
No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.
I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.
The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?
Where did you save the list of exchanges?
No, I think they mean more like a politician.
Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.
I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.
Come on, Dwight, I think it's actually healthy to get it off your chest.
Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California?
Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?
There was no client.  Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car.  I had to walk home with no money and no phone.
I, uh, I met a man and I'm totally in love, and that's a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts...
Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.
Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen]
No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
You know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess.
Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck.
I need you to get rid of the tree.
Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars.
Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here.
[groaning while trying to open giant wine bottle] ha ha!
You promised me this. Don't make me get Bob involved!
[Balls up post-its and throws them in Angela's face]
You could put your cell phone in it instead.
Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?
I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.
Mm. I like your shoes. [Kelly has 5-inch heels on]
I have a new swimsuit I need to break in....
Andy, don���t make us sell this stupid thing.
Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.
Oh! When you got your new phone, that's when you asked for everyone's attention.
Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.
I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.
You don't even know what I'm talking about.
[under her breath] There's another party in the break room.
Dwight, you can���t go. You have a problem with women. You can���t sell to them.
I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense. But, they're also really fluffy.
It's times like these, I wish my mother were with me right now.  She'd show me what to do.  That's stupid; she's not here.  [looks at watch] She's at water aerobics for the next forty-five minutes.
It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ?
Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.
No, you knew me in high school.  Course, we all thought you were gay in high school.
Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?
Oh, I don't think it's blackmail.  Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight.  I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.
I can't be around sad people, it makes me sad.
Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?
Okay... [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.
Yeah, thank you. [As Phyllis enjoys Bob's meat, Jim and Pam look knowingly into the camera]
Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too.
Aw, what the hell? [goes to Vance Refrigeration] Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?
Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading.
Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?
Michael, just give us our clients back.  That's all we care about.
Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't...
It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was.
Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts. [Michael stares at her incredulously] But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads.
I wonder what people like about me? ... Probably my jugs.
We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.
I don't think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
What in the name of God is going on?!
Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one.
We���re all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw.  So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this. [whispering] So we're gonna try out some new things today.
Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering.
That's a shame.  Ed was a good guy.
Yeah, that���s all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?
Maybe that'll help. Is it cold in there?
You are my little teddy bear. I wantcha.
20 cartons of it's coming, on it's way.
But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out.
Goodnight Pam. [Leaves with oversized bear on back.]
Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud.
Oh, ok. [Phyllis signs for the package, opens an empty box]
It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.
Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk.
Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out.
How is that possible?  No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?
Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?
Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.
That's a halwa shabkia cookie.  They serve it during Ramadan. [Angela spits her cookie out]
Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up.
Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it.
Hey, Andy!  Maybe this is one of those situations where you just have to do her to get her out of your system.

An hour? I can't stay here an hour.
I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.
You can pay me back later for the makeover.
Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people.
You know what? I don���t know where the years went. �����Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don���t even recognize them.
