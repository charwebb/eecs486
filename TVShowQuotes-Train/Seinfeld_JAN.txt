You're
[thinks for a second] Where is it?
Oh yeah, Arizona's beautiful. Yeah. It's great to... great to see my sister.
You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?
How do you know that?
So music, should we turn some music?
Michael, Ed died over the weekend.
Okay, see you later. And try to be professional.
No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.
Thank you, thank you.
No.  But we can offer you 12.
You know what, Kevin?  Why don't you just go ahead and stare?  Because, you know, it's, it's fine with me.  I mean, this is sooo natural, and so beautiful, and...
Well, it's not all about numbers, Michael.
Nothing?
I know what a futon is, Michael.
That's my new assistant.
Well, today's not my birthday, so...
I am attracted to weird, wrong men.  I dated a violent karate instructor and then an unemployed fireman.  Life has been complicated.  I've made some decisions that I'm not proud of; my marriage, being overly litigious with my family.  I orgasm fairly easily. Michael was kind of like my dirty secret, you know, having sex with him, oh I was just turned on by my own degradation.  Um, why, anyway, I was told by somebody recently that I respect that I'm old enough to have a mature relationship, and that's what this whole evening is about and I have high hopes.
What?
He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it.  But he also knew that I did.  I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.
Fine Michael. Thank you.
Why did I hook up with Michael?
No, I do.
... touch that.
That's a serious offense!
Go by yourself.
Zoning out?
Josh Porter, Stamford.
Coming! [Dwight and a woman are at the door holding wine glasses and a cooler]
So-
I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.
I'm closer to firing you.
Michael!
Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back.
Michael?
What did I tell you about 'yeppers?'
The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.
Magically?
Go ahead.
Great.  Very good.
Michael, I need your help.
Yeah.
No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.  So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.
Michael... maybe... I mean...
[on phone]  We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. [to Pam]  Could you please tell Michael that I'm here?
Well, I faxed one over to you this morning.
What? No Michael!
Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table.
Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.
And you guys have a good time together.
You're sad about this.  I know that, and I wish that I...  but...  would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?
And Michael Scott, Scranton.
Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs.
Remember, it isn't just a pattern, It's a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior.
Thank you.  That's very sweet of you.
Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?
No. Okay. Stop. Go on...
What about him?
I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip.
Oh, they found her?
Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.
Let's just blow this party off.
Come on.
I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.
Oh, no, it's OK. [Puts hand in way of elevator door to stop from closing.] So, uh, Happy valentine's Day.
You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.
A quick drink?
I had to, I'm sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this.
[sarcastically] That's funny.
Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time...
You might have learned shapes, or blocks, or clocks, or colors. Or you might have learned that we're all, sisters and brothers.
Alright.
The person that you fired, Michael?
Very sunny. Family's important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.
Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I...
Just Jan Levinson.
FOR AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY!
How dare you, Michael? My personal life is off-limits to you.
Hello... Michael.
We've created an incentive program to increase sales.
I have some ideas.
I just didn't!
If you have a-
[eyes Pam] I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here.  The um, sliding glass door shattered. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?
Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.
Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me.  By my side.  Without even a thought.  That's just who you are.  I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me.  And that is a guy worth staying beside.  So, where's this train taking us?
Well, why are you sitting on a train?  Where are you going?
[on phone] My friends?  Michael, I was terminated.
It's not about a surprise party is it?
[on speakerphone] Are you on the toilet, Michael?
Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person.
I didn't mean it. I was...
Oh well don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated.
Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour.
Does anyone want a drink?
Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.
Stop that.
Oh, no, that's alright.  I wanna leave straight from there.
Well, I, you said you wanted to help, so I...
Uh, yeah.
Thanks.
Mich---
How's work going?
What is he doing here?
Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you.  [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light?
Where's Astrid?
Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.
What are you doing? What's going on? Excuse me.
I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.
Yeah.
Are you hearing me?
Thanks Pam.
[on phone] Yeah, what?
Well...
Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title.
I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself.
It's not Kevin's child.  Can't possibly be.  I mean, I don't know what I would do.  Sue... icide?
Wha...
[on the phone] Ed Truck died over the weekend.
I've never told you that I love you.
So, which health plan have you decided on?
How do you know I like that store?
Hey, one person is an integral part of the fabric---
Can we just move on to another question?
Please don't cry.
I know Scranton.
And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth. [everyone starts leaving]
No.
Mike... Michael. Please. I... I... really.
I'm your boss.
No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it.  Okay?
Okay, you know, I'm gonna go now, and...
With your looks, ok?  It's your personality.  I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.
Well, I paid for an ideal specimen.
Well, this is a highly exclusive establishment.
Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it.
You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.
So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription?
NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.
Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition.
Okay.
Of Ed?
...Happy birthday, Michael.
Why?
Oh, God.
Michael?
Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.
No, I...
Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means...
---or, or, or been a sponsor for the party itself.
No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.
Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now.  Do you understand?
Who is this?
Mm-hmm.
OK, give me the roll.  I'll do it.
Well, you should.
So which way is Chili's?
[cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry.
Bye Babe!
Michael, please.
OK.
[on phone] I'll be right there.
OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.
I'm divorced.
I'm good; how are you?
[on speakerphone] I understand how you feel, Michael.  I really do.  So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?
No.
Uh, how are you?
You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there.
Michael?
You know that I'm very serious here.
Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter.
We discussed that.
Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would?
We have gone through this.
It's like nothing's happening.
Hello, Michael.
Da--- Darryl from the warehouse?
You ok?
Yes, Michael, they do.
K?
[over phone] Mmhmm.
Really?
Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.
Yes, Pam?
Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch.
Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?
[singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' to Astrid] Being good isn't always easy / No matter how hard I try / When he started sweet-talking to me / He'd come and tell me everything is all right / He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right / Can I get away again tonight / The only one...
You mean breastfeed?
What?
I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.
What's... what's the matter?  What... what happened in there?
[puts away video camera facing the bed] Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.
I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.
Oh, please.
A booze cruise? What do you mean?
[on phone] Michael, how did this happen?  Where did all your money go?  I don't, I don't get this.  I really don't.  I don't know how you could be so irresponsible.  I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really.  I don't know what more to say.
How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner?
Good. This is Brenda Matlow from corporate training.
No, that's all right.
Well, I have to say that I am impressed, Michael. I know... I know how hard that was.
It said that.
Oh! Michael, for God sakes!
It was me!
OK.  You know what?  There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me.
Uh, yes, I did.
Why would he do that? Why would he call you, Michael? Why would my husband call you?
Really?
Period.
I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club.
OK, name please.
Tell me what?
Well if there's anything exciting about it it's because we both knew it was wrong!
Uh... come on.
Michael-
No I'm the princess, and the queen.
Michael.
Yeah?
Ok. Let's just go to a motel...
Oh. [they kiss] I'll put in a good word for you.
And, uh, hmm, excuse me, I've also confirmed the meeting this afternoon at four p.m.
Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote 'Beeswax. Not yours, Inc.'
Well, I think it sounds lovely. I think it sounds like a good idea.
Excuse me?
A little amuse-bouche, anyone?
Michael.  I need you to take this seriously.
Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.
Not super exciting.
So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.
[Jim, Josh, and Jan walk in the hotel lobby] Josh, um... [Jim continues walking ahead] Why don't you come up to my room for a couple of minutes and we can just go over the schedule for tomorrow together.
Yeah. Good job.
Fine, fast food's fine.
We all checked in?
Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics?
[crying] I'm just gonna check on dinner. [Jan gets up from the table]
Water? Water? [Toby gabs water, drinks, then throws back at Jan] Water babe?
Not like that.
You son of a bitch. You���re firing me? Where the hell do you get off?
Good.
Surely, you cannot be serious?
Hey babe?
Oh, God!  I mean, I just don't understand!  It's just
I can't feel... I can't feel anything that you're doing, Michael.
Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything.
Hello?
[checking the oven] Uh, not even close.
People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater.
That's too bad.
Don't say another word.
You went to a bachelor party at work?
Michael.
Alright.  But you will let me run this meeting.
I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?
So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.
Michael?
Martini please.
I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay?  But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let's have a [bleep]ing kid.
I didn't...
You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option.
Tell me what you did yesterday.
[Dwight opens door] Thank you, Dwight.
No it's not.  It's officially not.
Great.
... happen when...
[in the background] So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone?
No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize.
Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!
Michael, come on.  Running away from your problems won't solve anything.  You know that.
Michael.
Smoke?
I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?
Hi, Jim!
I -- I --
Yeah, it did...
Hi.
Ok, Toby, how about if you...
Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?
What? A union! What...
Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that [snaps her fingers]. They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael.
Fine. I will show you one... slide show.
[sighs, whistles] Michael, please would you not email while we're having lunch?
That's not my sense of humor.
I'm doing it right now. To you.
Did you call my ex?
Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense.
Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?
Been good.
Nice to see you.
Really.  You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok?
Okay, how dare you do that?
You son of a bitch!
Why would we need a signal?
I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.
Are you there Michael?
Hey.
I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.
[sobbing] Oh, I know, I know.  It's just... I'm sorry.  It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery.  Ohhh!  They make my moods totally unpredictable!  Wow!  What am I gonna do?
At least he's an artist.
And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...
This is a projection of the county's needs...
[on phone] You're broke?
Yeah. [singing] Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget... [laughs] I love that commercial.
Nice to see you too, Michael.
Cosmopolitan, please.
Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go.
[on phone] Hello?
Alright. [throws her keys at Oscar]
Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.
Uh, yes. Yes you can.
No no no, no names, no names,  no rhyming, no soundalikes.
There are always a million reasons not to do something.
I hate my life.
I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
Where���s Wallace?
I think you can.  I... what?
$300?
I love you too.
All right, fine, just a second. Hold on.
[doorbell] Oh, excuse us just a second.
Do you need to see the video again, Michael?
What?
Hi, Pam.
You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company.
No, I wanna know.  I wanna know!  Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!
No smiling.
Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease.  Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.
Oh, yeah, the afterbirth floats, yeah.
No, that's not---
You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top.  I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.
Well, what would you suggest?
What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about?
No! In the beginning we were not good.
You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?
Michael.
Great. Phyllis?
Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?
Michael, it has nothing-
Michael.
I thought she was Muslim.
So, this girl that I basically grew up with becomes Miss West Virginia, and then suddenly, all the boys start paying attention to me.  And it was funny because, you know, I never even considered myself beautiful until people started pointing it out to me.  You know, 'Jan, wow, you are so much more beautiful than Miss West Virginia.'  [laughs]  Ah, so that is why I uh... wait, Pam, what was your, what was your question?'
Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?
No, Michael. Oh, come on.
Just let me loosen my dress.
Can we come in?
David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please.
That sounds serious, Michael.
Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.
We'd been fighting for a while-
Good. Have you told anyone?
Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.
No, so what couldn't wait?
I...
Incidentally, what is the charity?
Michael, don't panic.
Fine.
So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um-
OK, you don't have any idea what I've been through, so, let's...
Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-
Oh. [door closes]
I didn't... I don't know...
[on the phone] This is Jan.
Thank you.
[on phone] Okay, where did he go?
Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Let's call it even.
Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.
Uh, come on Micheal, that's tacky.
I bet you are.
Yeah, it's a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb.
Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?
It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.
...Okay it's someone named Martin Nash.
So, I'm happy to be here.  It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well.
Goodbye, Michael.
Hey, Jim?
Christian, you don't have to listen to this.
Please don't smell me, Michael.
And this is my workspace.
I told you not to say it.  Do you remember that?
You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. [goes into Michael's office]
Alright.
Okay, this event has to have legitimate business content to be tax deductible.
No.
Okay, you know what?  I'm just not leaving.  I'm not leaving.  Not leaving.
It's nice.
You're over 75 years old?
[audio from slide show, singing] Mommy, you���re a princess. Mommy, you���re a superstar. Mommy you���re the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es?
Do we understand each other.
Michael Scott, you are here for a post mortem.
[under breath] Heaven help us. [aloud] Specifically.
I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser.
What did I just say?
We're good. [Michael tries to kiss Jan] Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?
Good, good, it's the best business reporting isn't it?
Michael---
I don't care how your day was Michael.
Okay.
Never for me always means never, ever, ever.
Hmm.
He's the only one  who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.
See you soon.
Good luck with your band.
I mean...
So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.
Ok. [gets up and goes over to the stereo and turns on Hunter's CD really loud]
Brenda.
How would a movie increase productivity Michael?  How on earth would it do that?
Okay, trivia!  Does anyone know what that means?
No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... we're not paying for this.
Bye-bye.
Not too good.
Please, sit yourself down.
The board's.
A futon's not a sofa.
Michael, just relax, okay?
What would you do differently?
Uh- [Michael signals for her to shh]
What does that mean?
No.
Well, Michael, I underestimated you.
Thank you very much.
And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.
I thought that you were their fearless leader.
Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please?
Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals...
Aw.
Are camera's there?
[walks through front door] Michael.
Where's Michael Scott?
Oh, yes, you will.
[coming up suddenly]  Are you eating?
I'm gonna make some calls.
How do I do it? Raise my daughter, work as director of office purchasing for this hospital and release an album of Dorris Day covers on my own label? If I knew I'd tell you.
That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion.
Can we please go in your office?
I'll talk to you later.
Four million.
Yeah.
And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.
OK, you know what, I don't think I need to do this one, because I only gained twelve pounds and I'm just going to get rid of all of that, so...
[laughs] I think you can handle it.
Is Michael in?
So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
Hi, Pam.
[on speakerphone] Okay, what is your goal for after lunch?
Goodbye. [hangs up]
Insightful, Pam.
Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we're still a work in progress here.
Yeah.
You keep it under my side of the mattress.
You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.
Yeah I'm really happy. Me and Astrid against the world. [laughs] We're loving it, yeah. I'm kind of a supermom.
How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.
Erratic?
Good.
Michael! Michael! Michael!
What?
So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.
To kinda clear my mind.
Ah.  Thanks, Dwight.
Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.
We're in a meeting.
Please sit down.
Really?
Hi.
How was improv?
Tell me what you did yesterday.
Are you gonna keep me in suspense? [Michael sighs]
You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?
Oh.
See, he fits perfectly.
Ohhh, God.
Hi.
You know, I... I thought about it and you are right.
Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?
Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him.
OK. [looks toward Craig] Craig,
Just the one.
Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner...
[to Albiny] 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer.
Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.
You know, imagine... you were gay.
What do you mean?
OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.
Oh, really? A surprise visit from his boss?
Yeah.
[now belting out the lyrics, even though Astrid is asleep] How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one...
Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.
It costs what it costs.
Oops.
Will you uh, [clicks tongue] you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business.
What?
What's this over the 'i'?
Michael. MICHAEL!
Is that what you're... Okay. Oh, you sound a little... A little upset.
What are you doing to him?  What... [sees neighbors' dog] is this about that stupid, ugly mutt?
Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.
Uh, we don't know. Probably. A few.
[laughing]
It's pine.
What have you generated, Michael?
[scoffs] I'm not sure that's realistic.
Oh no, Michael, Michael, please.  No, really.
Oh!
I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace  after all these years.  Oh, well. What are you doing?
Right uh, Michael.
So... we're good?
Still on speaker?
Best decision I ever made.
Good, good.
Of course.  I mean, there's nothing erotic about this, you know, it's, it's, it's what these [shakes a breast] were made for, you know, I mean they're full of baby milk, they're... nourishing my baby, so... [tosses head proudly, Creed comes up to stand next to Kevin, staring directly at Jan's chest]  Michael!
Shame on you.
Okay, Michael.  I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.
Michael.
Don���t patronize me.
Bye... thanks. [pumps fist] Yes!
Shut up.
It was.  Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I'll just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.
You drive, I had too much wine.
Uh, yes.
How are you?
No.
No rhyming!
What are you doing?
...in your office?
That is an excellent goal.
After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.
Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever.'
Yuh-huh.
Am I on speaker phone?
Yes, of course. It's important to celebrate our company's rich diversity. And, and in fact, Michael, if you had planned better, we might have been able to charter a bus to the event---
Does this work for you?
No?
What are you talking about?
Well, I just got into a little trouble with the neighbors.
Hello, Michael.
No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables.
Don't you know what I'm doing?
Well, I know sometimes you are and... that you wouldn't tell me, so I'm just going to assume that you are, and call me back when you're finished.
Ok.
You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam.
Joe Camel!
If you can account for your time...
We got it!
When did the check come?
...and I have to get back to work.
He's such a snake.
Yes, Michael is going to be cross-examined today, which'll be very, very risky for me, nonetheless, not an easy decision to make, but it's a deposition.  It's not going to be in front of a judge.  And it's four million dollars.
What's the bottom line?
The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?
Great! Uh-huh?
Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.
[on the phone] Michael, I'm gonna get going. I really don't think I need to be in this meeting.
I'm not...
Michael... [clears throat] I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... [takes Michael's hand] I'm sorry.
Yeah, so...
Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.
[giving a hug] Bye Hunter.
All right.  Um, I'm just going to lie down for a couple of minutes.  I'm exhausted, so um.  Remind me to talk to you about Astrid's 529.  Wake me in twenty.
I���m a very busy woman, so...
[sighs] I'll see you in ten minutes.
Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense.
And the birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there, so...
Oh, how thoughtful.
Michael, we discussed the IRS's regulations.
Stop.
Please? Thank you. very much.
Excuse me?
Okay!
Is anybody else in the...
All right, well then maybe there's another way, you know?  I mean, we could just... we'll think of something else.
NO!
Thank you.
It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.
Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.
Michael that's irrational.
[to a client] ...to accommodate the, uh, suppliers. [Seeing Michael and Dwight] Gentlemen! Nice to see you, it'll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B. [to client again] The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to...
...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you.  I did not.
Uh, that's fine. Let's just forget it.
There's no prize money.
I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.
You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other.
Now you're really not allowed in this session.
trid.
What? I'm sorry?
This is Jan.
Mmhmm.
What?
I guess, yes. I think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team, in case they want to pay their respects.
What's going on?
Conniving little runt. Put him through.
Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.
Awesome.
Michael.
Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.
Devon. The... Oh, is this the man that you...
[shouting] AND I'M A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.
I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?
Okay, let me make something clear. As embarrassing as this is, I feel that it needs to be said. There is nothing romantic or sexual going on with Michael and myself.
Really?
I didn't go.
Molly! David Wallace is in Vermont.
Well...
Live together.  Actually, wait a minute!  This could be great!  This could be perfect!  You know, my full-time job could be our relationship.  I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. [laughs] It could work.  This could work, really!
No, it wasn't.  Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.
Are you listening to me Michael?
Well... well, we will.
If it's a couple blocks away-
Oh, Andy.
Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan.
Come on, it's a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!
Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.
Michael.
What?
So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.
That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it.
Why?
[to Clark] Do you have a valid passport?
Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just. [kisses Michael]
Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7.
This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.
Michael, Michael, Michael, that's... yeah... that's too high.  I'll take that.
I thought she could attend tonight, and if your event is appropriate, you could give it to other branches.
YOU BURN IT. YOU BUY IT!
I was stupid.
I am not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business.
What, Michael.
Yes.
It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said 'Honey keep the trophies.'
What?
What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.
Oh, just stop making excuses and just dig in there.
Pam?
[kills Jim's character, giggles] Oh, you know what, I gotta see Josh right now, but remind me to tell you what Dwight said to me earlier, okay? You'll get a big kick out of it. [leaves]
Yeah!
Do you have a preference, upstairs first?
I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?
No. [To Christian] Thank you very much for meeting with us.  Have you been waiting long?
What are you doing here?
Okay, then. I will see you tonight.
Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse.
No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss.
...then maybe corporate can justify your salary.
Michael.
Uh, I'm fine, thank you.
What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?
Ok.
Aw.
You do?
We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match.
Yeah.  But, you know, it was my fault.
Mm-hmm.
What's wrong with you?
[answering the phone] Hello?
You know Pam, in Spain they often don't start eating until midnight.
This is a wonderful shower, everyone.  Thank you.
I just, [quietly] I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things.
I'm not going to do that Michael.
[Jan nurses Astrid with her top down, office workers try to work] Okay, 'Stridly, you want to try the other side?  Okay, here we go.  That's good.  Oh, good job.
Oh.
We just will.
So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.
Yeah.
I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister.
Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before...
[On speaker phone] Michael, I left a meeting.  What is so urgent?  Are you, are you okay?
Because nothing did, Michael.  It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same
Please, please.  Don't hurt him, okay?
[to Ryan] Hey.
Ohh... [Michael leaves and walks into conference room]
Astrid.
Oh, God.
... but it's very destructive.
...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it.
What is Diwali?
Oh.
Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down.
Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.
If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count.
Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?
No.
So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?
Tell Angela to send me a final invoice.
I am returning your many calls.
At this time in my life.  I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok?
I am really- [Michael kisses Jan] Thrilled. [Michael and Jan kiss again] Let's go.
Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?
Today.  All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?
Michael, now is not the time or the place.
How was your interview?
Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah.
Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with.
I can't, I can't-
Am I on camera?
Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize.
All right, well are you gonna take care of this?
Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting [to Pam] is it happening right now?
[wakes up on the reception couch] Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep.
I did, and I had a very late shift and I had a little bit of wine and I fell asleep.
Casino Night in the warehouse. Good sport.
Thank you.
Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.
Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?
Really?
[in Scranton] Where's Michael?
Excuse me.
And so, good job. Good job.
I'm heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.
[on phone] Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.
You do.
No, ok. Imagine there's a princess, who falls for a guy beneath her station, and the queen doesn't like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn't like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen!
Why am I here, Michael?
Hello? [Angela coughs and points to the conference room]
Really, Pam.  This is a dinner party. [walks away. Pam looks at Jim accusingly]
Assy! Awwhhh how was school?
[on speaker phone] It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael.
That's his ex.
I think so, Michael...
The board voted last night to close your branch.
You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.
I don't want to...
[in the background] Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about.
I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles. [puts a candle to Jim's nose] Smell.
Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want.
How about Chinese?
You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?
I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off.
Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?
Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.
I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.
Michael, what is this about you letting everyone leave work early today?
Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?
AND YOU'RE HARDLY MY FIRST!
Oh, I'm acting inappropriate? Get out.
You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.
Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?
Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five.
Good luck, Brenda.
Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].
I'm almost there, so we should have plenty of time to go over the presentation.
You can't have people undermining you.  Get control of your branch immediately.
[putting on a good face] Great! [walks off]
Um, no, I want it up. My hair.
[picking up Astrid] There you are.
I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent.
Gould, you said, Gould.
Michael!
Christian.
Thanks for the baby shower.  It was great.  And I'll see you... soon.
Okay. [Carol stares at Michael]
Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?
Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you?
Yeah.
Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales.
I don't think Christian has time for that.
I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.
Wait, wait, what cartoons?
In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me?
Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here.
Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this.  It's not that bad.
Well, it���s not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean, ���Cece��� is two letters and ���Astrid��� is... I mean, there���s even some adults who -- who -- who can���t spell it.
[on phone] Well, is he coming right back?
Just like that.
[looks around, noticing that no one is working] Wha... what's going on here?
Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo.
I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable though.
At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.
Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?
No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided.
Cece can���t spell her name.
Michael, shouldn't take more than an hour.
From the Scranton Branch.
[chuckles] Well, that -- that was -- that was me too.
Thank God.
I went to a sperm bank.
I know.
Brenda.
Michael!
[talking over Michael] Yup. Yes.
Michael?
Nice to meet you.
No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again.
Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing?
[on speakerphone] Michael, ...
This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I don't know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that's what Dr. Perry thinks.
This is my baby.
It was. Yes.
This is my office.
From sales?
Specifically
Are the cameras with you...
Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?
[running out the door)] Michael! [pleading] Michael. What are you doing to him?
Follow me.
Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future.
I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know.
Yeah. And I know... I know he was your boss, so I thought you should know.
Different salary. [laughs] You'll get there, don't worry.
So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two.
Hi.
Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.
That's not what it's called.
I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow.
Uh-huh, Bonfire.
And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know?  It's fine, actually, I do.  I really think it's great that it happened.  Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... [laughs]
He finished his movie? [frantically trying to open her car door, as if trying to get away from the camera crew] No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him.
This is the point, OK? You're wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you.
This is a very important-
Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I'm so sorry.  Excuse me.
[to waitress]  Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?
Uh, no.
[Sigh]
Uh when, when did, when last night?
Michael.
When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.
A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.
[to cell phone] Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. [to Pam] Hi.
Hello everyone. Hello Michael.
No.
Michael, he's your branch's HR rep...
Yeah, we're not doing my boobs, Michael.  OK, seven, someone give me the prize.  [to Astrid] Oh, it's OK...
I was watching Jim.
It's your job. So...
Michael.
Oh, me too. Me too.
Let's go.
Yes, they know, Michael.
Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth.  And it was really, really quite amazing.
Do we understand each other?
You had no right to do that, Michael.
Men love this one.
...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?
[laughs] I am not going to tell you yet.
Sometimes when he gets nervous he, uh, talks like Borat.
[looks at Lester]
Well, it's part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been...
So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
I feel sick.
IHop.
Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please.
Back?
Well...
You wanna dig into our relationship, go over it, see what killed it. Ok, I'm in.
I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet.
Ok, what... what is the situation Toby?
I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.
What party?
Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?
So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?
Great.  Uh, and listen.  Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present.
[Michael dips his steak into his wine] Can you not do that? It's disgusting.
Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam.
