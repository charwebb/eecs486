Hey, look who has some visitors. 

Young Eric has been here every day for the past two weeks, bless his heart.

Mr. Marsh is here to see you.

Can I help you?

Come, come, right over here.  We have a decent room here where you can play with the babies and nurture them. It's actually really great you're volunteering now, because our other little boy volunteer is just finishing up. 

Okay, we're gonna need to get Kenny some time to sleep now.

Paging Dr. Bender? Paging Dr. Bender, please? 

Doctor, Eric Cartman is here- 

Just a little more.  There we go. 

Jacket! 

O-kay. 

Ooooo, I think you're hitting the bone.

There, just take a seat over there.

Again?!  Now, Mr. Stewart, what did we say about trying to hold in Mr. Dookie? 

Oh. Well, I suppose a quick visit is okay. Maybe you kids can cheer them up. 

You'll have to make an appointment; the charge is two hundred and thirty dollars.

Because then I'll know if he partied too hard or if he tried to kill himself. 

Mr. Chef, is it?

It's a really great thing you're doing. We have so many abandoned babies and not enough people like yourself who care.

Doctor?

Yes, Doctor.

Hey, look who's here.

Doctor, Mr. Klein's test results came in. 

Oh my God!  What the-?! Doctor? Doctor?!

Just hold them, talk to them, play with them. You'll find they're so hungry for attention. Here's our crack baby ward now.  I know it isn't much but, we don't have a lot of funding, you see.

Can you help him, Doctor?

Yes, Doctor. 

Mrs... Garrison?

Everything okay in here?

Dr. Flores, dial 18-

Right away.

Was he an Obama supporter or a McCain supporter?

Clyde Harris? 

Reason?
