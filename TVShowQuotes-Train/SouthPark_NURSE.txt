Come, come, right over here.  We have a decent room here where you can play with the babies and nurture them. It's actually really great you're volunteering now, because our other little boy volunteer is just finishing up. 
Just hold them, talk to them, play with them. You'll find they're so hungry for attention. Here's our crack baby ward now.  I know it isn't much but, we don't have a lot of funding, you see.
Young Eric has been here every day for the past two weeks, bless his heart.
Because then I'll know if he partied too hard or if he tried to kill himself. 
You don't understand, kid: there's only two doctors on call, and Dr. Wilson is out celebrating in the streets somewhere.
Oh. Well, I suppose a quick visit is okay. Maybe you kids can cheer them up. 
Again?!  Now, Mr. Stewart, what did we say about trying to hold in Mr. Dookie? 
Was he an Obama supporter or a McCain supporter?
Okay, we're gonna need to get Kenny some time to sleep now.
You'll have to make an appointment; the charge is two hundred and thirty dollars.
