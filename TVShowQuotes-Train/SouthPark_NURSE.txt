Oh my God!  What the-?! Doctor? Doctor?!

You don't understand, kid: there's only two doctors on call, and Dr. Wilson is out celebrating in the streets somewhere.

Again?!  Now, Mr. Stewart, what did we say about trying to hold in Mr. Dookie? 

Mr. Marsh is here to see you.

Hey, look who has some visitors. 

Come, come, right over here.  We have a decent room here where you can play with the babies and nurture them. It's actually really great you're volunteering now, because our other little boy volunteer is just finishing up. 

You'll have to make an appointment; the charge is two hundred and thirty dollars.

Doctor, Mr. Klein's test results came in. 

Can I help you?

Mr. Chef, is it?

Doctor?

Yes, Doctor. 

Can you help him, Doctor?

Young Eric has been here every day for the past two weeks, bless his heart.

Was he an Obama supporter or a McCain supporter?

Jacket! 

Everything okay in here?

O-kay.Â 

There, just take a seat over there.

Hey, look who's here.

It's a really great thing you're doing. We have so many abandoned babies and not enough people like yourself who care.

Ooooo, I think you're hitting the bone.

Yes, Doctor.

Reason?

Just hold them, talk to them, play with them. You'll find they're so hungry for attention. Here's our crack baby ward now.  I know it isn't much but, we don't have a lot of funding, you see.

Clyde Harris? 

Okay, we're gonna need to get Kenny some time to sleep now.

Right away.

Doctor, Eric Cartman is here- 

Oh. Well, I suppose a quick visit is okay. Maybe you kids can cheer them up. 

Paging Dr. Bender? Paging Dr. Bender, please? 

Dr. Flores, dial 18-

Any allergies?

Just a little more.  There we go.
