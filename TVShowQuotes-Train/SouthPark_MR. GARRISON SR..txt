Uh, he doesn't have a gun.

Ub. Sure, of course.  Your mom's out at Bridge Night. You want a beer or somethin'?

Weh actually, I'm just... talking about a... son.

WHAT??

Uh, what's goin' on?

Won't be necessary.

Well, I won't have sex with him!

No no wait, uh, you don't understand.

What the hell are you talking about?! I never sexually abused you!

Uh, okay, like what?

What??

All right. It's just that... I mean... We're all family men here, right?

No! He's upset because I didn't molest him!

Uh, brother! Look, I didn't sexually abuse my son when he was younger!

Alright. Would you have sex with your son to save his life? 

Good night. 

Oh, my God! 

God-damnit! 

Thuh, that's me.

No! Nobody's got a gun!

I'm not going to molest you!

Uh, what?

I didn't do it because it's wrong!

Well, can I ask you guys a difficult question?

Should be fine.

Ah-I didn't! You knew I didn't!

I didn't do squat!  Here you go, a hundred bucks. 

A little, yeah! He thinks if I don't molest him it means I don't love him.

Uh huh.

Am I the only sane person left on earth?!

What can I do for ya?

Hold on a second: are you actually suggesting that I have sex with my 41-year old son?!

Well, I'm having some troubles at home.
