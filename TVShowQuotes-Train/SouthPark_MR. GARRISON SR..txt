Hold on a second: are you actually suggesting that I have sex with my 41-year old son?!
What the hell are you talking about?! I never sexually abused you!
Alright. Would you have sex with your son to save his life? 
Well, I just hope that NOW we can put the past behind us and, and try to be a normal family again.
Well, can I ask you guys a difficult question?
A little, yeah! He thinks if I don't molest him it means I don't love him.
Uh, brother! Look, I didn't sexually abuse my son when he was younger!
Am I the only sane person left on earth?!
No! He's upset because I didn't molest him!
Weh actually, I'm just... talking about a... son.
Ub. Sure, of course.  Your mom's out at Bridge Night. You want a beer or somethin'?
All right. It's just that... I mean... We're all family men here, right?
