I'm not your sex toy, you fucking pig! 
Oh. Well I suppose if we're going to die, we should die by the hands of our idols.
Oh Katie, I do believe we made the doctor angry.
Oh my God, they're famous!  Well hello sirs! It is such an honor to meet you! Oh Katie, I'm getting all goosebumpy and queefy. 
I'm sorry, doctor. I had air trapped in my vagina.
But those are just ginger snaps, Katie.  Could you get that, Katie? 
Oh certainly, though I feel we look a mess. 
Get out! Get out both of you!  We never want to see you again! 
That's right. We've written all about it in our new feminist book, Eat, Pray, Queef.
Well Reeg, it's like this: we think that queefing is a perfectly normal female bodily function. Why not have fun with it? 
We grew up watching you. You meant the world to us. We used to fantasize about pleasing you in all different ways. Know that it is an honor to die by your hand.
