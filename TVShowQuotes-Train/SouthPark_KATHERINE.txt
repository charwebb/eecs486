Get out! Get out both of you!  We never want to see you again! 
Oh Katie, I do believe we made the doctor angry.
Oh my God, they're famous!  Well hello sirs! It is such an honor to meet you! Oh Katie, I'm getting all goosebumpy and queefy. 
Oh. Well I suppose if we're going to die, we should die by the hands of our idols.
Well Reeg, it's like this: we think that queefing is a perfectly normal female bodily function. Why not have fun with it? 
But those are just ginger snaps, Katie.  Could you get that, Katie? 
Oh, this is a dream come true. I've always wanted to meet you, Phillip. 
Oh certainly, though I feel we look a mess. 
We grew up watching you. You meant the world to us. We used to fantasize about pleasing you in all different ways. Know that it is an honor to die by your hand. 
That's right. We've written all about it in our new feminist book, Eat, Pray, Queef.
I'm sorry, doctor. I had air trapped in my vagina.
