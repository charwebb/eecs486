We have to keep going - all the way back to the dealership. That was the plan.
But it needs it, Kramer! It needs it bad!
(Walking away) Ah, you can just go on without me.
(Pointing out) So, you want to know how far you can drive your friends car for free.
You - you can probably let go of my hand now.
Is it just the angle Im looking from?
Well, thats okay. (Pointing) Well make this next right, and swing around to get back to the dealership.
(Seeing the turn-off up ahead) Theres the dealer!
Have you ever been completely below the slash?
Actually, it looks like were gonna need some gas.
Uh, Mr. Kramer, were really not allowed to use the cars to run errands.
(Trying to look at the gas gauge) Where is it now?
(As the car slowly drifts off the road) Mr. Kramer, the road!
I wonder how much longer we could have lasted.
And look at these features, Mr. Kramer Anti-lock brakes, automatic climate control. Uh, (Points out the windshield) make a right at this corner, please. (Goes back to the features) An adjustable steering wheel, and Oh, Mr. Kramer, you missed the turn..
Oh, this is amazing! Oh, Ive never felt so alive!
We did! We pulled it off! I cant believe it! Wheres the needle?
Oh, Mr. Kramer, I gotta thank you. I - I learned a lot. Things are gonna be different for me now.
