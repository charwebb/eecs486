You - you can probably let go of my hand now.
I wonder how much longer we could have lasted.
We did! We pulled it off! I cant believe it! Wheres the needle?
Have you ever been completely below the slash?
(Walking away) Ah, you can just go on without me.
Well, thats okay. (Pointing) Well make this next right, and swing around to get back to the dealership.
We have to keep going - all the way back to the dealership. That was the plan.
Oh, Mr. Kramer, I gotta thank you. I - I learned a lot. Things are gonna be different for me now.
(Pointing out) So, you want to know how far you can drive your friends car for free.
Well, lets make it the plan! Lets just go for it! Like Thelma and Louise.
Actually, it looks like were gonna need some gas.
(As the car slowly drifts off the road) Mr. Kramer, the road!
(Seeing the turn-off up ahead) Theres the dealer!
And look at these features, Mr. Kramer Anti-lock brakes, automatic climate control. Uh, (Points out the windshield) make a right at this corner, please. (Goes back to the features) An adjustable steering wheel, and Oh, Mr. Kramer, you missed the turn..
But it needs it, Kramer! It needs it bad!
Oh, this is amazing! Oh, Ive never felt so alive!
(Trying to look at the gas gauge) Where is it now?
Uh, Mr. Kramer, were really not allowed to use the cars to run errands.
