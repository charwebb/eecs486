Ohh, that's an even better idea.  Come on in.

Don't tell me that that other NAMBLA is actually in South Park?!

Perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time.

We have to stop them or, or they could destroy everything. Time is short.

Sir, if making mutant animals spliced with humans is crazy…then…uhhhhh…hmmm…oh, nevermind.  I'm afraid there's been a bit of an incident at the ranch.  You see, I've created a large mutant clone of that little boy there, and he's broken free.

Mayor, I think the boys may have stumbled onto something here. You see, Mayor, frozen links are often found: dinosaur eggs, woolly mammoths. This specimen could be a missing link  in our evolution. If I can unfreeze the body, and perform an autopsy, I could learn much about this creature's people and its time.

I most certainly do! The cause of global warming is  Randy Marsh!  It was Marsh's theory on spontaneous combustion that told everyone to fart all they want. Now all the methane from all those farts has ripped a hole in our ozone layer. We are all doomed to die!

Yes, yes, that's... very funny, Jakov.  I... will need to examine Hope once more to see if the process worked. 

Diindoon - pig and elephant DNA just won't splice!  Although, maybe I could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours.

We need more than that! They'll only come back in increased numbers!

I'm glad that you could all come. I can finally reveal who the father of Eric Cartman is. But first, I want to thank Kenny McCormick for sacrificing his life--

Well, there's not a lot to see, but... Come in.  He's still not responding much to us; the shock is still settling in,  but we've made great progress now that he's in the habitat.

All right. From everyone's accounts, I've narrowed down Eric's possible father... to the people in this room: Officer Barbrady, Chef , Jimbo , Mr. Garrison , Ned, Chief Running Water, Gerald Broflovski , myself, my friend Kevin , or, the 1989 Denver Broncos.

You know, it's amazing what we can do with a little blood sample these days. 

They act just like normal turkeys, except they're evil.

Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot of work to do.  But it is my opinion that this man has been frozen in time for over 32 months!  Yes, it's true, although at this early stage we know very little about this man or the time from which he comes.

I'm so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering.

Erhum ehrum uh  The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is-

Ah! Here we see the ice man trying to gain Internet access on the computer. The Internet was still not very big in his time, so the Web frightens and confuses him.  It's okay, he can't hurt you.  It's one-way glass: he can't even see us.  And now the ice man watches television. 

He can't function out here in our time!

No, what did you say? Uh, use him for what?

No no, not exactly. But she did have a penis.  The fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so Mrs. Cartman's DNA match with Eric can only mean that she is his father, and she got another woman pregnant at the Drunken Barn Dance.

How luscious.  Our creature has come to fruition, boys.

They're increasing in number mayor. These are the vicious turkeys I warned you about.

As horrible as they were theh- they felt like a part of me. Perhaps I shouldn't be toying with God's creations, perhaps I should-

No! Come back! You can't get out! You'll never live!

As you can see, the ice man is listening to Ace of Base, which was a very popular group during his era, and primitive drumming soothed his people's tempers. 

He's fine, boys. And we're learning so much from him.

No son, this beast is a disgrace to genetic engineers everywhere.  Boys, I'm sorry I've caused you such - inconvenience.  I tried to play God, and I failed. 

Wait, wait.  I know a way to find out. 

Have you seen a man who looks similar to us, but with a thicker brow and an apish nose?

Oh, whoops.  Now tell me what you see.

Yes, and I need you to communicate with him. See if you can understand what he's saying. 

Yes! Yes, I think it worked!  You are going to be parents!

Well, that's that. Thank you all for playing.

That's it, Kevin. Now we can begin the autopsy.

Nono, we've got to think this through.  Mayor, this man has not been conscious for almost three years. He won't understand what he sees! He'll be frightened and confused!

Son, no.  Oh son, you've made a horrible mistake.  You've put all the people of South Park in jeopardy.

Fixed! Fixed! That was supposed to be my award, Kevin. I'll get him for this. Mark my words.

Thank you. Now, let's go get those other NAMBLA bastards before they hurt any of South Park's children!

My God, he really is alive. The ice must have preserved him!

At my laboratory. We can do DNA genetic testing. I'll take some of your blood along with the blood of everyone here, and we can determine who your father is.

Oh, uh, I suppose so uh.  Oh yes, over here.  Here I have rats splice with ducks, and gorillas spliced with mosquitos, and here I have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish.

And now, to continue, the father is indeed someone in this room.

Oh my God!  He only has one ass.  He's of no use to me, I'll have to burn the room.  Oh no, this entire expriment is turning out very bad.

You know, to provide food for the needy.

Somehow I don't think you're taking me seriously.

Hello, NAMBLA members. As the South Park representative- 

Come on, Steve. We've got work to do.  Unfreezing this body will be quite delicate work. We'll have to use the most advanced methods available.

Alright alright. The father of Eric Cartman is... Say, did anybody see that Terrance and Phillip special last month? Wasn't that just the funniest thing--

This is very exciting. He could be a Neanderthal. Or an Australopithecus from the Paleolithic era.  Do you see that, Kevin? These clothes are from Eddie Bauer. I haven't seen anybody wear clothes from Eddie Bauer since... 1996!  This is incredible! Think of all we can learn from this body! All that it can teach us! Let's just hope the press doesn't get wind of this right away. 

Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... Mrs. Cartman. 

Oh my God. It looks as if he's about to speak!

The test results are in this envelope.  Shall I... open it?

Thank you, Mayor. Oh, and boys, I, I can't give you a reward for finding this creature, but if you'd like, I'll let you name him.

Yes, and I may have made a horrible mistake. I was trying to genetically engineer turkeys for Thanksgiving.

He's been frozen for the last 32 months.

It's thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger, disease, pollution, even war.  I have created things that will change the world for the better.  For instance, here is a monkey with four asses.

He's terribly dangerous.  His brain is identical to yours.  I need you to help me find him.

I've managed to artificially inseminate Hope with your semen.

I knew that you were the only person who would listen to me Chef.

Ohh. I'm sure it was my brother again. He tries to shoot me every month.

What? No!  We're the North American Marlon Brando Look-Alikes. 

Beautiful, it's absolutely beautiful. My son, I think we've finally done it. 

We have to find him! He won't survive long out in the world!

Eeegads, he's out of control.  We'll have to destroy him.

An ice man, a man from the past. We must find him. Now, where is he?!

All I ever wanted was to genetically engineer something useful, but I failed.  Perhaps we shouldn't be toying with God's creations.  Perhaps we should just leave nature alone, to its simple one assed schematics.

And here, of course, is my four assed ostrich.  And my four assed mongoose.

Hawgh! If we could understand what he's saying, then maybe we could get some answers.  If only there was someone who could communicate with him on a level as primitive as his own, a mind like... a child.

Means the turkeys are growing at an exponential rate. If we don't destroy them all, they'll take over the town. Maybe the world.

Oh, pardon me, I tripped.  Could I have some hair please?

Oh.  Well I'm sorry children, but, pig and elephant DNA just won't splice.  Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?

Yes, well, Kevin has done a lot of work in figuring out just how related to us Steve really is. He came up with this drawing: 

Meaning that she has both male and female genitals.

Look here in my microscope; tell me what you see.

He's gone! The ice man has broken out!

Well, something went wrong and the turkeys broke free. And the worst part is, they're REALLY pissed off.

Yes. It took quite a while for me to understand as well. You see, Mrs. Cartman is a hermaphrodite. 

I tried to tell you, but you didn't listen.
