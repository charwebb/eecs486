No no, not exactly. But she did have a penis.  The fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so Mrs. Cartman's DNA match with Eric can only mean that she is his father, and she got another woman pregnant at the Drunken Barn Dance.
An ice man, a man from the past. We must find him. Now, where is he?!
Oh, whoops.  Now tell me what you see.
Well, there's not a lot to see, but... Come in.  He's still not responding much to us; the shock is still settling in,  but we've made great progress now that he's in the habitat.
It's thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger, disease, pollution, even war.  I have created things that will change the world for the better.  For instance, here is a monkey with four asses.
Beautiful, it's absolutely beautiful. My son, I think we've finally done it. 
This is very exciting. He could be a Neanderthal. Or an Australopithecus from the Paleolithic era.  Do you see that, Kevin? These clothes are from Eddie Bauer. I haven't seen anybody wear clothes from Eddie Bauer since... 1996!  This is incredible! Think of all we can learn from this body! All that it can teach us! Let's just hope the press doesn't get wind of this right away. 
Oh my God!  He only has one ass.  He's of no use to me, I'll have to burn the room.  Oh no, this entire expriment is turning out very bad.
Eeegads, he's out of control.  We'll have to destroy him.
Well, that's that. Thank you all for playing.
Alright, Marlon Brandos, they've got to be here somewhere. Let's try this room. 
Ohh, that's an even better idea.  Come on in.
Oh, uh, I suppose so uh.  Oh yes, over here.  Here I have rats splice with ducks, and gorillas spliced with mosquitos, and here I have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish.
Yes, yes, that's... very funny, Jakov.  I... will need to examine Hope once more to see if the process worked. 
He's terribly dangerous.  His brain is identical to yours.  I need you to help me find him.
You know, it's amazing what we can do with a little blood sample these days. 
Diindoon - pig and elephant DNA just won't splice!  Although, maybe I could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours.
Sir, if making mutant animals spliced with humans is crazy…then…uhhhhh…hmmm…oh, nevermind.  I'm afraid there's been a bit of an incident at the ranch.  You see, I've created a large mutant clone of that little boy there, and he's broken free.
We have to find him! He won't survive long out in the world!
That's it, Kevin. Now we can begin the autopsy.
He's been frozen for the last 32 months.
I knew that you were the only person who would listen to me Chef.
No, what did you say? Uh, use him for what?
And over here, Swiss cheese spliced with chalk, and a beard.
My God, he really is alive. The ice must have preserved him!
Oh.  Well I'm sorry children, but, pig and elephant DNA just won't splice.  Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?
As horrible as they were theh- they felt like a part of me. Perhaps I shouldn't be toying with God's creations, perhaps I should-
Oh my God. It looks as if he's about to speak!
Well, something went wrong and the turkeys broke free. And the worst part is, they're REALLY pissed off.
At my laboratory. We can do DNA genetic testing. I'll take some of your blood along with the blood of everyone here, and we can determine who your father is.
The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is-- 
We need more than that! They'll only come back in increased numbers!
No! Come back! You can't get out! You'll never live!
Son, no.  Oh son, you've made a horrible mistake.  You've put all the people of South Park in jeopardy.
Thank you. Now, let's go get those other NAMBLA bastards before they hurt any of South Park's children!
I'm glad that you could all come. I can finally reveal who the father of Eric Cartman is. But first, I want to thank Kenny McCormick for sacrificing his life--
Alright alright. The father of Eric Cartman is... Say, did anybody see that Terrance and Phillip special last month? Wasn't that just the funniest thing--
Yes, of course! I mean, that much testing will cost a pretty penny but...
Don't tell me that that other NAMBLA is actually in South Park?!
Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot of work to do.  But it is my opinion that this man has been frozen in time for over 32 months!  Yes, it's true, although at this early stage we know very little about this man or the time from which he comes.
Oh, pardon me, I tripped.  Could I have some hair please?
They're increasing in number mayor. These are the vicious turkeys I warned you about.
What? No!  We're the North American Marlon Brando Look-Alikes. 
Yes. Kevin and I designed a habitat for Steve to live in that is completely like his own world. Everything is 1996-oriented. 
All I ever wanted was to genetically engineer something useful, but I failed.  Perhaps we shouldn't be toying with God's creations.  Perhaps we should just leave nature alone, to its simple one assed schematics.
Somehow I don't think you're taking me seriously.
Yes, and I need you to communicate with him. See if you can understand what he's saying. 
Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... John Elway. 
Erhum ehrum uh  The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is-
But all those poor turkeys, theh- they're all dead.
Yes, well, Kevin has done a lot of work in figuring out just how related to us Steve really is. He came up with this drawing: 
Yes, and I may have made a horrible mistake. I was trying to genetically engineer turkeys for Thanksgiving.
Fixed! Fixed! That was supposed to be my award, Kevin. I'll get him for this. Mark my words.
Come on, Steve. We've got work to do.  Unfreezing this body will be quite delicate work. We'll have to use the most advanced methods available.
How luscious.  Our creature has come to fruition, boys.
Wait, wait.  I know a way to find out. 
All right. From everyone's accounts, I've narrowed down Eric's possible father... to the people in this room: Officer Barbrady, Chef , Jimbo , Mr. Garrison , Ned, Chief Running Water, Gerald Broflovski , myself, my friend Kevin , or, the 1989 Denver Broncos.
Thank you, Mayor. Oh, and boys, I, I can't give you a reward for finding this creature, but if you'd like, I'll let you name him.
Yes! Yes, I think it worked!  You are going to be parents!
I most certainly do! The cause of global warming is  Randy Marsh!  It was Marsh's theory on spontaneous combustion that told everyone to fart all they want. Now all the methane from all those farts has ripped a hole in our ozone layer. We are all doomed to die!
I've managed to artificially inseminate Hope with your semen.
I tried to tell you, but you didn't listen.
Meaning that she has both male and female genitals.
Perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time.
Mayor, I think the boys may have stumbled onto something here. You see, Mayor, frozen links are often found: dinosaur eggs, woolly mammoths. This specimen could be a missing link  in our evolution. If I can unfreeze the body, and perform an autopsy, I could learn much about this creature's people and its time.
He's gone! The ice man has broken out!
They act just like normal turkeys, except they're evil.
Nono, we've got to think this through.  Mayor, this man has not been conscious for almost three years. He won't understand what he sees! He'll be frightened and confused!
Have you seen a man who looks similar to us, but with a thicker brow and an apish nose?
Hawgh! If we could understand what he's saying, then maybe we could get some answers.  If only there was someone who could communicate with him on a level as primitive as his own, a mind like... a child.
You know, to provide food for the needy.
The test results are in this envelope.  Shall I... open it?
Look here in my microscope; tell me what you see.
As you can see, the ice man is listening to Ace of Base, which was a very popular group during his era, and primitive drumming soothed his people's tempers. 
I'm so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering.
And now, to continue, the father is indeed someone in this room.
Oh thank Buddha I found you boys.  You must tell me, have you seen anything odd lately?
Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... Mrs. Cartman. 
He's fine, boys. And we're learning so much from him.
Yes. It took quite a while for me to understand as well. You see, Mrs. Cartman is a hermaphrodite.
