No, I will stay with Elaine. It would be rude.
Man, it wasn't the AM/PM. It was the volume.
For God's sake...! (gets up and they start packing)
Phew... this son of a bitch is ice-cold. (smiles)
Yes, the volume. There was a separate knob for the radio alarm.
Man, I just want to get some sleep. (gets into bed)
It's a marathon, you know. 26 miles! I need to get some sleep! (lies on the sofa)
Ah, man, very good soak. The soak o'the year!
(looks at the baby) oooooh...look at the cute little bastard... (the building manager comes in) you are mama's little bastard, aren't you? (laughs)
I trust Elaine, she is my friend. I trust Elaine, she is my friend.
Man, it wasn't the snooze. Most people think it was the snooze, but no, no snooze.
Yes, separate knob. Why separate knob?! Why separate knob?! (frustrated)
(smiling) Oh come on, you son of a bitch. I'm just trying to be friendly.
