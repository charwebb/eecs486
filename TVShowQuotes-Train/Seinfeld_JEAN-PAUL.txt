Man, I just want to get some sleep. (gets into bed)
For God's sake...! (gets up and they start packing)
Yes, the volume. There was a separate knob for the radio alarm.
Man, whatever! (annoyed)
847!? (jumps out of the sofa)
Man, it wasn't the AM/PM. It was the volume.
I'm a friend of Elaine's.
Yes, separate knob. Why separate knob?! Why separate knob?! (frustrated)
Me too. (disappointed)
Man, he doesn't got "in" for you.
Man, it wasn't the snooze. Most people think it was the snooze, but no, no snooze.
Fine, adult contemporary. Just pick one! (irritated)
Hello.
What are you saying?
I'm late, man, I'm in the race!
Nice to meet you.
Left a comfortable hotel bedroom for this!
Oh, please, man, please!
Idiot! I trusted you!
Ah, man, very good soak. The soak o'the year!
What...but I got a race tomorrow!
I trust Elaine, she is my friend. I trust Elaine, she is my friend.
What is it...?
No, no.
It's a marathon, you know. 26 miles! I need to get some sleep! (lies on the sofa)
Yes, yes, the wake-up guy.
It is his job!
You miss-set the timer...
Really?!
Wake-up call...
Ok.
Phew... this son of a bitch is ice-cold. (smiles)
Thank you Jerry, you're a wonderful driver. Fantastic route, man!
No, I will stay with Elaine. It would be rude.
