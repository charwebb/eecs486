What are you saying?
Really?!
I'm late, man, I'm in the race!
Me too. (disappointed)
You miss-set the timer...
Yes, separate knob. Why separate knob?! Why separate knob?! (frustrated)
Man, I just want to get some sleep. (gets into bed)
Phew... this son of a bitch is ice-cold. (smiles)
Thank you Jerry, you're a wonderful driver. Fantastic route, man!
I trust Elaine, she is my friend. I trust Elaine, she is my friend.
It is his job!
(looks at the baby) oooooh...look at the cute little bastard... (the building manager comes in) you are mama's little bastard, aren't you? (laughs)
For God's sake...! (gets up and they start packing)
I'm a friend of Elaine's.
Fine, adult contemporary. Just pick one! (irritated)
847!? (jumps out of the sofa)
Oh, please, man, please!
What is it...?
Left a comfortable hotel bedroom for this!
Nice to meet you.
Man, it wasn't the AM/PM. It was the volume.
What...but I got a race tomorrow!
Yes, yes, the wake-up guy.
Yes, the volume. There was a separate knob for the radio alarm.
No, I will stay with Elaine. It would be rude.
Wake-up call...
Man, it wasn't the snooze. Most people think it was the snooze, but no, no snooze.
Flight to Cleveland?
Hello.
Ah, man, very good soak. The soak o'the year!
Idiot! I trusted you!
No, no.
Ok.
Man, he doesn't got "in" for you.
