Man, it wasn't the AM/PM. It was the volume.
Man, I just want to get some sleep. (gets into bed)
Man, it wasn't the snooze. Most people think it was the snooze, but no, no snooze.
For God's sake...! (gets up and they start packing)
(smiling) Oh come on, you son of a bitch. I'm just trying to be friendly.
Ah, man, very good soak. The soak o'the year!
Yes, separate knob. Why separate knob?! Why separate knob?! (frustrated)
Phew... this son of a bitch is ice-cold. (smiles)
It's a marathon, you know. 26 miles! I need to get some sleep! (lies on the sofa)
No, I will stay with Elaine. It would be rude.
Thank you Jerry, you're a wonderful driver. Fantastic route, man!
(looks at the baby) oooooh...look at the cute little bastard... (the building manager comes in) you are mama's little bastard, aren't you? (laughs)
Yes, the volume. There was a separate knob for the radio alarm.
