(smiling) Oh come on, you son of a bitch. I'm just trying to be friendly.
847!? (jumps out of the sofa)
For God's sake...! (gets up and they start packing)
Wake-up call...
What...but I got a race tomorrow!
Man, he doesn't got "in" for you.
No, I will stay with Elaine. It would be rude.
Man, whatever! (annoyed)
Man, I just want to get some sleep. (gets into bed)
Yes, the volume. There was a separate knob for the radio alarm.
Oh, please, man, please!
I trust Elaine, she is my friend. I trust Elaine, she is my friend.
Flight to Cleveland?
Really?!
Hello.
Yes, yes, the wake-up guy.
Yes, separate knob. Why separate knob?! Why separate knob?! (frustrated)
Left a comfortable hotel bedroom for this!
I'm late, man, I'm in the race!
You miss-set the timer...
(looks at the baby) oooooh...look at the cute little bastard... (the building manager comes in) you are mama's little bastard, aren't you? (laughs)
Man, it wasn't the snooze. Most people think it was the snooze, but no, no snooze.
It's a marathon, you know. 26 miles! I need to get some sleep! (lies on the sofa)
Me too. (disappointed)
Idiot! I trusted you!
Thank you Jerry, you're a wonderful driver. Fantastic route, man!
I'm a friend of Elaine's.
It is his job!
Fine, adult contemporary. Just pick one! (irritated)
Man, it wasn't the AM/PM. It was the volume.
Nice to meet you.
What is it...?
What are you saying?
No, no.
