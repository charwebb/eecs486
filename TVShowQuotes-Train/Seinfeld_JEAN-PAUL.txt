Idiot! I trusted you!
Yes, separate knob. Why separate knob?! Why separate knob?! (frustrated)
No, no.
Fine, adult contemporary. Just pick one! (irritated)
It is his job!
Hello.
Thank you Jerry, you're a wonderful driver. Fantastic route, man!
Man, he doesn't got "in" for you.
Phew... this son of a bitch is ice-cold. (smiles)
You miss-set the timer...
Man, I just want to get some sleep. (gets into bed)
Ok.
Yes, yes, the wake-up guy.
No, I will stay with Elaine. It would be rude.
Man, it wasn't the AM/PM. It was the volume.
It's a marathon, you know. 26 miles! I need to get some sleep! (lies on the sofa)
What is it...?
Oh, please, man, please!
What are you saying?
(smiling) Oh come on, you son of a bitch. I'm just trying to be friendly.
Wake-up call...
Yes, the volume. There was a separate knob for the radio alarm.
I'm late, man, I'm in the race!
Man, it wasn't the snooze. Most people think it was the snooze, but no, no snooze.
Man, whatever! (annoyed)
Me too. (disappointed)
What...but I got a race tomorrow!
For God's sake...! (gets up and they start packing)
847!? (jumps out of the sofa)
I'm a friend of Elaine's.
Nice to meet you.
Really?!
I trust Elaine, she is my friend. I trust Elaine, she is my friend.
(looks at the baby) oooooh...look at the cute little bastard... (the building manager comes in) you are mama's little bastard, aren't you? (laughs)
