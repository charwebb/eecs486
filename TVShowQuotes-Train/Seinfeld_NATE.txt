[riding in car, looking for new office] Ten thousand seven hundred and six.
Dwight called my house, but he didn���t realize that I had already moved out, because my mom and I are quarrelling because I- I can���t stay out of her stuff.
Hey Pam, Dwight's being questioned by the police in connection with a string of dog-nappings that ha...
[quietly] Okay.
Let me put you on hold for just one 'eensy sec.
[picks up blowtorch]
Can I open it?
What?
How long you, does it take usually? Cause...
Ah! See, I, I, I thought it was because they're so rich they could all eat popsicles all the time. [laughs] I, in my, I...
Also, FYI, ah, I don't techinically have a hearing problem, but sometimes when there's a lot of noises occurring uh at the same time, I'll hear 'em as one big jumble. Uh, again it's not that I can't hear, uh because that's false. I can. Um, I just can't distinguish between everything I'm hearing.
When you do your makeup,
Yeah, they're Nate coupons. Or Nate-pons. And they're all different. Cash that one in and I will bring you a stick of gum, anytime, any place. I'll find you.
Got it. [taking a group photo outside]
Okay, on three. Uh, everyone in the air. Three, [some people jump] two, [others jump] one, [others jump] zero. [everyone begins to yell]
I've never met Ravi personally, but I'm gonna go ahead and say, just having knowing you a short while, Brian, that I prefer Ravi. And again, I've never even met the guy.
Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep.
I love it too Val. It's it's really itchy, uh but to be fair my head is constantly itching so I can't really peg it on the hat.
[picks up baseball bat, heads towards hornet's nest]
Oh Darryl, hey.
[points at Warehouse Worker Frank] He did it.
You had me at ���clookies.��� I can't wait to find out what they are.
He says, 'No.'
One, two, three. [everyone jumps at different times] Not everyone jumped.
One, two, three. [everyone jumps] Still some people not jumping.
So, she's gonna pull through again? [all nod] That's great. Can I talk to her?
How'd you know?
Ah, I can't wait. I'm sorry. I get too excited. [opens gift] Darryl.
Oh, hey Pam.
Yes, I'm really good at English.
I will look so handsome for you, Darryl.
No you're not.
Yeah.
[on the phone] Y'ello.
Si, yo muy bueno worker.
Pam. Pam?
Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She's on the ground by 'three'.
[reading card] ���I'm glad you're in my life. Happy Valentine's Day.��� Ugh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves.
Yeah, you know I, I felt really terrible that you got me these lovely gloves and I didn't get you anything...
[leaving] That's really rude.
What wa-, what was the last...I'm havin' a-
I don't think it goes that way.
Ah, he doesn't want any trouble, he sees lots of people, they come from all around to eat his delicious meat pockets.
Yeah.
I wasn't here. [places a book in front of Pam]
They're so elegant.
Scranton, y before that La Philadelphia.
Uh, I'm going to say 'I' when I'm talking for Ernesto, so instead of 'he says blah, blah, blah,' I'm going to say 'I say, blah, blah, blah,' but that's for him. Anyway, it was something like, 'He remembers Toby.' [makes face] 'I remember Toby.'
Gum's gotten mintier lately. Have you noticed? Like, some of it's just too minty. It's like they're literally trying to hurt...
