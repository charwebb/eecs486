So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?
It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually find it kind of intimidating.
(holding up her hand to show the stamp) I didn't wash.
Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this.
Wait till you taste this. (she eats) Poppie, this is perfect.
The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum. Over here...
Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know.
You better not let Poppie see you here.
You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge dent.
Remember we talked about taking a trip together?
So you really think I should do this?
Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back. What are you thinking about?
Jerry have some. (Jerry shakes his head doing "no") You're not gonna taste it? (still shaking) Jerry. (still shaking)
That's right. Poppie's on 77th. Ok we'll see you at 800. Bye-bye.
No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes.
You look like you've got something on your mind.
No, George is right. I want to get one.
