No, about the nose job.
No thanks.
(motioning to Kramer) Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful.
(to George) Hello.
I never heard that.
No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes.
I'm very busy here.
Uh huh.
George, I don't think this is working.
Yes.
How about him?
Hi.
Enough.
Jerry have some. (Jerry shakes his head doing "no") You're not gonna taste it? (still shaking) Jerry. (still shaking)
You see this perinasal sinus cavity?
What do they want from Poppie?
Remember we talked about taking a trip together?
I hate the dentist.
Mmm-hmm.
Many times.
(holding up her hand to show the stamp) I didn't wash.
So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?
That's right. Poppie's on 77th. Ok we'll see you at 800. Bye-bye.
Oh no, I've had just enough.
I know, they're good.
It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually find it kind of intimidating.
Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back. What are you thinking about?
No, George is right. I want to get one.
No (a resolute "no")
We could go to the Caribbean.
What's the smudge on your hand?
Um-hmm, I think almost all of them.
Wait till you taste this. (she eats) Poppie, this is perfect.
You look like you've got something on your mind.
Not sure.
So, what did you think?
Well, maybe I should.
Really?
Uh, who are you?
Jerry are you OK?
Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know.
Everything is delicious.
What are you doing here?
Hum! That was really good!
Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?
Poppie, this is Jerry.
He sure does.
George?
No, it's not that.
What is so special about this jacket?
The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum. Over here...
So you really think I should do this?
You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge dent.
You better not let Poppie see you here.
Can we drop this?
No, it's ok.
Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this.
You look like you've seen a ghost.
