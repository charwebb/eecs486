Oh no, I've had just enough.
You see this perinasal sinus cavity?
Hum! That was really good!
How about him?
Enough.
Ah! Poppie.
He sure does.
No, it's ok.
Many times.
I hate the dentist.
No, about the nose job.
What is so special about this jacket?
(to George) Hello.
That's right. Poppie's on 77th. Ok we'll see you at 800. Bye-bye.
You better not let Poppie see you here.
Can we drop this?
No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes.
(motioning to Kramer) Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful.
We could go to the Caribbean.
Jerry have some. (Jerry shakes his head doing "no") You're not gonna taste it? (still shaking) Jerry. (still shaking)
Uh huh.
George, I don't think this is working.
It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually find it kind of intimidating.
The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum. Over here...
Not sure.
(with hand covering nose) To the doctor!
I never heard that.
No.
No thanks.
Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know.
George?
What pie?
What's the smudge on your hand?
Yes.
Everything is delicious.
No, George is right. I want to get one.
What are you doing here?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back. What are you thinking about?
No (a resolute "no")
So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?
No (with a disgusted face)
No, it's not that.
You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge dent.
Jerry are you OK?
Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?
Hi.
Wait till you taste this. (she eats) Poppie, this is perfect.
I'm very busy here.
Well, maybe I should.
Poppie, this is Jerry.
(holding up her hand to show the stamp) I didn't wash.
Um-hmm, I think almost all of them.
What do they want from Poppie?
So you really think I should do this?
Uh, who are you?
Mmm-hmm.
Really?
