No (with a disgusted face)
The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum. Over here...
Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this.
So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?
It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually find it kind of intimidating.
I hate the dentist.
Um-hmm, I think almost all of them.
Jerry have some. (Jerry shakes his head doing "no") You're not gonna taste it? (still shaking) Jerry. (still shaking)
Many times.
No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes.
No thanks.
He sure does.
Enough.
You look like you've got something on your mind.
I never heard that.
Yes.
I'm very busy here.
What are you doing here?
Mmm-hmm.
Well, maybe I should.
I know, they're good.
Uh huh.
(motioning to Kramer) Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful.
Everything is delicious.
Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?
You see this perinasal sinus cavity?
We could go to the Caribbean.
Remember we talked about taking a trip together?
What is so special about this jacket?
No, it's ok.
Hum! That was really good!
No.
George, I don't think this is working.
Jerry are you OK?
That's right. Poppie's on 77th. Ok we'll see you at 800. Bye-bye.
You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge dent.
Can we drop this?
Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know.
Is anything wrong?
No (a resolute "no")
What's the smudge on your hand?
What do they want from Poppie?
Hi.
(with hand covering nose) To the doctor!
Not sure.
(holding up her hand to show the stamp) I didn't wash.
George?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Wait till you taste this. (she eats) Poppie, this is perfect.
No, about the nose job.
Ah! Poppie.
Poppie, this is Jerry.
Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back. What are you thinking about?
You better not let Poppie see you here.
How about him?
So, what did you think?
Uh, who are you?
So you really think I should do this?
