Jerry have some. (Jerry shakes his head doing "no") You're not gonna taste it? (still shaking) Jerry. (still shaking)
(with hand covering nose) To the doctor!
Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this.
Uh, who are you?
No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes.
That's right. Poppie's on 77th. Ok we'll see you at 800. Bye-bye.
What is so special about this jacket?
George?
You look like you've got something on your mind.
Poppie, this is Jerry.
What are you doing here?
No, George is right. I want to get one.
Wait till you taste this. (she eats) Poppie, this is perfect.
Hi.
No (with a disgusted face)
Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?
Yes.
We could go to the Caribbean.
How about him?
Uh huh.
What pie?
It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually find it kind of intimidating.
I'm very busy here.
I hate the dentist.
(holding up her hand to show the stamp) I didn't wash.
Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know.
No, it's not that.
Um-hmm, I think almost all of them.
What's the smudge on your hand?
So you really think I should do this?
(motioning to Kramer) Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful.
Really?
Enough.
Ah! Poppie.
(to George) Hello.
Well, maybe I should.
George, I don't think this is working.
Not sure.
The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum. Over here...
You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge dent.
I know, they're good.
Mmm-hmm.
Can we drop this?
Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back. What are you thinking about?
What do they want from Poppie?
Everything is delicious.
Many times.
So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?
Oh no, I've had just enough.
Is anything wrong?
Hum! That was really good!
No thanks.
Jerry are you OK?
So, what did you think?
No, it's ok.
No (a resolute "no")
No, about the nose job.
Remember we talked about taking a trip together?
