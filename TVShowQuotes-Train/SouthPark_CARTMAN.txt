I love you too, man. I just  You look so delicious! Must eat your brains! 
How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!
Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want.
Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it.  All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here.
Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. 
I can't! They're stapled to my head!  I hate you guys.
Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!
Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.
It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole.
He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men.
Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line.
You wanna take it out for a spin?
Aaand cut!  Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got!
I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices!
Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!
So... whatcha doin' for lunch? Eh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even baked cupcakes. 
Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!
Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!
No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle!  Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house! 
Oh no!  Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up?
My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends.
Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.
'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? 
Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?
Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you.
Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out. 
No! God damn it no!  Who's takin' a shit?!
You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?
Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!
I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass.  That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.
God these guys are so annoying, aren't they?Â CartmaaanBrah!
Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?  Byah. Oof! 
All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?
Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now.
I left my charger at home!  Fine! I'm gonna go home and charge my iPad and bring it tomorrow, and you guys are gonna feel really stupid! 
My God, this thing must really be powerful. 
Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?
Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually.  Um, Butters, could you get that?
Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?
Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town.  They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested
Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!
Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?
YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to fuck me!
Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day.
Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire. 
Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch.
Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, "Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it."
...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.
I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!
Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it.  Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket!  Ohooohhh!
Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!
Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week.
No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!
You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!!
I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.
If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.
No. NO! Must protect the border! Everyone's gettin through! No! Clyde! We're losing! Kyle go through! Oh no, now Stan's through! And Jimmy! It's over! The only Mexican left is Butters; we've got...  Butters!  Hey! Wake up you guys! Wake up, losers!
It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right?
So what are you gonna do with all these underpants that you steal?
NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.
Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!
Your Honor, my lawyer is just parking the car. He should be here any second.
I'm gonna miss him.  I'm gonna miss Chef and I...and I don't know how to tell him! 
Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays.
Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?
What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.
Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.
Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat?  Okay, let's go.  So how are things, Kyle?
Coming, Mom.  Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick!
Alright, alright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day. 
Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand! 
Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical!  Oh!
A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods?
I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things!
Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry. 
Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.
I like going to school now. Jakovasaurs are so cool. 
Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!
Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well...  let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. 
Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet.
That co- ugh.  That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning.
Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.
It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country!
Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle.  Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character.
Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.
Oh, fat bitch, huh?!  Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT!
Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about?
Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!
I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?
You guys! You guys, it's awesome! Holy shit you guys!  You guys, I've got it!
Tango tango tango! We've got it! Let's get it to the containment center! Go! 
And I like nothin' better than makin' fun of Jews.
And ripping on black people, though some people think it's rude, but you gotta- 
I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty?
Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean. I'm gonna have to smack it in the face. 
Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose. 
I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.
Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
Remember the time when Fonzie jumped over the buses with his motorcycle?
We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! 
No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's  AAAA no, NAAAA!  I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year.  Ah, I need to be going now.
I never wanna see you again!  Take! Your sunshine! And frakin'! Die! 
Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew.
THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!
I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!
Well ma'am, I have some exciting news.  We would like your child to play for the Crack Baby Athletic Association. 
Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this!  It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive!
Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around.
Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh. 
'Cause.  He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went.
Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls?
Oh, well, let me take this disk up to the Enterprise and see if Captain Kirk can decrypt it. 
I- I, I learned that... you shouldn't judge somebody because... that-no, wait.
All right, major stone shield potions should be...Oh God, I'm going to have diarrhea again. Ohhh...Duuuh...
Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. 
Ey! You used to work for me!  Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonofabitch! 
Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Hel-lo ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars?
No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you know, you're fuckin' fags. 
You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?
Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.
No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!
I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.
Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it!
Well, you can tell Kyle that he's a dirty goddam son of a bitch!!
Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle. You... just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money, hmhmm.
Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice. 
Huh, I think God has plenty of money.
Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says  "Step 2.  Add the Sea People eggs to the water; you will see sea life spring instantly."  Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready?
Aww, see? That's what I was gonna say!
But just remember that I do all the talking.
We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary.
Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!
Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face.
The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.
My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters.
They're like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground.
Calm down! Calm down! We can have special effects, too. Now, I know a lot is going wrong, but we've got to stick together to make this play work!  All of us! 
Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh?
Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.
So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves.
Of course I care about Christmas- Doh, Christ on a stick! 
Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like "Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!"
I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.
No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!
How much money did you micropay today, Stan?
Hey everybody! Listen up! I've got something to tell Kyle! 
You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!
Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke!  "Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?" There! 
A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some-- 
Well just, give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp.
I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.
Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted.
I would never let a woman kick my ass.  If she tried anything, I'd be like, "hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!"
You're-you're a worm. That's that's cool, that's cool.
Ah, hello everyone. Achtung.  My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.  Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done.
But you have to come back. We hate our new scout leader.
Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs. 
What are you talkin' about, "quit"? Huh! I don't remember that.
No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want!
It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?
God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist!
Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.
Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!
Yeah, well you got skinny arms!  'Scuse me. Move it.
Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy.
Eh, no, that, that was just a dream. And I'm not fat, I'm big boned!
He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.
All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.
Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.
Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time.
I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta! 
Crack baby basketball.  Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us!  We could actually really use you!
That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle.  Gentlemen, I'm off to start planning! 
That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*  
Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.
Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let's get a look at the celebrity watch, with Butters.
Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay.
Aw, dude, I think I might have it.
But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.
Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.
Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now. 
Wow, I get it now! I get it!  Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time.
No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.
Hey, I was kidding. There's actually two girls hiding down there. Hey! 
You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.
Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds!
Well, I saved you all the chicken part. 
No, nothing  No, nothing here! Nothing this way!  Tr... treasure.
Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, Kyle!
You guys. What if Ms. Crabtree doesn't come back, and we're all trapped here forever.
I was just-  I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial.
Bark bark bark.  Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket  and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants. 
Are you serious? How can there be-  Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers??
Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?
Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man. 
What? Well, that does sound pretty good.  Uh, Mom?
Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.
Yeah.  This one's yours, Stan. This one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters... 
Hit the PA system NOW!  Put me in the main line! 
Wait a minute! I've got it, you guys! We can get Kyle infected with AIDS! And then start a charity organization that we steal money from! Come on, let's go!  No? We can't give Kyle AIDS?
You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say.
But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny.  Don't touch me, Kenny. 
I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!
He-yeah, that's what Kyle's little brother is all right!  Ow! 
Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.
Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again.  We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself?
Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.
Oh, man, look at that one!  It looks delicious
The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!
Craig, could I talk to you real quick?  Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater.
My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers.
A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?
I got a Christmas present! I got a Christmas present!  ...Maybe I can see what it is. I'll just open one little corner.  Let's see here.  That's good, I'll rewrap it later!  Oh, sweet! Life-sized blow-up Antonio Banderas love doll! With realistic geni-ta-lia.  Oh, this kicks ass! What a cool Christmas present my mom got! 
Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners!Â Â Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right?
Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!
You guys!Â Â I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me!
All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo!  Wwwaaahhh!
Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.
I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?! 
Sweet. Oh, yeah, sweet. That's super sweet. Ah-yes!
You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free. 
Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.
Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money.
This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?
On my dream.  On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember...
Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey assholes!  You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right.
Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here. 
A package? Oh, really? Well, I think I can sign for that!
Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door!
Jakov, I want you to meet my friends.
Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- 
Aw man, that's too bad, Token. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop! 
All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!
Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you.  Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show.
Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!
You're a jakovasaur; that's what they call you.
Hit it, Tweek!  In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there's a lots of-
Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.
Token, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong.
No way, I set up mine first, hippie!
These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?!  Get out of my sight!  Lousy little scum!  What?!
Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.
You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is. 
Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.
Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing.
And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie.
Avast there, mateys!  Do ya have a thirst for adventure on the high seas of life?  Arrre you sick and tired of your parents and teachers telling you what to do all the time?  Then join Captain Cartman's Perfect Pirate Club, arrrr!  Just imagine it, me hearties! A life without rules, without homework and chores! You can live the pirate's life in Somalia, me friends!  Even Kyle said so.  Our first official pirate mee'in will be 4 pm today at Kevin Stoley's house!
Aha! I knew it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture!
Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas.  Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going?
But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.
Was I alarmed?  Yes.  I believe I was.
Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. He'd put balls on his chin. He was such an awesome friend.
God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I'll catch you at recess.  Fist bump. Fist bump, bro. 
Clyde, Clyde! What have I told you about pissing on the seat? And Clyde's all like "Ah, okay mom, fuck! Not in front of my friends! 
Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now. 
Yeah Token, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava.
Did you guys see a big panda bear in here, or not?
Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, "Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!"
Shut up, Butters.  Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning. 
Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy.  You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah. 
Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol. 
No, mine. M'yah!  Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha  bluh oh, ha-ow! 
...Very impressive, Kyle. But the holiday special is beginning soon. I'm afraid I can't let there be any distractions.Â Â You will find that my door has been sealed with a 3/4 inch plywood and a polymer-metal alloy secured with drewall screws.Â 
Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this,  but I am sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!
Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?
Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!
Tom Saltzman's dad is an alcoholic who drinks and drives! 
God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!
I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?
Well...  "Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"
Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it.
Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it.
I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?
But mom, seriously, it itches. I can't stand it!
How the hell are condoms gonna help us?!  Sorry, heh. Never mind, hehe. 
Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much. 
Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I-Â Â He's so fucking stupid.Â Â But I'm sure they will soon.
Suck my balls!!!  Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously-
Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too.
It it done?! It is all ready?! Alright alright, move aside everybody, move aside please. I gotta go.  Oh! Ahm. This is gonna be so awesome.  Aha! Lock! Privacy. Oh, this is gonna feel so good!  Perfect.  Yeah, you're gonna take it. You're all alone now, toilet. Nobody can hear you scream. Yeah, you're gonna open wide.  You're gonna TAKE your punishment! That's right! Get ready!  Oh my God, this is so awesome you guys! It's just like at home!
Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again!  You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!
No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be! 
Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?
Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle? 
Goddammit!  Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets.
Come on guys. Let's get out of here. 
Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!
But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps. 
Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th-
Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?
Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.
I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now.
Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  Wah! 
Dude, um, what are doing after school, Token? You wanna, you wanna hang out? 
Heh, he's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass.
No! That's my walkie-talkie, he gave it to me!
I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-
I don't know.  I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole.
Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! 
Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out!  The fuck?!
They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America.
It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. 
We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!
Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.
Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle.
Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase.
...You see.  Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature!
Uh what... what does that mean, "I'll be dead"? Hey, uh what, what was that "dead" part?
I got a jelly roll! I got a jelly roll! 
Hey, I know how we get the balls on Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks down the street! They're always making crasy masks and special effects for their dumb movies.
I told you I'm serious, Butters.  This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can.
It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps!
Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left.  Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang!
Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?
Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.
You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.
Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it.
No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!
Oh fine, go on and leave! I'm gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I'm gonna have your fuckin' balls! Fly to Christ.
I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you're a good listener.
Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them.
Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize.
What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight.
Yeah... Sometimes upholding the law is messy. But you get by. One day at a time.
Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time." When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.
NO KITTY, BAD KITTY!!!  Hahaha, you-hoo suck, dude.
Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized something.  We shouldn't be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us.  What have we become?
So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!
Oh shit, it's your dad! Go go go!Â Â I'll see you later at my house.
Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together.
No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.
Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.
Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here!  Oh, you got it. Nice. 
Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away.
No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters! 
Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.
U-hohhh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.
I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.
Son of a bitch!Â Â Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?!
Goddamn,  I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me, I'd be like, "Hey! You stupid son of a bitch! You-- How... How'd you like me to kick you in the nuts?!"
Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.
And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.
G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!! 
Heh, c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon!
Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.
Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know.  Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know, ...together?
Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.
H'you guys! Come quick!  You won't believe it!
I guess we gotta go back to school. 
I put a lot of Arby's horsey sauce on those.
Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!
No, Token! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah Token, Token!
Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good.
For centuries alchemists have tried to come up with a formula to make gold. Whoever could do it would of course become rich, and now-! The chemical equation is right before our eyes. 
Sweet! I'm gonna be rich. Bet you wish you hadn't given me that triangle back now, huh, Kyle? Dumbass! 
Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.  Sure, we'd be happy to take your money. Yup. Go to our kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, bye bye.
Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together.
I thought you weren't supposed to run around with scissors.
Seriously. Help.  Screw you guys. Hate you guys.
Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!
All right Butters, we're here.  Are you ready?
Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it!
Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again. 
I was just down in the SPC kickin' it with some G's on the Westsa-eed-eh.
Haha. You fools have no idea that I would never let you hurt the Wall-Mart.
Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.
Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?
I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo.
Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?!
What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!
It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.
Noooo...  Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.
Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!
Coming through. Oh how humiliating.  Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel.  Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have-  Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line!
I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you.
You're welcome, now leave us alone!!  Now! Let the extermination begin!  We will start... with the daywalker!
Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.
Hey guys, listen!  I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe.
We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!
Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!
Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!
That's right, Cupid Me. People who are the same belong together.
So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!
What- what's up?  What what's up?  Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you.
Hey! My mom says you're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed to call it a fireman.
It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!
All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now.
Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out!
God damn it, I didn't have an anal probe!  Screw you guys, I'm goin' home.
Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!
You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down.
Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.
Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool.
Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do itâhey come here, dog. Dog, come here! 
Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done?
Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus?
No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie! Bad Kitty--!  Eh, 'scuse me, Kitty.
Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home.
Well, I'm just saying na, don't mess with Kitty na.
Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?
God damn it, why is it every time we try to have a relaxing day a bunch of asshole on their Harley motorcycles show up?! 
Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle!  Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there.
All right! And now I will use my power to...  turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh! 
Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy!  Dude, what the hell?! Did you see the news?!
Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too?
A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? No, let me guess: It's a Frogman Jay doll! No wait, I know! It's a police power chopper!
Motherfucker!  The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, "alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming," and then after like a hundred pages I was like "alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end," and then I got to the last page, and I was all "the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!"
Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.
That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!
Yeah, well this year I have a secret weapon! 
For Show and Tell today I have brought...  ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!..  behind the 9/11 attacks! 
Okay, okay. I'll tell where the triangle is. It's inside my shoe. 
I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!
Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on "Saturday Night Live"?
You guys, you're so funny. No matter how I'm feeling, I can always count on you guys to lighten me up.
You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!
Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-!  Kyle? God damn it.
Noooo...  Oh Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck I want pancakes.
Right. I think I know exactly where to start.
You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart!
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it to the deep end.  I did it! I did it! I made it to the deep end! Hooray for me!
I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap!
This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak.
I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.
I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you! 
Okay, alright, so listen: I know our family is poor, okay?! But before we lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he's the poorest kid at this school!
Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing. 
You guys, come here.  This is totally awesome.
Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home.
Pfft, apologize?!  That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.
I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.
Guess what I have sitting in my back yard?
It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
Mmmm, noooo, Because I don't want to. Aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard. But hey, from one Redskin to another, go fuck yourself. 
I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?
Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility.
That's awesome, Butters.Â Â Keep making your way down the hallway. Your vital signs are looking good. What do you see now?Â 
Kenny.  Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me.
I-I did. I wrote something down.  Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle. 
That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh!  Theah!
Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?
Somebody's been in my room!  Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!
Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.
Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!
Um, could I get you to do something for me?
Look.  But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through. 
Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of  Scuzzlebutt?
My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!
Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad!  All right, let's be partners, Kyle.
Okay, that's it!  Screw you guys! I'm going home. 
My goodness, that's a lovely dress you are wearing, Polly Prissy Pants.
Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show?  Oh.
Who'd you expect? Maury Povich? Golly, you're hella lame!
You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!
Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!
What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times.
Oh. Uh, lessee.  I only got six dollars and twelve cents.
Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies.
Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.
Well, hi there.  Uh, wha-what are you doing tonight?
They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again.
Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?
Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people. 
Oh! Oh, did you hear him?!  This is exactly what Adele is talking about!  Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle!  Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day  to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers!  You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look!  I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!
The word is out.Â Â "Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts." I tweeted it.Â Â It's trending.
Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied!
Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls.
Just, could I talk to you, real quick?  What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Token?
Uh yes, I'm sure I can convince him to come on the show.  There will of course be a prize involved?  Great. I'll call you back in an hour.  No, thank you.  YES!
Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.
Get a couple facing the other way, brah. 
Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?
Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!
And his momma cried
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
Is another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto In the ghetto
Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!
Look at, look at the description. Brown eye! 
However long Craig wants it to last.  T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge.
AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please?
You don't drink tea in a ballpark, you French piece of crap!
Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!
Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work.
I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now!
Maaaa. Mah mah mh.  Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days?  In those days? In those days? In those days?
There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.
Dude, we don't wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head! 
No, dude, you gotta try it.  It makes you feel good.
Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me.
Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know.
Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle.  Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard. 
Well, why do I have to dress up like an old lady?
Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients!
Dumbass, it's November.  The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need.
TÃ¶ten sie die Juden. Wir kÃ¶nnen nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson. 
Well, I can't find anything- wait. What's this? 
Yes ma'am. I'm gonna be on television, I'm gonna be on television.
Hey, it kind of looks like Mr. Garrison.
Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat. 
Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit!
Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!  Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for!
Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.
Oh great! You see, Stan?! This is what you get for listening to Kyle!  "Oh, you've gotta help those people. It's your responsibility."
Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go.
Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow. 
Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime.
I don't believe it. She's using the Mel Gibson defense.
You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.
I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch. 
Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?
Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass.
Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say??
Antonio, no!  You son of a bitch chicken from outer space... thing, come back here! 
Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!
Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?!  What's wrong with him?
Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly.
Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.
She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.
I don't know, but it sounds pretty sweet.
Okay, Butters, I'm booting up the core competency now.Â Â Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?
Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all friends again. Our two houses brought together. Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s.Â Â And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs.Â Â Now, if you'll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit.Â Â What have you found out?
Huh? Oh no! Agh!  Get off me! Get off me! Somebody help!! Please?? Somebody get it off of me!! Get it off of me.
From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token. You just do all the singing, all the performing and all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us.
Yes! Yes, we can record an album next week! Sure we can write ten songs! We'll start tonight!!  We're gonna be rich!
Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?
But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.
Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!
Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk! 
He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.
What will become of the endeavoring American family?"
Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!
My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa.
Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita. 
Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our team, who totally sucks ass.
So where the hell are we going to get a dead body?
Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip! 
Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is. 
Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is the like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met.
"I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool."  Mom, answer that! "They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool." 
Aw damn, man. Now I'm missing the new Barnaby Jones.
I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more...
No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town.
Black or white, it's alright. Black or white, let's not fight.
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the jury, so don't blame me, son!
James my man was wrong (It's not our fault). James my man was wrong (It's not Eric's fault).
Black or white, it's alright. Black or white, let's not fight.
White people say Ho-oh!
I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!
It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up.
We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. 
Do you think I'm stupid?! I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle!!  No! Noooooo! 
Dude, I'm a pirate! What the devil do I care what me mudder thinks anymore?
Well, you see Butters, everything worked out.Â Â "Oh, thank you Eric. I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass."
Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?
Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!
I slaughtered five baby seals with my bare hands. What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!
What? Fuck Kyle.  Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.
Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you.
"That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes."
Okay, here's your ticket  and they're gonna have a car waiting for you at the gate in New York. 
Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!
No Sally Struthers, that's my cake eh-ehhhh!  You guys, Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!! 
Wendy,  I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight then I-
Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school?
It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.
You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese.
How do you even know I'm here in my room?
Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.
...I could pile at Shakey's, heck.  Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!
And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew.
Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush!
Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef.
Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks!  How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it.
Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir.
Would you like some more tea, Polly Prissy Pants?
Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry.
Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.
I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.
Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.  Fat Jew! Jew bitch!
Well then, perhaps we could interest you in  another butterscotch candy? 
Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!  I'm sick of it! It's completely immature.
The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me,  which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.
Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.
'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean "That's all right"! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!
Very well, Kenny! Let us battle!  Ow, Kenny. K-Kenny! Knock it off.
...and them I saw them all at the bus stop, and this son of a bitch is standing there!
But it's the only way for us to be happy. 
No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone!
Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true.
Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!
Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..
You're goin' down, bitch!  Nobody takes my ratings!
Yeah you! In the park this morning?! "I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!"
Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole!
Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew! 
It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom.Â 
Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it!  Oh no, it got Kyle!
Oho, looks like we've reached customer service, brahs. Now we can truly be everywhere!
Okay, well if you have a better idea, then why am I here? 
Oh, so now everybody wants to meet Mr. Hankey! He's a piece of crap.
Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?
Oooh, Two little hippies sit'n' in a tree...
Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude. 
Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro, and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch.
Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse!
NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!
Alright you guys, let's bring it in.  I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay?
We'll see about that.  Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny.
What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future.
Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Token, I would like you to meet my lawyer!  As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air!
Okay, fine!  I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him?
I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change.  The sun hurts my eyes. 
That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. 
When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-
Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!
Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle.  It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls.
Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.
Wait, wait wait wait. This doesn't make sense. This whole thing doesn't make any sense. I must be-
Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.
There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! 
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!
Will you tell me what they look like? The meteor shower. They mostly come every few years, mostly.
Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-
Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!
Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court.
No. See, must say, "Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?"
The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!
All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30.  We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory!
Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?  What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right!  My balls!
Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog.  Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your collar.  You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come home and save me.  Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope!  That's it! That's it, Mr. Kitty! 
Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk?
But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Well you're a fuckin' Jew Kyle! And now you're a Mexican Jew! You dirty, no good... Mexijew!  Let's just see you try and-!
Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built.  Oh, man!
Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash! 
You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company.
What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!
Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?!
It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!  Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool.  No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak.  What?
Ohh my God!  Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?
Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show.
Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here. 
Attention, shoppers. Outside, we have... cripple fight. Cripple fight outside! 
Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday!
Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything.
Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Good, that's good.  That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across.  Go easy. Good.
Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger.
But why? Why should they get the bell?
Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.
Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstocking.
Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you  it's not a joke.
It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs.
Okay, good idea.Â Â We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone!
At 1. p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.
Oh no, there's much more.  Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it "New Moon Rising".  I did a whole study using my ass.  Here it is using some high-contrast stuff.  trying out some... different light filters here.  But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass.
Oh there she is! There's my mom right now! 
Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls!  You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles. 
No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions.
Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house!
And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!
I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.
Ugh. UGHuh.  I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old! 
We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot.
Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?
Shh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now!
It didn't smell that bad; you guys are overreacting.
I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood.
I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are.  Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that.
Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?!
Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice.
Let's put our hands up, everyone! 'Cept for Jacob. His mom's so poor she only understands hand-OUTS. 
Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks
Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to freeze myself.  Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii.
It's okay Mr. Mackey. I'm totally over it.
Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-
All I know is, I got this sweet digital watch and these cool shoes; I'm telling you guys, suing people kicks ass!
Ike, will you do something about Clyde, please?  Very nice, Ike.  All right me hearties! Keep your eyes open for boats to plunder! 
Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?
Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'...  Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme.  Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this "Obama" wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline!  What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell!  You all know my pit boss, Butters.
Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass.
We're going to the water park,
The water park, the water park.
We're going to the water park,
Me and my best friends, except for Kyle who I don't like.
Ee-yes, by doing that,  and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!
Hey, what the fuck dude?! God fucking damn it!
Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!
Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?
Go ahead, that's more for us.  You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry?  Who's the hungry man?
You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.
So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman â and â see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! 
For he is LordLord, Lord, LordRight here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?!
Well, go put that pizza in the oven, bitch! I'm hungry!  Ow!
Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed! 
But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.
Well my hot spicy boner, of course, Dad.
You guys! I got it!  It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!
Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move!  We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese!
God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat-  Yes! I knew it! I'm saved! 
Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes.
Heh! Come on, stingray!  Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me!  Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go!
Parents?  Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around.
If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief!  Oh, yay! 
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.
And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool.
We will!  Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy band of the country! Someday you will all be among those who can say, "I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall."  And so, without further ado, all five members of the...
Not at all.  "Wendy, we're gonna get you Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!"
You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!
Gih-  Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please?
No, it was just a dream,  my mom said so.
Alright, they're gone!  The Cartman store is open! 
Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes!
Goddamnit!  Who the fuck do they think they are?!  This is the last fucking straw! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!
I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday.
Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!
This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me.
I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot.
Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone!
Could I see that again? That was cool.
But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?
We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.
It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.
Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth.
Aaahh!  You sons of bitches!  You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need. 
Yyeessss! Yyeessss!  Awesome!  Ho ho!  Sweet!  Yes!  Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seat belts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft!  Yes!  Yes!  Oh, cool!  Oh, look how much fun I had!  Whoa! Heheheheh.  Ah! Heheh.  Whoa! Heh, heheh.  Woooo, Adventure Island! Check it out! Awesome!  Yoohoo! Yeh-hehess!  Yehess!  I'm so happy! I'm so happy..!
Ahhh, good. A hostage will bring a fine ransom.  Well well well well well!
And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy?  At Besty Buy I'm sorry.  To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom?  Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?
How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?
Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!
No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!
I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it! 
I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do?
We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?
Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls.
Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy.
The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.
Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place.
U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her. 
Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?
Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people!
Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!
Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else! 
Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?
Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality.
You just hit each other, smack each other around. 
Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damnit!
Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?
Nonono. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second.  Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then?  Back then? Back then? Back then?  Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me.  With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.
It is wrong for me to ask questions?Is it wrong to seek the truth?I just can't blindly accept their version.I can't base my logic on proof.Almost all the evidence points one way,But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:I need to know what really happenedOn 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.What really happenedOn 9/11?Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?
You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! 'Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!
Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!
Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay? It's not expensive.
Token forfeits!  Whites win!  Whites win!  Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!
Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things.
Okay. Okay Wendy. I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now.
Don't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me!  They didn't take my Stormtrooper watch...  My Arkham City game is still here... what else could they have-   Oh my God.  Clyde Frog!
We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers,  which led to their collapse. But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel?  We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well,  but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane?
Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.
Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?
Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw.
No, but you got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it.
You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.
Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!
See? I told you guys it would work.
Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And...Right-click!  What the? Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions! 
Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something.
We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.
No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family.  I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could pretend like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, we could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day.
Now, the word is "spirituality." I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-
Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!
Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff!
Yeah, and I've learned something, too. Robert Smith kicks ass!  Oh no! She's back!
Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!
Yeah, I feel great. Why?  You think something's wrong? 
Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter.
If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct.
Okay fine, let him speak!  Then we kill every non-ginger here!  You... you what? 
Have you been a good boy, Kyle? Have you been making Grandma proud?
Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please?  Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. 
Goddamn it! When are they gonna say "shit"?!
You bet your fat clown ass it is!
They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.
And I am the official messenger boy, I am.
Yes, our conscience got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth. 
No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part.
They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.
Ah he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis.  Right guys? 
Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps!
Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea.
No way, dude! We're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin' parents!
Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it.
Oh dude, I just got the best idea
Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls! 
Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew!  I'm gonna get that feeding tube removed if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court! 
Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body. 
God I hate future TV. There's too many commercials! 
Well, Token's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know.
You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!
No! Think about the people who could get hurt!
Oh! God-damnit! Urh! You guys! You guys wanna hear my "I hate Stand and Kyle" song?! Ahem.I hate Stan and KyleI seriously hate Stan and Kyle...
In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one.
Yeah I got the stuff.  And I got the money. 
I only need one, dude. I only need one.
Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: "At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000" 
Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states "benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being." I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters? 
You guys are in big trouble! Now get me down from here!
Naw uh, 'cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for me.  What is that? WHAT IS THAT?!
Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time.
You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys! I mean-
Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother is away at a party right now.
The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!
Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this?  You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty.  Bad Mr. Kitty.  Bad kitty! No more memeing!  Come on, guys.  Bad Mr. Kitty!
Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!
A lot of stupid things that we regret.
I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to our basement!
I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.  We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. 
How about a robot? How much for the robot?
What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??
Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost Christmas! 
Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it.
Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you.
Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad.
And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.
His mom... His mom goes: "Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay."
All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool!  That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick!  Go ahead, Kyle.
Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick fromÂ Hunger Games' butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass!
I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once.
Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish?  Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow! 
Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.
You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!
Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company "Washington Redskins," it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people. 
Well, come on, we don't have a choice. 
No! No! The bread is all flat! No!
Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!
Come, Kyle. Do hurry.  Go ahead, it won't bite. 
...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick!  God damn it!
So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.
I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  You think about it. 
What?! Eeyy, you son of a bitch! I'll kick you in the nuts! 
Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am.
Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we? 
Well, he hasn't been here yet. Where's this? 
Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day.  However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood?  Alright, let's go. 
Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!
Okay, we're ready for the-  What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!
See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.
Nononono! You nyah, me nyah!  Screw you guys, I'ma going home.
Well why don't you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don't you tell everyone whatÂ PrometheusÂ was about while you're at it?!
It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now.
He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!! 
Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!  Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!
...Some happy, some sad; I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever, so the--
Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it?
No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service.
Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm starving to death!
Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!!  Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! 
Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-
If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-
Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home. 
You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!
Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.
Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!
Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny?  Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor.
Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding?  No Eric, go ahead and take my pudding, if you'd like.  Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you.
I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes.
God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk!
Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class, don't tell me how to run my hallway! 
Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle.
Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true.  Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! 
You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!
Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere.
It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt.
Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.
I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.
You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?
Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away.
Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today.
"Pretty cool." So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show.
Stan, nunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh hunh. Tunh tunh tunh tunh tinh teenh?
So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.
We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!
What does that have to do with me?
Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.
You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. 
Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus! 
Day is never finished, Massa got me working
Someday Massa set me free...
Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. 
You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!
You see that? Dayanica Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off!
-ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille 
Four hungry children and a-
What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.
Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!
All right. Gotta be strong.  There's still a lot more treasure to go. 
Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast.
No wait. I'll tell you.  He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him.
Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me.
Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.
This is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison.
God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland!
Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like  bitch! 
Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!
Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces!
Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On!
Wendy it isn't fair!  I ate my underwear for you! Nooo!  Yo, what's up dawg?
Fine! And then we'll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too!
All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'.
Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!
Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool.  It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.
And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?
So? So now I can do this!  Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!
And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he?  Is he a hero or a menace?  While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other... "Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right?" What we all need now-  Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important.  What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with my camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too.
So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. 
You will?  Ah.  Oh, ah, thank you for your help.
This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse! 
Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line! 
...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!
Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.
Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven.  So I guess it's cool. 
No. That's why I'm here. I think you should still give Heidi an A on the project. You see, I broke the egg, not her. And so, I should get an F, and she should get an A, which means that together the grade should average out to C minus for both of us.
This... is your pirate boat? Dude, the FUCK! Alright, seriously you guys? What kind of pirates are you? I mean, really? The FUCK, dude, the FUCK?!
No! No, nono, you're right Bebe! Farts totally aren't funny. 
Please just let me go! Ah, I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna-  I don't wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you! 
Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!
I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you put your who-who-dilly in her cha-cha, at the Drunken Barn Dance.
Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy!  Kyle, knock it off! 
Shhh, it's okay, Butters.  Nobody's gonna find the election ballots.  I have them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look.  A place in town people barely even know exists.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Did you hear that?!  "In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss."  Oh my God, Butters...  we need Vagisil!
And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say "Es ist Zeit fÃ¼r SÃ¤uberung," you all chant back "Wir mÃ¼ssen die Juden ausrotten."
That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.
Listen! I have a nice body and I want to show it off, you got that?
The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!
And girl you know you're cool, you're good, you're so much nicer, girl
You're good, You're gonna be--
Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny.
Laugh all you want, I'm the one who's gonna be on TV, looking all buff. 
Huh? First graders?  Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, y-you sons of bitches!
This is going to be hard to understand, Butters,Â Â but, you've become trapped in a simulation. None of this...Â Â is real.
Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcake!
Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.
Let's do this.  Stan, hook up my bra.
She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked.  You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom.
Hahahahahaaaha!  I got you kinda! I got you kinda!
Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my asscheecks.
Kenny-chan, please come home at once. Our two houses have found peace. Come to the Red Robin wedding, and we will accept you as the princess you are. Yours truly, the Wizard King.
No hey ut what, what I meant to say was "asslicker cumballs." And uhh,  I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! 
Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!
Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like!  Right, Mom?!  Mom?!
Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.
Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!
You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake.
Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us.
A Baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar...
Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon!
I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.
What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on?
Watch this. It's sooo funny.  Come 'ere, dog, come on.  Good dog.  Red rocket red rocket.  Red rocket. Red rocket.  Come on. 
I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF.
Okay, anyways. Now enough small talk, lads! It's time for us to start rapin' and plunderin'!
Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want!  Whatevuh! I'll do what I want!
What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay.  Put him on speaker.
Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox. 
What the hell? Can't find the server?  Kickstarter.com!  Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth!
Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmastime.
You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle. 
Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?
We did it you guys. We're totally heroes.
I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!!
Oh that's good that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle.  Yeah, nice.
Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock knock, Kyle!
Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live.  Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor. 
Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! 
No, Kitty, this is my pot pie, Kitty!
I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.
Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!
God, you know what, that's so true? Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.
-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!
You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!
Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location.
Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!
Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.
Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?
All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.
I'm trying to get my tri- wait a minute, I'm not talking to you. Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was trying to get my triangle back?
Were is Timmy?! He's on in one minute!
Okay, okay, hold your horses! God!  Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature!
It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo!
Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?
Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time.
We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.
You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!
Here. We got you some sticky cinnamon buns. 
Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!
I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top. 
Somebody, I guess, was spying on Craig's mom and they got pictures of her bush, and it's like, it's like a yeti. You guys wanna check it out?Â 
Don't stress about it or you just might faint.
They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!
Mom, I'm not going to win the spelling bee; I never do.
Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature,  excluding Stan and Kyle, of course.
Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month.
No no.  Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push.
HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!
Don't be jealous, guys.  This doesn't mean we can't still hang out.  It just means that I matured faster than you.  You'll get your pubes guys, someday.
Oh my God, that is what I've always said.  I love this guy!
Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!
Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!
I don't need the toy! I've found something better!  'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!
O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?!  Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?
Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one!
And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically.  I can take something as simple as this calculator  and... Trapper Keeper?
Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free.  We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run?  An ice cream truck! Hey wait!  Boy, am I glad to see you!
I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? and there are a hundred and ninety black people!
What the hell are you assholes doing here?!
Okay, I'll make it easy for you.  Pull the Mohammad episode, now!
I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast!
Yes!! Yes, I DID IT!! I crapped out my mouth!  I crapped out my mo-outh!  You owe me twenty bucks, dickface!
Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God! 
Well, there is the nice French cafÃ© downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there.
Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated!
Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You  you actually got her to come! 
So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks!
Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.
I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now! 
I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors.Â 
Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home! 
Looks like the game is over, old man! 
Noh, he always pukes when he's in love.
This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?!
Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services! 
It's time to celebrate, yeahIt's time to celebrate, yeah
Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.
Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act.
Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good?
You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow.
It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay!
Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here?  Flame on!  Flame off! 
Alright Butters, sit down at the computer.Â Â Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it!
You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.
Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now.
Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing card!  You can deny it, or cover it up.
Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you're so caring, Kyle, why don't you share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?!
Ms. Struthers, please. Just listen to me for one second. You started the Feed the Children Foundation for wonderful reasons: to help starving, helpless people who live in a rotten part of the world. Well, it's for those reasons we wanna help our friend Marvin now. 
I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if we were super-high level too?
...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-
I'm just letting you know how special you are to me.
We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. 
Why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day?
Oh, right. Why should we care?  Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, "It's not your problem." But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, "You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!"  Now who's with me?!! 
Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.
But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time. 
Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?
...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore. 
Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny? 
Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.
I don't trust any of you assholes!  Where are you sons of bitches?! 
How come the outline is missing its hand?
I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand. 
Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?
Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys.
Are you still trying to give a semen sample?
"It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation  to increase the population of the younger generation."
I know. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck.
Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's.  It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap.  I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area.  I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents.  And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. 
Step on up, get them here! Mr. Hankey & Me T-shirts! Get them while they last, folks. for only $14.95! 
Forward, men!Â Â That, no-Â Â No, you- You've gotta turn me.Â 
Thank you all for coming. Prince Token, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormickÂ . Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At Scott Malkinson's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves.
Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!
Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.
Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass.
Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it.
Muh-Mom, I've only just heard. They're making Chinpokomon dolls, mom. You can collect them all. You can collect them all, Mother; quick, come on. Let's go to the toy store.
I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew!
You guys, seriously! somebody get me down from here!
Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. 
No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it. 
Uh, god damnit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool. 
Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! 
We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own.
Hey bros, what's going on? This isÂ CartmaaanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already,Â 'cause subscribing makes you feel good! Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment onÂ Call Of Duty. More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting onÂ Call Of Duty, so let's start.Â 
This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!
Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.
Damnit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off!
When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.
You will? Wow, you guys are the best! Thank you guys!
I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
You're all just saying that to make me feel better.
That is so awesome!! Thank you God!  Oh praise God!
So our only solution is to cut off their life force.
It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!
Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here.
Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.
We should have never listened to you, Kyle.
You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup!
That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him!Â Â I said, "You can be a chick, Kenny, but there's only one ruler, and that's me!"Â 
I get to use it first you guys!  Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?
Wow, look at the size of these houses!
I told you this game was sweet, dude.
What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!
All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed.  Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!
He talked about having oral sex with my ass.
Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  Time in!  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!
It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!
Blululululululuh. I am the deadly Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. I am very scary... And dangerous!
Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!
In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, in the ghetto
I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog.  Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had. 
Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!
I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!
I am not gonna be bossed around by a chick!  Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over.
Heh, okay, okay.  You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead.  Dead??
That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason.
I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!
So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a  li'l ol' scheme  that involves them.
Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!
whatwhatwhatwhat?  Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!
...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes.
Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!
He hasn't said a word since we brought him here.
They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?!
That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off.
Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest?
All I know is I'm transginger, and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers.
But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here.
I I said "thank you." Thank you for listening. 
I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit!
Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you? 
Clear the streets! Everyone clear the streets! We've gotta get the fuck out of here!  Mom it's starting! We've gotta go!  Come on, come on!  Come on, we've gotta move! It's spreading! Let's go! 
It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all! 
Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay?
We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me where your son is!
All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf. 
Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off? 
Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!
Don't call me an asshole, you som' bitch.
Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-
Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?
...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away.
Okay, yeah, maybe.  God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us.
Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?
Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too.  One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards!
...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--
God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park.
Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!
Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second.  Mom, there's some homeless guy here. Make him go away. 
Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night.
You ginger Jersey Jew!  Your tactics don't work on me!
How could you know anything about who my family is?
You guys, you guys!  I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters!
Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.
Wait wait! Wait, look at the lady judge.  She's eating Chipotle.
Wha'evah! Wha'evah!  Maury, my mom can't control me, I'm tough! Go on, aks hurh!
Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured.  Ah sick!  Gross!  Yeck!  Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike...  vampires.
You guys, get me down from here!  Ow! Help! Sons o' bitches! Dildos!
Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list.
Oh my God, somebody shoot me in the head!
Hello, Precious. Yes, that's a good Precious.  Now it takes the lotion from the basket.
No, Kitty, you can't have these chicken tenders, because they are mine, and I keep mine to myself, oh?
Seems a little convenient, doesn't it?Â Â Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
I have never been a dick to you.
You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!
E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.
Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people!
Little pussy gnome. Don't call me a pussy, pussy gnome.
Alright, Kyle, listen.  Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.
Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?
Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it!
Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker.
Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself!  Come on, Butters, we're going!
Hello. Hello, polie. Hello, polie hurrah you soldier boy. Hey, soldier boy!
Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you! 
He's the guy who writesÂ Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
There you are! Where have you been? We have another anti-American video to create! 
Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm.
At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble!
Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!
I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!
Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!
You're helping Craig make his show?! I can't believe you would betray us like that! We've always been supercool to you! 
"Hahahahahaaahaaa! We're gonna do a news show, and you can't do it with us, because you are too poo-oor, and poor people don't watch the new-oos! Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!"
Ah whatever, Kenny! 
I'm doing some sweet bun-sow moves.  I'm a little better than everyone else here.
Well. To think all this time I'm actually a Naive American.
Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense.
Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch. 
Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way. 
I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus.
Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir! 
I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us.  "Oh, thank you, guys." You're welcome, Kenny.
All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly.  Oh jeez, no, no, I can't hide you all.  I'm sorry, you'll just have to find somewhere else to-  Well, I suppose I'll get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on. 
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Uheheheh, heh.
The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look.  There, okay. Let's see here.  Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?
The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih! 
I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father.
You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.
Ugh. Oh, I know.  We can use Wacky Water Weasel! 
Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want!
I don't know, I just knew it.  Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?!
Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!  Die! 
Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here.  Look that way, make sure the cashier doesn't see me.  Is anybody coming?
We found a Etheropian, can we keep him?
You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich!
Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!  Mom, can I watch American Gladiators?
Hey! Hey, what is this?! Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you do this to me, God? Next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? 'Cause I like to get lubed before I get FUCKED! Huh?! Some lube would be nice! Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick next time you decide to FUCK me! 
Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television?! 
Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call.  Gebaayybeh!  Gebaayybeh!
I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that?  You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper.
You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers!
That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.
...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek. 
Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.
Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants.
You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until-  God-damnit!  Hey! Merry Christmas, asshole! 
Oh, are you gonna take us to your little pussy house?
Looks like I've come to the right place.
This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life! 
Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat.  Ah, sweet! The Red Cross!  I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please.
That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.
That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized!
Well, come on guys. We gave it our best. 
Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?
There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves.
You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!
My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic.
Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies
Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?
How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?
It isn't fair!  You goddamned assholes, it isn't fair! 
They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! 
It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.
So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!
Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-
And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred.
Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys! 
We've got about ten minutes before this entire country is up in flames! If you wanna live, you'd better step on the gas! Oh wait, is this a Tesla? Shit! Well press on the prissy pedal! We're gonna die!! 
Is there anything else I can get for you?
Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures.
I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice.  We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties.  Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.
Hey,  that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there. 
Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew!
We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.
Hope you have a good one. See you later. 
What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?!
Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them.
Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?!  Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore!
You're welcome!! Now leave us alone!!  My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and exterminate them!
Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it?
Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor.
I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.
All Jews carry gold in a little bag around their necks! Hand it over!
Yes. I will be your new best friend.
Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.
There is a crisis in America. and we have to save our living rooms. Our living rooms are dying.
Shut your God-damned mouth
or else I'm... gonna... kick you
square in the balls... ass-hole
Aw, damn it! 
Did somebody say "catch a Jew"? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS.
You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.
You have... sexually harassed me for the last time! It says right here... that now I can sue you and take all of your money.
You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.
Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg!
Stan? I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Be sure to watch. 
Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back. 
Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?
Hey, I don't have to take that kind of crap from you scrawny weaklings!  Eh, eh. Sweet. Check me out, I'm such a beefcake I can't even get through the door. Eh.
I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around.
Good-bye Mr. Hankey!  Bring me lots of presents!  I always believed in you!
Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door!
What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool!  You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!
Slowly the rage built inside his mind.  "Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!" His only solution became obvious: Kill her!
We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth is going out with that...Richard Greco guy that used to be on 21 Jump Street but then he got his own show for just a little while- 
Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER! 
They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. 
That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776. 
Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?!  Oh yeah! She's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls, but she's dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! Stan-an's a gir-rl! You'd better curb your dog, Stan! You'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you! 
Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it.
Oh, okay.I guess I understand. 'I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...''I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...
I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!
No! Dude, I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I'm gonna-Â Â Hey, hang on a second, Lawrence.Â Â I think we have a Nosey Nancy in the room.Â Â Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. If I'm gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, then I'm gonna need something better than Twitter.
Aww, my mom is so poor she walked down the road with one shoooe.  And if you ask her if she lost a shoe, she'd say "No, I found ooone."
If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed! 
Herr Kommandant Cartman has ways of making you talk! 
Don't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunate! Follow me!  You guys, come on! Right now! 
Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the coolest.  God damnit, there's no more Pengins!  Kenny, Pengin is my favorite. That's the last one. Let me have it. 
Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?
Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination work to do! 
Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen, okay. We were both at my house all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail! 
Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle!
Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome!
Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!  What the fuck are you doing?!  Kyle, stop it!  God damn it, don't!  Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone!  NO!!  AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle!  Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND!  I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you!
The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on! 
Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen. 
Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.
Look: If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?!
Oh, man, I wish I knew how to spell.
Alright, football night, what do you do?
Get out your camera and a boobie or two.
Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter. 
I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange.  You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts.
Wha-? Uh oo  why do you want then back so much?
Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott.  Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good. 
No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.
I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?
Yeah-uh, Token! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!
I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do!  Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit.
I think... you and I might be able to help each other here today.
Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules.
D-don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together.
Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.
Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve.  But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear.
Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!
Would you like sauerkraut, German boy, German boy?Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut, FrÃ¤ulein Setski 
You just rest, Kyle.  Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry-  but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle?  What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream,  let's see
That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long.
I'm not talking to him, because he's a dirty thief.
Hooray!  Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly.
See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.
Will somebody take those books away from him?
The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!
Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the fuck do you think you are?!
Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia.
What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!
Would you like to touch my body?
Come on and touch my body!
Oooo, my hot body!
Don't you like my hot body?
Come on and touch my titties!
I felt them just like?
Come on Justin, touch my body!
Mmm, Justin, yeah!
Touch my body! You and me!
Check it out, my not-hot body!
Come on, my body!
Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! 
Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know.
Ahem, how's it going brahs? This isÂ CartmaaanBrah!
Sweet. I think we're next in line now.
Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that needs to be sucked out, please.
Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again!
People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!
Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for sure.
Yes. The fireman is very magical. If you rub his helmet, he spits in your eye. 
No, that's not that funny. Let's try something else.
I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God.  He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously.
Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.
Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!!  And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!!  They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep
Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!
Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!
Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?  God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like "I touched penises with my cousin!"  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle.
Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!
I wonder when the monster is gonna come back to feed again? 
Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!
All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this "Women Who Run With The Wolves" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers.
That asshole is not getting across my border! 
Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here.
Oh yeah?! I roam with twelve gangs! And we only commit hate crimes! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt! 
O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!
Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time.
Man, that is the gayest dog I've ever seen.
Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever.
Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants!
Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity.
Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind. 
Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead!
All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -
Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?
Hah!  It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday!  Only three more days till Casa Bonita.  Oh, that would be so bad-ass!
"Coming in for attack, Captain." Pipew, pipipew  Give me the space cruiser, Kenny.
Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like "No no, the fight hasn't started yet," and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair.
Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home.
Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go!  Oh my God! 
Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster.  But you're my little monster.
Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...
UhâWould you stop going on about your little brother? I know it was just a dream, I know I didn't have an anal probe, and I know that I'm not under alien control! 
I love to singa
About the moona and June-a and the springa
I love to singa
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a...
We can't let her get away with this!  I think tonight we need to do something drastic.
Cool.  Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle!  Who are you?
There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we-  got.
Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. 
It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.
Maybe- maybe he's still okay.  No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your-
All right men, rally up! There's still a Mexican out there and he ain't gettin' through!  You haven't won yet!  Game on!
And a one, and a two, and a- 
Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food.
Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.
Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo.  Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.
Hunh.  Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA.
...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities?
It is fried chicken!  Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae.
Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny! 
How the hell was that a strike?!  Goddamnit, he's going to first!
Huh?  Oh, no, you sons of bitches! Aww, sons of bitches..! 
Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA!  That son of a bitch!
What the hell?!  Mom? Mom, my room is...  AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!
Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?
What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.
You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag.  My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool. 
Sweet. Now, I'm gonna go kill those guys!
No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  There we go.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?
"Nobody's gonna notice"?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?! 
Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time.  When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- 
Mom! Seriously! Let's go to the toy store, Mom. Now! Must go! Toy store!
Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry!
Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!
Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. 
Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere.  Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?  Well, screw you too!  What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?! 
Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister.  You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die.
Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom?
Awww, sweet!  No way, this is so tits!
The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office.
Billy Mays? Billy Mays?!  Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays!
Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.
Alright lads! Go home and write your farewell letters to your families! The land of pirates awaits! 
You aren't listing to anythin-  Make it worth my while how?
God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps?
Oh, so that's where all my underpants go.
Why can't we just read the paper we wrote last time?
No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig!  You leave Fluffy out of this!
It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!
Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers.
Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-
Kyle, Kyle!  I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were sent to concentration camps.
Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there were... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.
And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!
And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, "Do you smell lemon grass?", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there.
Get it!  Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive! 
Uh- chair. C H A R E  God damnit, how come I get the hard ones?!  Get over here, you son of a bitch Fonics Monkey!
I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.
I'm gonna go jam my thumb in some'in's butthole now.
It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in America, so we brought it back to your crappy country. 
Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog.
So who do we throw the party for?
You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! 
There are too many minorities (too many)
At my water park (somebody do something).
Where did they all come from?
Why canât they leave this land alone?
And itâs such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying).
We looked the other way too long.
Weâve got to change our priorities
And get all these minorities
Out of my water park
(Minorities) Mexicans and Asians,
(Black people), I think I even saw a Native American (gross).
God Iâm asking please, get all of these minorities
Out of my water park (my water park).
Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.
Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!
YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay!
Cause I'm not (I'm not) the poor kid at school!  
Let's hear it for Jacob Hallery, guys! 
His mom is so poor she cuts coupons out to be institutionalized!
Greeley Colorado's the place to be!
It's a whole new beginning for you and me!
Life can only get better 'cause I know one simple ruuule!
I'm not (he's not) the poor kid at school!
Well, I'm going to Spooky Laboratory!  Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells...
Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency.
Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.
Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee!  Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while.  Oh, psych! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool!
Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens?
I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?
Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him.
Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.
This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew.  Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.
So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?
Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge.
Whoa, look at Bebe!Â Â I had no idea Bebe was that hot.
That does it! Wait right here!  Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make semen come out of your body.
I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home!
Yeah, I'll see you around.  Sure is too bad about my grandma, though...
Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?
Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down!  Well it's on! We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW! 
Hey! The white man has marred my people long enough! You keep your God-damned mouth shut!  Stan, I need your bike in order to ride over to the reservation.
So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.
There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know.  The blood is washed neatly from our hands. 
Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go!
Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this!  Oh my God, you guys, seriously!  Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich!  Aren't you stoked?!
Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!
Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party.
Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters.
All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in!
So... you don't like Family Guy either, huh?
Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?
These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!
Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?
That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.
No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?
It's raining frogggggsss!  Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs?
Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters...
This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys. 
No! No I'm fine!  I just need to get home, a-and rest.
What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well.
No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it.  Sweeeeeeeeeet!
Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. 
I get by. Let's see, I'm gonna need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings.
I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone!  What did you do with my picture?!
No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!
Wait. I remember. It was the red button! 
That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig.  Cause its poop is small.
Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said "shit" on television!
Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.
Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage! 
Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think.  Do you see anything?
Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah. 
Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.
So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times.  Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a "What Would Jesus Do" bracelet!
Guys, meeting over here for a second?  All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard.
Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!
Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts  and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade.
Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. today. I have to be the first to get one!  Come on! 
Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends ; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now.
God damnit!  Shut up, Kitty!  Any problems, contact Eric's Mommy at 303... Aha!  I'm gonna call mom and tell her that the babysitter is having her boyfriend come over! Then we'll see who's the turd! 
'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!
Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig. 
My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us! 
Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose.  Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof.  "Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous!" 
My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool.
Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did.
Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?!
Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here.
Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumbass European hippie piece of crap. 
So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb. 
Nothing. Now, sir, is there some kind of a...
Shu- shut up you guys, shut up you guys. 
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
Poopin' outside,
Makin' self-serve ice cream
For my friends
Specially Kenny.
Hey, Kenny, Can I borrow one of your gloves?
All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters. 
How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?
Token, look away to the right.  More.  More!
Aha, charade you are! Looks like you're the turd now!
Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor.
Al-righty then. Let's get to my presents, shall we?
Uh oh.  Crap, they called the cops on us.
So who put his who-who-dilly in your cha-cha?
You can't just "hit" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it!  Shut you butthole, or I'll kick your ass, you fuckin' drum!!  That's how you rock, dude.
The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface.
You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you.
You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that.
That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine.  Inside the red line is, that's- that's my ground. He was on it. 
Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five.  How about five bucks?
What the hell?  Kenny, get out of here!
He is my friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were,  and I hoowi-  Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!
Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to.  Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!
My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money.
We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.
You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.
Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!
No, not with my eyes. With these!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea
Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is.
Yeah, I know dude. I'm telling you, it was the worst pain in my entire life.
Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample. 
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
Dude, when my mom finds out that my babysitters have their boyfriends over, she mostly gets really mad, mostly.  Yaaah. Eeyy! Ey, God damnit!
"SORRY"?! YOU GAVE ME AIDS AND YOU'RE "SORRY"?!
Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal!
Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?!
Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!
So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China.
At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!
Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?
I'm going to kill you one day, Token.
Hello? ...BHI records? ...Oh, it's for you, Ms. Lopez. 
Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle!
Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don't like the peanut-butter filled one.
Eric.
Dude! That is Craig's mom's bush right there! Wait, wait what's that?Â Â Oh shit, dude! Bail! Bail!Â 
Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!
What kind of smartass thing would I say, Mr. Garrison?
So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did?  Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. . Kyle!
He said you kissed her with your tongue.
Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? 
Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business.
Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.
For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.
I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.
Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy.  Mm-yummy you guys!  Yuppitibut, that's all, folks! 
Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.
That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him!
Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle?
You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?
Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open!
I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!
HA!  For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer.  This first picture I like to call "Moods of Winter" , a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?
Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now!  We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come on! Come on!!  Mooooooom! Moooooooom!
Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested.  Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!
Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask  and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof. 
Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. 
Oh no! Nononononono! Sorry, Wendy, this tryouts for a boy band! 
Guys, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure!  For that is the way of the--
Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating.
Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass!
I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.
Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.
Don't you touch him! Leave him alone!  Peter Panda!
I know, I know! 
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right
Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.
Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin.
Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go.
Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?!
Aw dude, look, there's Craig! Heheh.Â Â Craig's mom is taking off her clothes.
Heh, four dollars for a goat? We got ripped off.
Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come.
Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as you can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead.
Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti! You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives.
Full cheeks!  Winking brown eye, brown eye winking! 
And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too.
Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!
Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. 
Kevin, Jesus Christ!  Hard to starboard, lads! There's sure to be lots of booties out hyah!  Clyde, the fuck?!
Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys!  I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!
The city isn't what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went to crap. It's like... everyone's sense of morals just... disappeared. Bad economy made things worse.  The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down.  Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things.  He didn't.  As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs protection.  There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage.  To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man.  I'm the hero this town needs. I am...  the Coon!  As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact. 
Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me.
Please, you guys, I don't know what to do!
I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?!  Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow. 
Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall.  So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it--
Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?
Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you...  you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved. 
On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together!Â Â ...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive.
I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!
Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.
Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him. 
This picture I like to call "The Pierre". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha.  And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth.  I call this picture "The Sleeping Menstrual".  This one, I call "Hot Fudge Mondae".  I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.
Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?
Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo-  sh, sh sh sh sh. Here he comes, here he comes.  Heya, Craig, your uh... your family get you that jacket at Walmart or Kmart? 
Deah, eh eh.  Oh man, what a weird dream!
We're trying to raise money for our friend, Chef.  Would you like a Moon Crunchie or a Snacky Cake?
Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half.
Clyde, Clyde? Did you see that?  Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too.
He's from Jersey, you guys.  Let's just get away from him.
Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!
Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there.
What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!
All right, did you write the four essays?
Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!
Whatever it is, it's getting closer.  Ow! What the hell was that for!
Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.
Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.
You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that-  Motherfucker!
All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever.  "Cartman's Passover Holiday Special", starring, THE JEWPACABRA! 
No.  NOOO!  CLYDE FROG!!  They took Clyde Frog! 
So, it appears that you need me. Which is good, because... I need you, too.  Ringy-ding?
Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!
KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMIDS!
Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!
Son of a bitch!  Oh no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time!
No! But I don't... ah... ah...  Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back.
I'm gonna be home-schooled, and leave all the pain and suffering of public school behind me! Screw you guys, I'm a-gonna be home-schooled! 
What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!
Dude... Token!  Token. Dude.  Psst. Token.  Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Token! Yeah, get in there.
Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike.
Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here. 
It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.
Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine. 
Oh, I've got a better idea! Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms?! Because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me, Mom!
OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME!  What the-?
Whoa! Heheh.  Whoa!  Whoa! Heheheheheh.  Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the-uum, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh.
Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here? 
I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.
Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that. 
Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say.
Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's.
Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this. 
Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework,  gave me the soda from his lunch.  I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East.  Right, Kyle? 
Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy
It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now!
I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.
Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack.
I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. 
Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!
I told you guys! Here it is, right here. "The brown noise."
No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore.
Well, let's see... Maybe 'cause he's an old, drunk hillbilly dick!
I do! I do care! Look how much.  Look. Look how much I care. 
All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.
It is?  Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! 
He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen.  Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! 
That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.
We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.
Well, there's everything, Butters.  I've made everything right.
Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants.  Ow!
T, H. "Th." There. Hey, this is easy!  I'm gonna win the spelling bee for sure, Mom!
That's the proper way to say it, or else you get a spanking.
Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was  smacked down by the Lord-uh!  God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh!  But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides,  so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya  to this part hmya.  Who will help us?
It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't stay here, or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom.
Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was.
Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?
We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade
We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice
Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles
The world seemed to all make sense
but that sense seems to slowly fade
After Third Grade
In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons
We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue
We had warm cookies and hearts full of love
And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you...
There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute
To Third Grade
It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded.  I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?
If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?
Well.  Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it.
I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet. 
And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we can sell your fetus to companies like Alder Labs.
Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a  Sega Dreamcast?
What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.
What-evah. I digitally put Jabba the Hutt back into the original Star Wars movie! I'll do what I waunt!
Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?
No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes.
GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! 
I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!!  It's wrong! 
I brought it up because you already brought it up!
Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails?
I'm fahn. Just a lit-  No big deal.  Beh.
Puh-I know, dude. Pete Melman crapped his pants. So freakin' funny! 
Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!
Yes, and no time to do it. No time... 
Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les MisÃ©rables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks.
Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?
We'll go to LA with your wife. All she has to do is go on the show, do all the performing, make all the money, and leave the rest to us. 
Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday.
You see, in America we have... log rides!  Bacon double-cheeseburgers!  Sheep-shearing contests!
He stuttered like a bitch! I've got this job in the bag!  Who are you?
The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards.
HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!
Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!
It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.
Stan, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you. 
It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome.  I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do! 
Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp! 
Well, I'm out guys.  If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends.
Because, Butters, Kyle was spying on us, okay-Â Â Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video.
We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh!  If thy hand offend thee, cut it off!  It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-
Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih.
Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too.
You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.
All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access.
For oth-er...  Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later?
This kicks ass, you guys! John Elway is my father! 
My father is John Elway, my father is John Elway
Deedun, Deedun.
Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.
God damnit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip. 
It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters.
You are all very bad kitties! That is a bad, bad kitty!
Well, I don't see any crocs out here.
Including the late and very talented Billy Mays!
Did he say "the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world"?
Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before.
Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?
Just get rid of it Butters! Don't tell me where you spend it and don't ever let me have it back.  From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.
We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.
...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.
You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!
Yeah. I didn't wanna do it, Jesus. They made me do that.
Oh, then you won't mind if I take it! 
Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.
You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick! 
That's right.  Guys with Cash For gold Signs gets you People's Unwanted Crappy Jewelry, which when added to a Cable-Based Shopping Network divided by Demented Old people equals Gold. 
That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended!  Yeahhh.  Mmm yeah, you like that?  All right, Clyde, you're first! Get up here!  Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde. 
Look, I have to have one of those phones!
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life.
Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive animal lover. He's got a boner for this goat, a-
All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back.  Melita! Melita, hold on.  You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?
Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed...  in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room.  Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open,  and the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway.  Then I was lying on a table,  and these scary hands wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes...
It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse.  Just back off, man!
Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough.
Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle.
I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. "Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."
Hey dudes, what's goin' on?  How is everything with you guys?
No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.
...Should that really matter at a time like this?
IT ISN'T OVER!!  It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!
Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts?
Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out.
"Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?"
Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew!
Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!
Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future. 
Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!
Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!
Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!!  Dowww!
We're all gonna need a lot more calamine lotion.
Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps?
No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.
Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares! 
Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.
Let's see. I want that Clown Criminy game , and that Power Jim doll.  And, let's see...  Do you really like this remote-controlled truck?
Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?
Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face.
We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!
Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey!  What the hell is that?
Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece?
Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! i'm walking out and I'm never coming back! 
Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?
Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education.
Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like.
Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there?
Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.
What's wrong?  Has he been checked for bombs?
Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you!  Uh sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are!
Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.
My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine.
Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ??
Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh.  It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh.  He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish.
No on, come on, let's read it now!
Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.  Haha, hahahaha! 
No, Kenny, you can't look, I'm the foreman!
They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to give it to them.
Haha! Stupid assholes! I got your time phone! 
And my friend Kyle has - a dad, and my friend Kenny has a dad?
We're trying to find the brown noiseâit's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.
We're in fourth grade, Jimmy. We don't even know what ethical means.
So please, everyone, From now on you've got to try and watch your language. 
I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice...  is the justice you take.  Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls. 
Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh.  Here you go, God-damnit!
All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. 
That's what they're called, dude. Get with the times.Â 
Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!
What did I tell you, Butters? This is the good life, huh?  What's going on?
You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of ThronesÂ him by making powerful alliances.
Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit!  To arms!  Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an enire pirate crew willing to do anything for me!
Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet-
Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck! 
Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat.
The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right?
What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon?  Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse?
Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. Fly fly fly...
No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.
Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.
We just received a letter from the WWE.
Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.
Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.
Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math.
No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something.
What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!
I need to get stupid, Butters. I'm getting all the blood to rush to my head and watchin' a marathon of Two and a Half Men.
Interesting, and why is it called Passover again? 
How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? 
You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf.
All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny?  What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle?  I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right. 
Okay, be a Jew. We're gonna go play laser tag. 
Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it. 
Day is never finished, Massa got me working... Oh, look, I found another one  Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle! 
Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass! 
Hey, dick-whore. I guess you saw the commercial, too.
Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!
You mean to tell me I could never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?!
He's my evil twin? But he doesn't even look that much like me; he's all fat and stuff. He's hella lying.
No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback.
Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today.
Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know.
Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter!
It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.
What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?
Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch!
A clubhouse? Heheh, that's the lamest thing I've ever heard!
You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents!
Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle, of it, Kyle, of it Kyle...
Look at me, livin' free
Free and clean amongst the Sea People
''We look for pirates and search for gold.
Life is an adventure with the Sea People
They don't ever complain, they don't call me fat.
They don't make me do homework or nothin' like that.
This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing,
Sea people and me.
Sea people and me, you guys.
Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars. 
Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style!
Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right.Â Â Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security?
Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm home. 
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN, EH! NOW I CAN'T MAKE THE ULTRA MEGA MEGA MAN, YOU DIRTY CHEAP-ASS PIECE OF CRAP! 
No I can't; I'll always be like this. 
Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck. 
Yeah, I love these Salty Chocolate Balls, Chef. 
Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!
Ten dollar? Eight dollar? You give me eight dollar, soldier boy!
Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it's tough, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.
Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news.  I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow.
Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy! 
I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! 
That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.
Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.
Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him.
You don't have a TV show anymore, Captain, so you can just suck my Japanese-imprisoned balls! 
I'm in a Japanese prison Lawd. 
Japanese balls got me down.
Look at his lip.  You've got herpes, dude.
Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?
Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second.  Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2  stand just a little bit more over...  here.  Let's see, maybe a little more up in here.  And just a wee bit over here.  And right about...  hm'ere.  There we go. Good. 
Oh I hate this stupid Christmas poo.  Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas to you!
"The next zipline? What are you talking about?"
I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, "Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!" 
Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo. 
...But Mo-o-om, I have to get the first one, or else people won't think I'm coo-oo-ool!
Hey you guys, when I'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want.
Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can't expect people to want to watch. Okay?  All right.
Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay!
No, that was a jakovasaur. It's okay to come in. 
No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being "mys-teriously" arrested, huh?! 
Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt!  I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
You know how my friend Stan, has... a dad?
I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off.
You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?
I know. Ah I know you don't like me back. I ju- Yeah, you know, the- this was stupid, I'm sorry. Will you just take a cupcake?  Oh, don't take the cupc- I, I'm sorry. I, I'm sorry I wasted your time. 
Beth! Bear-mace that guy!  Let's check out the rooms! Leeroy and Kyle go that way! Beth, you come with me!
Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live.
Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding.
How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves.
Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!
Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that.
Hey, everyone? Excuse me!  Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up.  Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle.
Oh no? Don't you remember the time he went crazy, and tried to kill Kathie Lee Gifford?
I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig!
It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be soo stoked. It's the best surprise ever!
If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face!  Well any God damned second, Kyle!
Come on!  Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry up in there?! 
What are you gonna do, Kyle?! Tell on me?!  Then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale!  Is that really how you deal with your problems?! Grow up, Kyle!  All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is.
Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!
Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle.
You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O.
Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.
Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible.  I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit.  Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. 
Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous!
What are you supposed to be Stan, Howdy Doody?
All right, let's try over here.  Set up traps there, and there as well.  Last time I saw him he ran right through here. 
Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear?
Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again.
One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters!  Don't come any closer! We have information that that we will only trust with the President of the United States!
Takin' a look here.  Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five.
You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!
Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.
Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!
Now, are you a team player or not?!
No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!
There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!
Well hello. Another person who  cares about the future of our school?
I am studying, Mom. I'm learning with the Fonics Monkey. 
No no, no no, nono no!Nonono, no no!
Two percent, have my penis cut off.  Two percent-
Oh, that's so sweet you guys.  You wanna go get a room so you can make out for a while? Heheheheheh 
You seen this woman, brah?  She's staying here!
Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means.
AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! Rumpertumskin!! RUMPER  Rumpertumskin... WHY? Why did you do this??
Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! 
Even 10% is good enough. Here you go.Â 
Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!
I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down! 
What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.
Well, you can see here that we raised approximately $95, falling well short of our $2 million goal illustrated here.
Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again.
You're just gonna have to deal with that.
That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways.  Hall pass! Show me your hall pass!
All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten.  If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out.  Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay?
I will do the German dance for youIt's fun and gay and tra-la-la I hope my will enjoy my dance Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay
Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches. 
Mom, mom! You wanna see what I want for Christmas?
We drill.  I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. They pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside.
I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.
I don't wanna die on this- bus with you assholes!  You guys suck!
I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
Weight Gain 4000, it's helping me bulk up.
Oh come on! We're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You think, you think Kyle isn't on the computer right now tryin' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gonna have such a field day, that heartless Jew!  Well I won't give him the satisfaction!
No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there!
Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming.  I know that you are all deeply troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman once and for all!  Yes, Clyde!
No! The Chinese, no! Somebody has to stop them!  No! No!
Pass me the ball!  Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole!  Kyle, what the F?!
Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass.
I'm not pickin' it ma! God damn it, I have an itch! 
They're gonna... take over the world! HAA!  Too many of them.  No! Leave us alone!  Nooo!  Damn it no! No!
Yeah Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back.Â Â Are you heading back Butters?Â Â Butters?Â Â Alright Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid.
Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed.
How do you feel? Do you feel okay?
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, "Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."
All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?
Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled! 
Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??
Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?
Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks.
Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach!  Oh, God! You guys are such pussies!  Hemmm...
Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now! 
No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!
Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?
All right, now everyone back over there!  We'll start with what I already know. 
Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first.
Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve?
Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?
Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them.
Ugh.  Just remember the song "Can't Touch This" and you'll remember the code word!
It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!
O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?
Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!
Welcome to our offices, Token. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm?  Come on over this way, Token.  Guys, you remember Token. He's thinking about becoming a client.
No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!
We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!
Eh but, but this doesn't make sense to me, Marty! Okay, you told me the movie made a lot of money!
Look! There's an old refrigerator!  Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!
I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder!
Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms.Â 
Could you please use it in a sentence?
I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.
Hey, everybody! Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides , six roller coasters , and tons of great surprises!  And the best part is:  You can't come!!  That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister , a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow!  It's the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!!  So come on down to Cartmanland now!  But don't plan on getting past the parking lot,  'cause remember:  So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come!  Especially you, Stan and Kyle.
Jesus loves me this I know
'Cause Republicans tell me so
Little ones God will protect
'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect
Everything still clear out there?
It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium!
Right Butters.Â Â These guys are so dumb, huh?
...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!
Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.
Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment onÂ Call Of Duty.
Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.
Oh heell now!  Mom! Dad's being mean to me! Mem! MEEM! 
Mom, can you get me some Weight Gain 4000?
That's Kyle the Jew again, talking aboutÂ Call Of DutyÂ to Stan.
Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now.  And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy. Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS? 
Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all.  It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! 
Thank you, Mrs. Garrison.  My speech is entitled "Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles."  We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids.  Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles.  Aw, nasty! Yuck!  This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls.
Noooo...  Trying to find a job will be even harder.
Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them. 
I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills.
...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. 
Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy.  There. Yeahm.
Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.
' No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just- uh.  Oh man.
Can I have the yellow with a side of white?
Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me.
Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy.
Hengh!  Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS!  Hengh!
Egh. God damn it!  Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig.
Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle.
How are we gonna get it from him?
Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence.
Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage.  I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny!  I'm talking to you Kenny, achtung!  Poor piece of crap.
The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere!  Don't you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my God!  You guys! YOU GUYS!!
Out of the way. Out of the way please. 
That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long!  What?
I'm not sure of anything anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.
Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's fifty percent rise in one, year!
Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch.
Uh, it's nice to meet you, Kyle. I can certainly tell you're a relative of my good friend Kyle here. 
Well then, perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population!
All right you guys, I know what we have to do.  We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker.
God-dammit, how long is this goin' to take?
Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park...
Oh yeah, you're right.  Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don't want all that, why don't you share it with me, man?  Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here...
And girl, you know that you're the only girl for me, girl
Girl, you're the girl of my fantasy
You're my girl, you're my girl
You can't hit me! Didn't you see those nanny videos on TV? 
He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night!
What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about?
Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland. 
Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11.
Ey! What the hell is wrong with you people?!
It's all right. You've got it, no problem-  OP.
You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility.  Ow..
It's going to rhyme, Token, just hold on.
I was not the shooter. I was not the gun.
So Token, you should be cool while we're all here at school.
Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moooommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars? 
You're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please!
You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius!
There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real.  Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah.  Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real?  I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?
No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh? 
It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC. 
We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?
Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch.
I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.
Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and "filled the gap." 
Butters.  You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?
You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I"M NOT ALL RIGHT!!
I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez.
Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself.  That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool.
Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?
Oh, you guys sure are going a long ways to try and scare me. I want my Salisbury steak!
I don't care. I'm supposed to sit here and do my homework.
Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, "Poopypants Pete", but th- but then I also thought of "Mushpants Melman."
Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: "Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches"!  Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast!
So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!
You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away.  I'm going to go sign up now.
Oh my God, and you can hear me??
I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog.  Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog!  I can meet new friends on the Internet!  Here's a chat room: "Men Who Like Young Boys"  That's perfect.  Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li-  Wow! Look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316.  Hi Tony.  "So what are you into?"  Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face.  "Kewl. Wanna get together?  Smiley-face?"  Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face.  "Meet me at Mel's Buffet restaurant tomorrow morning."  Sounds good. See you then! Clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face.  You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend!
Come on! The cameras are ready!  Alright, there we go. Let's roll cameras.  Oh, and here's your microphone. 
Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here right now!
Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob.
Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?
Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable!
Well, there's a whole crappy band here!  Can you hear them? Here. Can you hear them? 
Ye-ah, screw those guys. I don't even like them.
I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', "Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!"
Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first.  Goddamnit!
Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out.
If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom. 
What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay?
Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!
And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, "Whoa, I'm back."Â Â Damn it if it's not the awesomest thing ever!
Yeah yeah, I'm showin' the guys!  Check it out. Eavesdropper got a hold of the phone call from the nurse to Pete Melman's mom.  Just listen, listen listen.
I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.
God Damnit, would you shut the hell up?!  Nobody gives a rat's ass.
Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!!  Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh.  Just- okay  No.  Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh. 
What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!
Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy!  Aaah!
Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.
Mmmm! Tastes like chicken. The ass of a chicken!
Kenny? Kenny?  Kenny?  Wanna look at Playboy?  Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?
Well well well, here he comes. It's BJ McKay and his best friend Bear.
Dude! That is not cool! Choppin' off wee wees is not cool!
Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.
That's right you will, God-Damnit.  Move it POVs, I'm an American!
So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?
The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!
Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!
So, how can Mr. Hankey be here, and in another mall at the same time?
Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys.
A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots & Ladders game used only three times, DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase of any deluxe hamburger at Red Robin.  All this can be yours. 
I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will have his nuts!
Hey you guys. I know a scary story.
Yeah, listen, I'm running a retail business, but I can't get enough of people's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I'd like to buy some of yours.
Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!
Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million dollars. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean,  I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know? 
Who the hell cares what it's called, as long as she doesn't have to touch me.
You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!
Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST!
It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude.
Oh my God you guys, look at this!  Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling.  Holy hell yes!
What? What do you mean I know that?
Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?
I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "You-hoo"...
I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler.  Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh?  He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!
She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it.
And where... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey?
We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow!  Get the lead out!
We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.
Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.
Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men?
That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! You'd better watch out, you'd better not cryâ
Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.
Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?
...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.
Mmm. I can't possibly finish this whole cake. Oh, yes I can. 
Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?
Oh, I didn't think you were coming, Stan.
What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles?  Am I to understand there will be no side dishes?
Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right?  Cool. 
Oh cool! I got a racing game for Xbox!  D'you guys see that? Coool, huh?
Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!
Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass. 
D'you know what you are? You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say "That's the bad guy!" Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!
Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn! Oh, for the love of God, how much longer?! 
Of course we know what a queef is, you queef!
Doctor, can you tell me exactly how stem cells work?
It's not gonna be okay because now I'm a whistleblower, and against my conscience I'm gonna have to hide out in Russiaaaa!Â 
Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.
Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master!
No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?! 
I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.
This is gonna be the best version of the Miracle Worker ever!
By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge.
Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall!
The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us!
Well ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch.
Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!
Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him?
Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield. 
Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas. 
Well, you... could make them... go away for a while.
Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one. 
We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.
I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet!Â 
Kyle! Hey, Kyle!  I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance.
You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media!  I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! 
Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!
I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom.
Okay, that does it!  Screw this, I'm goin home!  Talking poo is where I draw the line!
Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke!
And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. 
Take that, Jimmy!  And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again!  Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?!  Oh, Kyle. Hey.
Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!
Are we sure about this? We'll never know the future.
Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class.
A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.
No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves.
No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out.
Oh my God! Come on, you guys, come look at this!
You're my dad, Chef. Chief Running Water said - you got together with my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance.
Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom.
Did you see that? Token was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead. 
Well, I'm a badass cowboy living in a cowboy's
Age wicky wicky scratch yo yo bang bang
Me and Artemus Clyde Frog go save
Salma Hayek from the big metal spider
Wicky wicky wick, wicky wicky wick, Fresh
Cowboy from the Westside-
Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. 
Mel! Gibson!  Oh mein Savior! Mein FÃ¼hrer! You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding!  Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?!
Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!! 
Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!
I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do!
Dammit! Tell me who my father is already!
Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys!  You guys, please don't tell anybody.
Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us. 
...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!
Hey! You guys are screwin' up the song! 
You ready?  Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say,  "Shit."
Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an "A-"?
Well you know, it's a...  H-ho, awesome! 'Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.'With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of bricks.'What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me'I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously.'Seriously hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.
I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!
Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!
Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice.
Who's there?!  Lock that door behind you, Token.  Black people live here! 
Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!
Yaaaay!  Oh cool, look. A Ben 10 Wrist Rocket! This is exactly what I wanted for Stan's birthday! What'd you get Stan?
Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!
I won't do it! He used to be my friend!
You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.
We represent Token.  Give us a call, we'll work out a deal.
No! No, he has to suck my balls!  NO! KYYYYLE! 
Mobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die!
And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch.
Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?!  His family's totally poor; I'm not staying with poor people!  All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man.
Dude, check it out: for picture day, Kenny got into his parka backwards, so that his ass shows through his hood. Look! . Kenny, Kenny, over here! 
Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! 
Nononono! Me h'myah , you guys myah!  â maybe a little mo down, down in hyah.  SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME. 
Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom! 
Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now.
Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington
I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.
Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.
Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you.
And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?!
Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters.  Well, let's get going, shall we?
A merger?! It's too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don't have a company! We don't have anything! 
Something he said. Did you hear him? He said "Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!"
I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers.  And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, "I'm not getting away with this, am I?" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just-
Did you not see Erica Smith's boobs, Kyle? They're like perfect water balloons.
Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake! 
Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!
Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse!
What?! Aw, God damn it!  Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha.
Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over!
Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!
It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!
No! Hold on a second!  I have a contract  validated by the United States court system!
Number seventeen step forward, please?  You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant. You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parrents died in the 9/11 attacks. Go!
Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way.
Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!
All right, now you can try to send this Bozo through and the whole mess'll be over with!
That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!
Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!
Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere!  Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! 
Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality.Â 
Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself!
I...  told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.
I'll never be able to prove that son of a bitch was here!  My Speak and Record bear. Of course.
Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.
Terrible!  I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me.
All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.
They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!
Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha.
Never mind him.  He's a very disturbed little boy.
He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and did what??
Ohohoh, totally, brah! So sweet. Being in charge of stuff rules!Â CartmaaanBrah!
It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!
I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?
It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.
Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?
Haaa hahaha! You guys are hella stupid! I knew you would fall for that!
Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.
Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.
Well that's fine! You can't call yourself "Washington Redskins!"
Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.
Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow!
Well if you get grounded in virtual reality you get grounded in real life too! For EVER!Â 
Kyle thought of it.Â Â Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin' sweet, dude!Â Â You're a fuckin' asshole!
You know, Stan, I'd say your dad racksa disciprine!
That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides!  Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared!  AAAGGGHHH....
Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!
Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.
Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth.  Hm?
City of Venice
Right by Matt's house
You can chill if you're homeless.
I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.
Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is...
No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He can't.
I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?!
Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.
Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep. 
Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see. 
I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded. 
Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair!
Alright cool, guys, gather all around. Everyone should be a witness to this.  Alright, you ready? Now say "I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me." Come on, dude, "I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me." 
Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be so funny!
Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?
Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left.
Hey fags, what's going on?  Dude, I was on the toilet all night from that chicken. I thought I was gonna die. 
Puhah! You guys don't follow Eavesdropper?   It's a Web site about all the students in the school! 
Get off of me, Christina Aguilera! Alright?! Please! Hegh, hegh
You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson.
Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR!
Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls bathroom a long time ago.
Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.
I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.
Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he's about to rape my mom.  Go go, she's upstairs.  Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white!
Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now.
Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!
But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!
No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene!
Lobster foam?  It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!
Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!
Black people say Hey hey hey!  Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! White people got you beat, black people; you'd better represent! Let me hear you say "I don't blame the white people. No no no!"
Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow!
O-kay! Let's see heuh. Haha! Um... Aw, damnit!  AAAAH! 
Hey Craig. Goin' on? Token! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-
Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. 
Let us get back to our work at the church.  Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah.  Hello?
Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here.
Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Foundig Fathers!
Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.
My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.
Yeah, calm down, calm down, you sons of bitches.
Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing!
This new song by Alanis Morissette. I canât get it out of my head.Stinky britches, you got stinky britches
I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done.  Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen.
Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game?  Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? 
Inspiration. Wait a minute,  that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?
You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world!
We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!
I was just thinkin' that... m-m-maybe we could... eat lunch together. I've always kind of...  liked you.
Oh my God! Jenny Simons crapped her pants!  Did you hear that?!  It's WAY worse than Pete Melman was!
Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!
It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!
I am trending so much that soon I will reach... trendscendence. Like Johnny Dep, but cool.
NO!  Oh God, oh God it's so good.
Wait a minute.  Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh!  There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken!
I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class? 
Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?! 
Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill.
And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.
Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away. I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper to be overThe ways of my Trap--
Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!
I'm just thinking out loud.  Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh?
Wweell, I might have been over at the Cheesy Poofs call-back, winning regional championship! 
Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy.
We were in a good mood, just jokin' around, you know, mostly making fun of Kenny's herpes.
Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?
Well, looks like nobody's home.  Guess we should come back some other time.
I'll eat my underwear, Wendy.  And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us.
All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?
No, I didn't do a damn thing! Nothing! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!
I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy. 
Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!
No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick!  ...Oh Jesus Christ.
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Say that to my face, pussy!
He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how?
No, it was just for a second!  What, what can I do? How how can I reverse this?
Family Guy is written by manatees?  Of course, it all makes sense now.
Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?
You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl!
Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!
Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.
Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! "Fuck you." Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with.  To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting.  Now when people hear the name "Redskins", they will immediately think "titties" and "balls". It's just a bold new way that we can say "We don't fucking care." Go Redskins! 
Ready. I will do the German dance for youIt's fun and gay and tra-la-laI hope my will enjoy my danceFiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ayWould you like some sauerkraut, German boy, German boy?Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut--
That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!
Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years.  Look! There's a library! A-and a temple! And a- who-?  Oh. They think I'm God.  Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?!  I am god of the sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!!  Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!
Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one.  Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes?
It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool.Â 
Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!
I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo.
Well, I'm pissed off!, Rick! How are you?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!
Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-
Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?
But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?
Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble!
All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.
No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu-  AAH!  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
But it was one of the best times I've ever had.
Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following theÂ Game of ThronesÂ model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.
It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.
You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. "There's no tooth fairy." I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh...  M- Mom?
Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?
Yeah, I canât get this stupid song out of my head.
Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays?
Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caughts, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. 
You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset.
I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek.
Why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom?!
Stop it now! Ugh-  No use, guys. He's got some sort of defense mechanism.
Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! 
Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them.
Agh! Careful, you assholes!  To the left, you guys, left.  No, camera left, camera left!  That's it, now down. 
And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process.
Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez.
Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we  all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion.
You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.   Why look, it's me. And...  And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? 
Oh, no! This is my Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early!
I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right?
Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.
Well, screw him, he's dead! Let's go look for crocodiles! 
Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.
You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!
There's bound to be some crocs up here. I'll use my croc call and try to bring 'em out. Brigeghus, brigeghus! Brig-!
I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.
Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?
Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything. 
And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.
No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu!
Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he hasâ¦
Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.
Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!
We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you.
Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it!  I'm pretty sure this occurs only rarely in nature! 
Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.
...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.  Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides.  Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again!  Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah-  What are you doing?
Well I'm glad you think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!
That's fine, just get it out of the way...
Well, I just, I kind of like having you around.
Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll!
No. Dude, I've seen this on TV. They shine that light in your face, and then they try to get you to tell them stuff by squeezing your balls really hard.
You guys?Â Â You guys, you'd better get over here.
Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right?
How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to  GET YOU BACK! 
Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?
How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle!  Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please. 
They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!
Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking?  The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day.  See ya later.
Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses.
The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power.
That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days!
The guy on TV who had incredible things for people to buy? He died four months ago but they still show his commercials all the time? Oh, oh for the love of Christ, here!  Here here! This, this is him!
Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire.  I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!!  I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate.
Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well.
What's wrong with me? Let's see. Uum.  I hate you guys. You're hella stupid.
Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!
God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! 
This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act!
Why Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Token and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are!  Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?!
I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.
Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap!
I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL!  This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone to far this time!!
Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks. Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys! Ahahahahahahaa ha! 
Hey!  Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!
Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. 
You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?! Butters, do you really wanna just go back to school, where people just make fun of you?
Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.
Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true! 
It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...
Do not open your eyes until morning.  Or else I will kick you in the nuts.  Square in the nuts.
Two donuts and a pack of licorice.  Well, Tony, the usual?  Why are you crying, Chad?
Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.
"Ooh, I don't wanna dig up my dead grandma 'cause I'm such a goody-two-shoes!"  Ow.
Hey guys, have you been takin' your Ritalin?
No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!
Beth found out they have a room at the Airport Hilton. We need to search it. Here's the hotel!  Beth, tell Leeroy to pull up here!  All right, let's go! Move out! 
We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.

Maybe this'll teach you to listen to authoritah. 
You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!
You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! 
It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! 
Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it!  Well Butters?!
Just send a maintenance guy to my room. I want this Nintendo hooked up to my float screen NOW! 
Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.
Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you.
Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick.  Wendy, you're not gonna believe this.  I just found out my mom has breast cancer.  Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs.
It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it. 
You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?
Can't read my, can't read my,

It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.
Damnit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!
Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives.  Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow!
Then maybe I can make myself believe it too.  Thanks you guys. I'm gonna go chase a dream. 
Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle!
What the hell?  Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only!
Oh-my-god!  You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.
Me??  There's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle. 
Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three feti; I've gotta sell the rest before they spoil.
Oh, how's Kenny gonna get one?! He's hella poor!
There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead.
No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long. 
All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next! 
Dude, Filipino hookers don't get fucked the way I do!
...and here's some old toys that I don't need anymore.  And here! Here's some Christmas cookies!  And some holly and mistletoe!  Oh, this'll the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too.
I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car. 
But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?
Oh did they? Uh I hadn't heard about that.
All right, when she stops yappin' again, say "Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right."
President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?
Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in Santa's sleigh!
Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on.  Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow!
I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band,  Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.
I don't like thinking about what I wanna be when I grow up, alright?! 
All this time! Why didn't you tell me, father?!
You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!
Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?
Wir egal un die Comedy Awarding Thing. Es war Kinder der special education. Sie macht uns wÃ¤hlen. 
I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!
All right, Butters, you leave me no choice. 
Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp.
You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!
Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix! 
You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes.
Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. 
Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! 
Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me.
Yeah, dude! My mom says all I have to do is chow on this box.
Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack.  All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: "I mis-interpreted the rules." It's what you must also say when caught cheating! "I mis-interpreted the rules." Say it with me.
It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. '
Hey, how come you don't have sores on your lips, Ma?
No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that!
God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream!
They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead. 
Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes.  One.  Heh, two.  Come on! Uugh, come on, now! Come on, uuhhhgghh  yeahhh. Hoh. Phew.  Hoh. ...Oh, God-damnit! 
Will you stop with the whole "mom smoking crack" thing?! It's a old joke!
No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.
And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television.
Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?!
Why don't we just talk about the swastika?
Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those?
I'm better-looking than you!  The girls think I'm better-looking than you, Kyle!
Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.
Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers? 
That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid.  Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too.  I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?
Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
Look out, Artemus Clyde Frog! It's a giant metal spider!  Bang! Bangbang!  Yoyoyo, jiggity jiggy with it! Bang bang bang!  We saved the day! The Wild Wild West, The Wild Wild Wild West. Uhyo wicky wicky scratch, Uh wicky wicky scratch... 
That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
It's not fair! It's not fair; I wanna die! I wanna daaahahie! 
Yeah sooo I'm thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of running water, yeah kind of Zen it out.
Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?
What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee.
Me?  I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men.
Come on, Jack, you gotta be able to offer me more than that. ...Yes, I realize there's a ban on stem-cell research, but I've got thirty-some-odd human fetuses in my backyard! I'm sure there's other research your company can do with them. ...You'll take one? Okay, how much for one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my balls here, Jack.
Yes, hello, is this Captain Bly's Seafood Restaurant? ...Yeah, hi, I've got a shipment of about thrity-one of the most succulent shrimp from the West Indies. ...These are killer shrimp, Gary, your customers are gonna love 'em. ...What kind of price you payin' for shrimp? ...Oh, Gary, you're breakin' my balls, Gary. How about ten and a quarter? ...Balls, Gary. Breakin' 'em. ...Alright, I'll call you back. 
Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew.  No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew.
Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money.
Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!
Ey! Seriously, dude! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!  Mother f- 
Well, I wanna know who my dad is, but... to find out they have to do these DNA tests, and they cost $3000 and... I don't have $3000.
Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso. 
Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?!
Me? You're the one talking about killer titties.  Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people.  Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!
Yes, with every passing second I become more powerful.
Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow...  Yesss... Yeesss...
Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny! 
Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting.
...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!
Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?
Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video. 
Well, I'm a badass cowboy living in a cowboy's
Age, wicky wicky scratch yo yo bang bang
Me and Artemus Clyde Frog go save
Salma Hayek from the big metal spider
Wicky wicky wick, wicky wicky wick, Fresh
Cowboy from the Westside.Wicky wicky scratch yo yo bang bang
Me and Artemus Clyde Frog go save
Salma Frog Polly Prissy Pants go down to...
Well... mm-Rumpertumskin.
We got him! I know where he is!
Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. 
I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles-
Well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? 'Cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been FUCKED! 
Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale.
Look at how the crap ...is sittin' right in the middle! 
Oh, well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate pie, but uuuuh-I left it at home 
All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble?
You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you! 
Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.
Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this.Â Â We could just play with this. Screw video games, dude! Who fuckin' needs them?!
Who cares? Kenny's dead!  When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?
Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?!
Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris tomorrow?
Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar!  So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah,  and putting a dollar in the box-ah!  Come on, don't be shy! Come on now! 
It's okay! I'm a hallway monitor!  Keep separation! Leeroy, check out our twenty!
Bolo ties are...  really in right now. Cool you have one.
I don't know, but you're the only one who can.
The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play?
Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars?
I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom.
What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!
Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde.
Well, I dreamt that I was a poor Vietnamese girl, and then you guys made me ride a big, scary bull, and then Leonardo DiCaprio gave me a spankin' for several hours.  Eeyy, where did you guys win all those Terrance and Phillip dolls?
I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut!
Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might by a...  Pakistani.
Can't go on... need... appetizer... eh...  I'm sorry, God, I'm sorry I mocked poor people. I'm sorry I wasn't more sensitive. Please, Please God, uhh.  Heh, my god has forsaken me. Eh, err.  Huh, I wonder what's in here?  SNACKY CAKES!! MMMM!  Sally Struthers?!
Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley.
...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull.
ItÂ isÂ real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole!
Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson.
Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people.  Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm.  Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh.  Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!
Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most.
Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!
Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.
Shut up, Scott Malkinson. "I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes."
Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!
Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.  You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said.
What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled! 
Kyle, we need to try to find a-
Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.
Nah. Come on, guys. Let's go look for crocodi-iles.
LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!
Come on, Kyle. Let these Sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control functionality.Â 
Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer. 
But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right? 
Come on, you guys, it's getting cold up here!
Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see.  no  No.  NO!  God-damnit 
Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me.
Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me.
Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-
We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa! 
Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. 
Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Oohh. Eow.
You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down!
Big Ring Slammer. Comes with posable neck-smash grip.  That's pretty kewl. Let's see...
Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house. 
Haahaahahaha!  Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!
Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?
Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh-  I'm gonyanya, uhnyuh, uhnyuuh, nyaahh 
Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us!  Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe! 
All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle.
This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future. 
I got some badass guys to help me.
I only had to pay them fifteen bucks.
You think you got away with not having a hall pass?
You won't get away from me 'cause I'm the Dawg!
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
Think you can get away with not having a hall pass? Think again!  How was that, Butters?
Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.
I said I will only talk to the President!
Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!
Look what the tooth fairy left me last night! 
No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time!
Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese. 
No, no. Polacks aren't that funny dude. Try somethin' else. 
Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys.
Ey! Help me, you son of a bitch!  Huh, I'm gonna die up here.
That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can really see them flourish. Tweek!
Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.
Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.
There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse.
No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!
This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.
I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall-Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall-Mart all along!
...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop. 
Jews.. ...play stupid games
Jews... that's why they're lame.
I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys! 
All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain!
This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now.  Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. 
I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, "Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!" and I smack him on the head!
Uh, Kyle?  Come on, seriously?  You are really reaching right now.
Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go!  MOM, GET UP!
Look.  I put the stem cells from all the fetuses I had next to a Shakey's, and they ARE replicating a new Shakey's!  It worked! 
That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that.
I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt.  A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls!  I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!
Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now.
My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.
Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts.
Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice! 
What the hell is wrong with you people?!
Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.
Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?
Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!
Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name? 
Hold the sign up, Kyle!  Higher, Kyle!  Okay.  Here we go. 
Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you.
Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.
Now, let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time, Frenchy.
Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush.
What? What was that? Butters? Token?!  Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh!  You guys?! GUYS!
No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! 
Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you.  And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!
The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up. 
I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body.
Token, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time  I'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock! 
Well then I inadvertently won the game, didn't I?
I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!
Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball!
Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name! 
Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.
If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream? 
You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say!  I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! 
My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy.
Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.
We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!
Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything.
God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch!
Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.
Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?
Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again.
Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!
Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans.
Oh look out, Holly Hobby's all pissed off! 
Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch.  Okay. 
Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!
Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns!
Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening?
I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!
That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!
No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad.  So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye. 
Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class,  you will see that the announcements are now being done in video.
Jakov, please don't go.  You make everything in South Park fun.  You brought life to this whole town. It would suck without you.
Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.
You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it! 
Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS.
My name isn't Eric Cartman, it's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it?
...When I get all my superpowers, I'm gonna use them to smote you two assholes right off the planet!  Dude, superpowers are sweet.
Me, too.  I'm choosing my own toys from now on, 'cause-- 
Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris!
Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey.
You've already been here awhile, Kenny, so you have to introduce me to your friends, okay? And make sure they know I'm kewl. You've gotta have my back, Kenny! 
Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams. 
You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
There she is! Get her!  Die, you stupid bitch!
Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.
Attention! All right, you booty lovers! So you decided to join Captain Cartman's edjeh...  Uh, guys, who let in the g-i-n-g-e-r?
Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!
P'h. Nice costume, you guys. You spent about a buck fifty on those?
Just make the boat go that way, kind of.  That's good. Now bring her around portside.  Now that's a pirate ship!  A fine day o' plunderin' we had, boys! What about yourselves?  Here you are, lads. Plenty of booty to go around.  A round of grog for me boys!  A round of grog for everyone!  The fuck is this? This is water in a Dixie cup! Alright, Goddammit, really you guys! What kind of pirates are you?! Look at yourselves! You disgrace the Blackbeard! I don't know where you people get off calling yourselves pirates!  Little beat-up boats, water in Dixie cups. I mean, I mean look, look at this guy!  Look at this guy for Christ's sake!  I mean, how hard is this, people?!   I tell you lads, if we're gonna be the most feared people on Earth, then there needs to be some Goddamned changes around here!
Weee drink and we pillage and we do what we please! We get all that we want for free!
...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer.
See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally!Â 
Here we go, this has gotta be it right here. 
Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat!
Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.
Oh? I've got a better idea. Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?
Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody!  Where the hell is Timmy?
And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!
It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?
You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out. 
Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!
You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!
But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! 
Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.
But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.
Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass...
Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision.  Butterscotch candy?
That's it! Party is over!  Everybody go home!  GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! THE PARTY'S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT! 
Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this!
But I wanna sing the Cheesy Poofs song on the commercial!
Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up? 
Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass. 
Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!
We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here! 
That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did!  Dude, it's Puff Daddy!
Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one? 
Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!
I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller?  Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.
No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here.
Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton? 
Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?
Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again.
It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!
Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about video games, but now I'm branching out into talking about people talking about music and the arts as well.
Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid!
You know what this is? This is the mace that they use on bears, faggot! Now let me see your hall pass!
Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with?
Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?
He crapped his pants today during social studies! He had to go to the nurse's office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans! 
Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.
He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls. 
Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks?
Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars!  Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route.
We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita!  Aw man, this is gonna be so great!
I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.
It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke.  I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. 
That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts!
Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash.
All right, this one I can win!  Here, hold this!  I'll show you Goddamned retards! 
HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads!
Yeess.  Yeess.  It worked, you guys, it actually worked!
What the? ...Oh, Token's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable.
And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?
He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at!  Bah!
I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right?  The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle. You are a race of beady-eyed thieves who are always wan- 
There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?
Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off.
A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this "poutaine".
Ha! You just got f'd in the a!
Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye.  How's it goin', man?
No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto.
Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge
No, come back! You face everlasting damnation!  Wait! No! No!  I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!
Dude. You know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump? Awesome! 
So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama.
Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too! 
Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness.  I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest.  We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary. 
I know, right. Women are just jealous 'cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap.
This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public. We can say we gave our "student athletes" a place to live and grow for a few years. It's like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! Great work! 
Well here.  Roy keeps the keys in the glove box.
You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember. 
This asshole needs to make a move already!
Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve!  Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others. 
I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter!
It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!
Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea.
Oh, come on, Kenny! You never have a sweet costume! You're not gonna win the costume contest!
How do I reach these keeds?  All right, let's go get you an abortion.
"I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes."
No way! Those sons of bitches! I'm going home.
Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore.  Oh yes it is! 
No way, dude! What would I wipe with?
Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom?  
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.
She's a mean ole bitch 'cause she has stupid hair, 
she a bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch 
she's a stupid bitch!
Kyle's mom's a bitch and she's just a dirty bitch!
KYLE'S MOOOM IS A - BI-I-I-ITCH - aahh.
Zzzzt zzzzsssht!  Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out.
Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?
My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.
We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.
I knew it! Meecrob!  Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do!
Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!
Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life.
Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard! 
Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.
You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies Butters. You have to hurry!
Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?
She wasn't looking at you, buttlord, she was looking at me!
Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass!Â 
Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again!
What? What the hell are you guys doing??
Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.
Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump.
God, I'm glad you guys know all these "pooping outside" rules!  Urgh. Come on, now.
Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle.
Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.
You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than "shit", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob. 
Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff!
What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.
Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of "shit". We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob. 
Dude!  You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. 
Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle.  Let's see what I can muster up here.
Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in.
Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's eveyone, I guess.  All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.
Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?
Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here.
Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.
Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.
Be very very quiet. I'm hunting crocodiles, hahahahahaha.
No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay! 
But I'll have to sing the Cheesy Poofs song for that talent va-a-an!
Scanning for Mexicans.  Oh!  We've got a Mexican! 
Dude, at least flush the toilet!  Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts.
Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now.
Hello, sir, my name is Kris
Kristofferson. I'm with the IRS. I'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes.
Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! 
What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step?  So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tahink â¦ tahink â¦ tahink.
You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch.
The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. 
Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.
Look, we spent all night at the recording studio. Now it's time to sleep!
Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated.
Not too expensive for Token's rich ass family, apparently. 
Token, Token, got a question for you:  Token, do you like fishsticks?
Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! 
Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.
You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle? 
We got her back safe. We lost a lot of good men in the process.
Make it go away! I hate Barbra Streisand! I hate her! 
Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack.
Yes.  A chocolate friend.  Mr. Candy Bar doesn't judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy Bar likes you just the way you are.  Look at how yummy and sweet he is.  ...There you go. That'll just be four dollars.  ...There you go.
Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?
Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can.
Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You're reached the big time. 
Yes. These people, Jakov, these people need you. I need you. Please, Jakov. Stay?
Oh my God, you guys. Look!  They do have an amazing fountain. 
I am going to fucking kill you guys, seriously. 
If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.
But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!
Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all up like little beavers, right, and then put 'em in a pond, and see if they build a dam! 
I am Captain Cartman and this here be my terrible crew! We be lookin' for a ship to pirate with
Mexicans are told not to cheat. "Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child." So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.
We take to the African sea!
We'll brave the squalls and bust your balls
Somalian pirates we!
Haha. Oh man, that was great. Okay, go ahead. I'm all out of farts now.  Gahaaa! Derrr!
Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine.
O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll
Kyle's mom is a bitch, 
she's a big fat bitch, 
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world
She a stupid bitch, 
if there ever was a bitch, 
she's a bitch to all the boys and girls.
What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck.
No, Kitty, it's mah pot pie!  Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!
Well, I guess now that that's out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy!  That's it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red rocket, dog. Red rocket now.
Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!
More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting onÂ Call Of Duty, so let's start.
Are you telling me that I drove nine hours through butt-fucking nowhere to get a god-damned shirt?! Mom, Grandma's gone senile! It's time to stick her in a home!
That's it! Now I'm all pissed off!  Take that, hippie! 
I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself! 
What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  That's two to nothing, amigoo. 
It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her armyÂ , but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation.Â Â It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be...Â Â grounded?
Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch!
Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.
Nobody screws up my trick-or-treats and gets away with it!  Aaah, kew!
Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!
Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?!
This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian!
Alright, come in.Â Â Kenny's here; I told him all about it.Â 
We set course tomorrow! I purchased everyone's ticket online using me mother's credit card!
My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.
Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bedâ¦  in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room . Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open  and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway.  Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me.  And they had big heads and big black eyesâ¦
The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!
No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Token was able to do all that is because his family is rich!
Now, personally, I like the baby green.  But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house.
Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR.
Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.
I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...
Great, just sign right here, please.  Hi. Havin' an abortion today?  Great.  Listen, if you'd like to sell your abortion for research I'm offering uh, seventy-five dollars. Help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there.  And you sign right here.  Uh excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus? 
Oh, I'm sorry, but I thought we were at war with these assholes!
Dude! You need to put a tighter leash on your dog!
Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars! 
Hang on. I'm going to do something killer.  God damnit, stop it, Kyle!
I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.
Okay, okay, let's try to watch the language; there's children present heuh.
Oh my dick's gettin hard again! It's protrudin' out myÂ paaaaants!
Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna put it on the Internet or... No, wait! Kenny.  I just had the greatest idea... ever!
I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner-chicks like vacuum cleaners 
Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!
I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go.
Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess.
Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend. 
This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!
Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true.  I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera . I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children.
Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?!  Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired.
Never! I'll get that triangle if it's the last thing I do!
You son of a bitch!  Wait a minute.  Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device. 
All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout.  Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions?
Hey, there's a lot of big words in these books.
I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard!
Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.
Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--
That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance & Phillip last night!
My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!
People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.
...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like...  Like uh...  Liiike...
Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around.
I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why , we're gonna transform into something.
Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?
Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go?
I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!
Go to MySpace.  See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.
Wait for it, wait for the whore line.
Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.
I would if I could, you son of a bitch!
Not now, Mom! We're playing Texans versus Mexicans! Gah!  All right patrol, you all know the drill. Not one Mexican is to get past this border! Not a single one! Yeehaw!
Hm. I don't really see the irony in that, Kyle. 
It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.
Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home! 
That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways. 
Well, let's go home, start eating that candy.
Nobody told us if we win too many games we'd go on to the finals!
I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me!
How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet.
Ey, sweet!  Sweeeeeet! Check it out, guys; you don't even have to put a quarter in her.
Naive American, Stan, and the bear is very important to my people. 
Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is the NSA's worst nightmare!
Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.
Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids.  Eh, oh yeah?! We- well you guys are assholes!  Grow up! 
No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us.
Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!
You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked!
Have no fear, for God is near
And God loves all his children
Huh?  Nooooooo!  Kyle, why? What are you doing?
Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!
I HATE YOU! I WANT YOU TO DIE! DIE!!
Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are?
Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important.
You'd better get us out of here, asshole!
Mom, I am serious! This has gone on long enough! Get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken!  That's how you want it, bitch?! Fine!  I hate you! I'm running away!
But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?
But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.
Oh goddamnit, nobody's doing anything kewl!Â Â I'm so bored! Everything is so stupid!
Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week.
I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.
No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!
But  Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man.
All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.
Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe! 
Okay, listen up, Mexicans. We need you to read  "The Old Man and the Sea" for us. Comprende? "The Old Mand Y La Mer".
I can't. I have to go home and get in shape.
Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.
We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?
Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan...
Hey, I didn't get a gun.  Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam
Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?
Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go!
I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.
Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome.
Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got!
Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.
Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms.
GOD I HATE CRAIG!!  That son of a... djah!! 
Oh I can't wait! This is gonna be so awesome!  Get out of my way!
You what? Stay at home? All day? No school?
Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.  "Super... Phun Thyme."  Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!
Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television!
Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it.
Heh, we apparently don't say 'side dishes' at the table, either.
Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.
Don't worry, nobody can see us wearing black.
Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken.
If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are...  Mitch Conner.
No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys.
What's that supposed to mean? Kyle?  Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!
Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls! 
...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!!  Ready, pony?  Bite it!  Yes!! 
I got a call-back for the Cheesy Poofs song!
And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. 
Do you know what this is?!  This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts. 
That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?
Yes! Yes! I'm a star! I'm a star! I'm--  Aaawww, I'm nobody! God-damnit!  Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign from God. That's it, isn't it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million dollars, don't you? That's it! 
The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!
It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!
Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?
All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we're go to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle.
He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on "Nurse Jackie" and on "Rockin' The Boat."
...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here.
Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in it's vagina! 
There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow. 
Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout.
You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks.
Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob.
I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.
Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip.
For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person!  This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!
Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do!
Guys! Guys?  Can anybody hear me? You guys??  Token, Token, I'm here!  Hello! Hello! Hello!  Clyde, can't you feel me?  Feel me, Clyde!  Jimmy! Jimmy, it's me, Eric!  Jimmy!  Can't you feel your hair move?! That's me!  They don't even know yet, that one of their best friends is dead.  Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul.
Oh yeah?! I'll bet you five bucks that when you die you crap your pants, asshole!
Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?
I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera. 
You might as well go buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked! Do you wanna fuck me Mom?!  Just say so! Go ahead! Here!  Huh?! Go ahead, Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me right here in the Best Buy! You wanna fuck your son so bad?! Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me!
Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now.
I only know how to do it doggie style.
I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction. 
Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought!
Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!
No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!
How can I trust you?  How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself.  Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.
No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!
I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later.
That's Kyle the Jew again, talking aboutÂ Call Of DutyÂ to Stan.
Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.
Oh, please. Bradying is to 2000 and lame.
What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?
Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium! 
Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.
Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!
Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team.
Yeah, well, Dad's being a little pussy, Mom.
It's okay, Red. I can take a shit here. I'm a dumb chick too. 
Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mon's cake, pie, and ice cream, then.
It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!
Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?
Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function.
Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle.
Oh my God. I crapped my pants.  You guys, I crapped my pants!  Heheh. You guys! You guys, check it out!
Sure you do. You're a great mom.Who's got the greatest mom in the world?I dooo.My mom is number one in my heart.It's true!
We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.  There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone!  Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!
No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!
Oh, I'm not gloating. I just got a little call from a record company in Los Angeles and, they want Ms. Lopez to recored an album next week.
Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god.
Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species.  Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine.
Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award.
Mom! You got the new Duffy's catalog! I-I'm gonna circle everything I want for Christmas, okay? Mom? Okay? O-kay , let's see.  I waant... thiis... aand... this...  and...  let's see, comes with so...  ...comes with two bars , so there we go, have that...  and, let's see...
Well, well well! You guys can now kiss my ass, because I was on television!  Ey! Didn't you guys see it?! I was on television!  You missed it! You missed it because of this stupid planetarium!  Planetariums suck ass! 
Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.
Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!
I can't go with you guys right now.
I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.
CartmaaanBrah! CartmanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel, brahs.
You think I'm fat and unimportant now?!Â Â I AM Eric Cartman! And I've got news for you! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, and on Alec Baldwin's new television show, via Shitter!
Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!
...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you Lord.
You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to have a see.
What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!
Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!
Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!
Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am.  See that? Hippies. 
That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people! 
Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?!  Hey, Kyle.  Uhh. Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh.  We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up.
Science-damnit!  Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records?
Yes. It's all finally come to fruition.  The final cog in my... master plan.  This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air.  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.
They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!
Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare?
Hey you guys!  You know what time of year it is?
I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!
No! My wife, Token! Token, that's my wife!
Well, because, unlike you guys, I just got my first pubes! Ayada da daa, yadadadadee! 
I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!
You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.
No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.
Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle. 
Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.
Your haiku insults have no effect on me, Kyle. I'm regional champion.
Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey.  Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr.
Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole!
See? You're scared. Because you know if you say it a third time, he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face. 
I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat.
Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on. 
Hey you guys, this works pretty good right now.
I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!
I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a Wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while. 
Ugh yeah?! Well you all need to stay focused, Goddamnit!  If you let yourselves get distracted for even one minute, we're gonna be overrun with these jobless, no good-!
Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere.
Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!
Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.
Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better.
Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine. 
Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.
The Special Olympics? What's so special about them?
Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?
Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.
Oh wow, where are we now, brahs?Â Â This looks pretty stupid.
What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?
No, but you've gotta cry, like this:  "My parents molestered me."  And then they'll say something like, "Was it a good touch or a bad touch?" and you say  "Uh, it was a good touch" or- no wait,  you say it was a bad touch.
Please show your support for CartmanBrah brah right now by uh...
And you feel like you have to confess.
Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking topical and revamping old Catholic jokes!
Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing.
I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week.
Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks!
All right, get down. This is my kind of bullride.
And now, for a look at the weather, here is Token Black, and Token, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way.
You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.
Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.
Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now.
Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal. 
I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do!
Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg.
I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole.
Oh, I'm sorry! Next time I'll just ask my fart nicely if it wouldn't mind staying tucked away for a while!
Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with.
Who's "we"? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry!
All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff.
No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.
Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming "NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!" You know this to be true.  Go ahead. Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle.  Do it. 
Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?
Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!
So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Token's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!
Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?
It was not a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000! And if--  There he is!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic.
Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers.  What?
Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.
Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work.
Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!
Dude, Wendy plays volleyball. Did you know that? I don't think you knew that.
So does that mean I'll never laugh again?
There, see?! How do you like them apples!  HA!
My heart says ye-es (ye-es ye-es) but my vajayjay says no-o
Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Token and Nichole are gonna be practically married.
I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation! I don't need to hear crap from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial! Screw you guys! I'm going home.
I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. 
You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts!How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!
A man just broke into my house and is-  Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?!
I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato!
Well, good job Einstein, why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime?  Hey!
What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about "McNuggets"?
Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?
Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing!  How do I reach these keeds?
Well well well well well well well well well Kyle! You came all this way to try and join my pirate club.
No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!
Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?
NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.
Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me!  I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!
All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?!  Oh, hold on.  Aah, let's see... that one.  Stupid fraud!  Good riddance to YOU! 
Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. 
North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath.
And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!
Is this cool or not? I can't tell.
It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that last for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen. 
Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to "Phantom Of The Opera"?!  Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice.  Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!
You can't be the tough one, you're Jewish!
Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!
Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.
I told you guys! "Washington Redskins" totally gets people's attention!
And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!
Hey! He slept with my girlfriend, referee! In my country we don't wait for a bell, miste- ah!
You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.
Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye.  Brown eye! 
Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be.
No, dude, independent films are those black and white hippie movies. They're always about gay cowboys eating pudding.
You guys, it's six in the morning, I have to get some sleep.
My stupid friends want to go to the mall to visit Mr. Hankey, but nobody would drive us.
Look!  Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff.
Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss you are, Craig.
Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you. 
Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton.
Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards.  Wewewewewewe...
Let's just see where Token's clothes come from, shall we?  Ooooo, Armani Exchange!
We be headin' to Somaaliaa. By way of Miami to Cairo. And take care o' you put us in an exit row, you land lubber!
You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of network are you running there in Canada?! Don't call me buddy! I'm not your buddy! 
You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it. 
Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this!
I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video?
So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it!  Our first album cover. 
Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go.
My heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that door.
I promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights.
Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle?
No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning.
I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video.  What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra.  And you're the first to see it.  This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this.  'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for...  right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again.  Wait for it... wait... there!  Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us.
Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh.
Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please?
Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?!
Put the lotion in the fucking basket!  Oh no! Precious!  I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it!  Now you say, "Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!"
Shit! Butthole!  Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry.  Titties! Cock!  Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface!
Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass.
Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.
Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar!
Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long!
Alright, let's hear it for Kyle!  He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! That's super funny, guys!  Laugh it up, everyone!  Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel!
If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!
They mostly come at night, mostly.  Ey, I was watching Aliens on TV!
Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours!
Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job?
Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before.
I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.
What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!
I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.
Oh really. Ten thousand subscribers and counting, brah!
God! She didn't take this long to die.
I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass.
Okay, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to-
Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him.Â Â How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons inÂ Game of Thrones?
Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle... Happy Passover!
Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Token?  Who, who else needs a partner?  Uh who else needs a partner?
I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real.
What? NO!  NOO!!  You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over!
Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!
All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice. 
It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now.  Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?
Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.
Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game.
I'm not pouting! I just heard all these jokes before!
We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us?
Stan? Has anybody actually seen the nurse, and come back to tell about it?
Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, "Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!" 
KISS MY ASS!!!  Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak.
Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!
Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month.
Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me "fatass," "butthole," and "douchebag." I really don't feel like you guys's friend. 
Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.
You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay.
The rest of you will just have to try another day.
And so the party returns home after completing their great quest.
Well, I did a lot of thinking. And you know, guys, there's an important lesson I think we've all learned. What do we do when the tables are turned?
The day's looking brighter. Gray skies are turning blue.
'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not) the poor kid at school!
Kenny's back and it's such a thrill. Now I'm rich just like Stan and Kiul!
All that matters is no one thinks I'm a tool! 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not)
That's right, the poor kid in school.
Sing it with me, guys!
He's not the poor kid in school. (He's not)
I'm not-
There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!
Talangar the Black returns from watching the video. 
Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here.
Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money.  Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!
Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?
Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.
But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say.
Hello??  Whoever you are, just give them back! Haven't you done enough to me?! 
It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now!
What? But uh, why should I sue the school?
Shhh.  Be right with you.  We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed.
Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!
Ah, Mr. Garrison, I don't think that's quite fair, uh I mean, you rarely let us get up and leave during the class.
Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.
Stan, don't be such a dumbass. You have to trust people. 
Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome.
I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!
Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave.  Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye...  Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right!
Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!
Bliegh!  Yugh. Uh, okay, try again. Hep .
Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy.
Mm-mo-om, Ah-ee nÃ©e-eed suh-ome Weight Gain Four Thousaaand! I need iiit!
She'll be the death of him, Kyle. Mark my words: she'll be the death of him.
Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?
I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade!
Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!
Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now.
Yeah, see, the problem is, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kids in skewl!
It's a picture ...of me.  And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.
No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!
Wow, a dragon right on the blade. Mom, can I get a Sumatomi sword used by the ancient Tokugawa soldiers??
Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd better&lt;/&gt; do it better than that.  Next!
Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier. 
I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment!
We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!
Mister!  No! Stop, Token, stop! My brains! Stop eating my brains! Brad Pitt!  Hey Token. What's up, bro?  Fist bump? 
God, when is this gonna get to the commercials? 
I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.
Oh man, this is so great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you! 
Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?!  Oh crap! 
Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!
Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?!
Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle?  Asscheeks!  Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition.
Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!
...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!
Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us.
Oh man, I thought that day would never end.
Oh, thank you, Jesus.  So we're friends now?
...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call...
Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything.
You guys...  Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this.
Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches.
All right Butters, will you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.
It's all right! There's been a misunderstanding! I'm a hall monitor.  This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway infraction by skipping off to Milan.
I'm sorry. Did you say something, Skyler?  Agh!
Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles...  Double-Stuff Oreos...  He ... He's taking the top of one and...  ...and he puts it together to make Quadruple-Stuffs!  I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs!
Oh, good. In The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, a bunch of uh, hippies, walk around and paint stuff. They eat lunch, and then they find a magical... camel... which they have to eat to stay alive. And that's pretty much it; I give it a B-minus.
Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you!
...And so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television.
Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like Animaniacs?
If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained?

Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums!

Lots of rich people
giving change to the homeless
I ate my underwear!  What the hell do you want from me?!  Weh-
I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?
I can't wait two months!  I can't! There has to be a way around this!
What do you mean, what am I doing?! Im just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys.
How long is that Chessy Poofs van gonna be outside?
Kyle, you're bein' an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah.  Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch! 
Hell, yeah I do, I got the triangle.I got the triangle, I got the triangle, dee dun dee dun
Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers.
Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame.
Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?
He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it!  Ow. 
Whoa, what uh, are you serious?  Oh my God, that's KFC gravy!  You have KFC! Yes!  This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?!
I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.
Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me.
Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like "Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!" 
Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make.
Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here.Â 
How the hell did Mr. Hankey get so popular? Look at all this Mr. Hankey stuff. 
We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.
You guys can't scare me! I know you're making it all up.
Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?
Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!
That's only 72 shopping days left for you!
There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!
Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back?
Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger.
Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.
Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive.
So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us.  Hooray.  Oh oh. Hold still, Kenny. 
It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! 
Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!
Dude, I think it's totally working. The girls are totally buying it. 
The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!
Eh-ih... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me.
Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streible probably had it comin' to her.
Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven.
This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter.
Now, just yell "Put the lotion in the fucking basket!"
Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful!
The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned!
The Body of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could call it my own!
You're one time, two times, three times my Savior...
Whenever I see Jesus up on that Cross I can't help but think that he looks kinda hot...
The Federation has agreed to fight with us!Â Â With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size!Â Â You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle?
Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... 
And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you, and some peanuts. 
Could you um... go on the Maury Povich show with me and say that I'm out of control and do drugs and have sex so that I can go to the largest putt-putt gold course in the wwoooorrlldd?
You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in!  Please.
Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war!
You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday.
Yup! You know what Hillary says: "You can suck my clit and balls." 
Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!
Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.  Ah, now, where were we?
Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know!
Uhh trust me, he's not fat and unimportant. I think we need to change his status to "ripped and sweet."Â Â 'Scuse me. Excuse me! There's a very important threat to national security! We need to change Eric Cartman's status!
Excused? Oh, oh but we are in the middle of class. 
All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages.
The Black Jackal. Karate Kick Panel Force and bendable neck-
They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go-  Thank you Butters. All right, we need to go over there and find out what we can from those Commie rats.  Oh, herro, prease, herro.
You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina.
"Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling federation and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth."
Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  Look, see that traffic signal down there?  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free.
Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?
I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet.
Why?!  Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why?!  Why?! 
No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.
Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for...
Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the run-down school. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I should've done a long time ago.  Nobody notices what I have in my front pocket. A little surprise for them all.  I'm prepared for this, but still I wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will! 
Yeah uh huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy but I'm really a girl.
Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Token, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.
Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!
You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest "fuck you" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo. 
Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!
I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behnd my back!
Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of.  Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token.  Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln?  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.
You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.
I did. I'm the Rad Russian.  I come from Russian to crush your puny capitalist heads!
This is bullcrap!  I can't reach the freezer!
Yeah, because the government won't respect my privacy.
Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!
Du-dude! You're doing it all wrong! Let me handle this.  Alright ya scalliwags! Surrender your plunder and let me send my shot across your bow!
Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet!
Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember!  I shoved it up my ass!  Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap!  Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde...
What the hell is "Hooked On Monkey Fonics?"
Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?
Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye.
You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!
You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!
Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?
I know I know, check it out, look.  I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!
She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...
Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys.
Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on. 
Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help.Â Â But I hope that we're clear that this is my army.Â Â There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules.
Aha! Kenny! I should have known!  Why do you have a picture of Mysterion in your locker, Kenny?!  Unless you are Mysterion!
Last time, when Butters spent the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.
What the hell?! This game's all boring now!
I thought I was safe here! Stay there guys, I'll be right back! 
Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play!
Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was.
Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.
What the hell is wrong with you?! Stop it, Kitty!
Just go, Butters. We're running out of time.
Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.
Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final lie
Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny.
I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!
Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on.  Check it out. I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right? 
Uh oh.  Sounds like you're still angry, Token.
Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!
Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!
Ey, what the hell are you talking about?!  I'm not a god-damned Canadian, and neither are you!
Hur-ry, get into wardrobe!  Oh hur-ry up, will you hur-ry?!  Oh, you look marvelous, dahling.
Dude!!  How did he get past the fence, Craig?!
I will! James West, cowboy and rap star!  Quick, Artemus Clyde Frog! We've got to save Salma Hayek!
Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning.
We want you to give our parents herpes.
God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!
Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.
So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like "Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!" And Clyde is all like "Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!" Dude, it was a riot.
I can't believe I got a stupid shirt!  The holidays are bullcrap!
I'm ready!  Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool. 
Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth?
And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly...
Huh, I can't. I'm too tired.  Maybe tomorrow.
Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better!
Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude. 
Oh, pretty good, except I had the weirdest dream last night.
Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?
Looks like you're about to get pwned.  Heeyeah! 
Nobody followed you, right? You didn't tell anybody?!
No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!
It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. 
Black people say He-ey!  Cool. White people say Ho ho! 
Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!
The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!
Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants. 
I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to water!
Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed. 
We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.
I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats.
Oh come on, you guys. We still have plenty of money left over.
What happens if we win the State Championship game?
Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.
I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers and you don't.
Ahhh, this is the best day of my life. 
Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more. 
Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?
Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?
Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday.
I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face!
Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends.  And he's had a profile for more than six months.
Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins.
Why?  Is your sister gonna kick your ass again?
Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend. 
I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost!
Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!
They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again.
Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?
We know a way inside the Red Robin.Â Â You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how.
Because I don't want a chick watching me go poo!
It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!
You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!
Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!
Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter.
Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!
Yeah.  We'll see you later, Kyle.  Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents.
Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can outthink them.
I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.
I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy.
You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off.
This sucks. I don't wanna keep havin' to come up with ideas for shows all the time. It hurts my head. 
Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.  I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second. 
Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us! 
Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!
That's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want! 
Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water!
Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!
I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg.
Be a man Stan.  Just say, "Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies."
It's all CartmanBrah now. Â I am trending into something more than human. I am becoming... transgender. Â Now they will HAVE to give my my own bathroom!
We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys!  Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down.
Well, Butters, there is no I in "team."
Oh yeah, that one's cool.  Yeah, this part's killer. 
We are going to start... a Christian rock band.
Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk.
Well, I guess we'll have to roshambo for it.
Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now!  Now you guys get down there-  Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go!  Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well.  Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too.  Hey Kyle. Have a seat.
'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.
Ah yes, herro prease.  We are Chinese peopull.
Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I?  Â¡Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar!
Hey! I bet Kenny has some food stamps on him!
I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be!
All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  Jesus Christ!  One please.
No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.
Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.
Yeah, when you die, your jowels release and crap comes flying out your ass. 
He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget.
Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out.
Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! Goddammit! 
You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy.
I'm telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we don't have any privacy anymore!Â Â Just between you and me, I think everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. Did you guys read "1984"?
Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened.  Kenny has a girlfriend.
Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?
No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.
Okay, okay, okay you guys! You know what? You know what?  That's what.  Suck my clit and balls.
This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!
Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer.
There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf.
Stupid asshole!Â Â Yes, hello. I'd like to speak to the president of XBox, please... The president of XBox, like, the head of XBox... Fine, CEO of Microsoft, whatever. Put him on. I need help blowing up PlayStation people... Eric Cartman. I'm a wizard and a king... A wizard-king, yes... No, I'm not king of wizards, I'm a king that happens to be a wizard.Â Â Just put the CEO of Microsoft on the phone!
Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine! 
Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next?  Whip it out, Butters. 
Come on in, Bob.  All right, just let me use my tools... 
Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely.
There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up! 
That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.
Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!
Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school.
But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank?  Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie.
Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now. 
Let's see... Matthew 15:11. "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man." That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting. 
God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!
Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought "Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!"
You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying!
Yes, very nice. Apparently, these are the pirates.
Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and s-and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep!
Every night, the dream is the same.  I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls.  And it turns out I was right. "Time to pay up, Kyle."  But then...  "NO! NOOO!"  It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust. 
Boy you like my body. Set the mood, let's play!
You can touch me anywhere except for my vajayjay.
I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs. 
But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right?
You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.
You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!
You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!
Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother.
Where's your pass?! Show me your hall pass, brah!
Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.
Hey!  What the hell are you doing?  Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!
Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous.
You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous.
Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?
And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny.
Yes. He's been following us for like two hours. 
Tell her, tell her that I love her.
I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her.
Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this!
No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse.
Will you all shut up so I can do this!?
What did I do to deserve this?!  How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!
Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several.
Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls.
Ey, get off of him, you fuckin' nutsack!
My moms barely bought me any presents so far.
Come on, kitties. Outside. Come on.  That's it. Come on, come on.  Uh oh.
Dude, I really can't hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something?
I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.
Hmm.  I can't.  I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. 
It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.
Well I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Japanese prison got me down
Said I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Don't belong here, my eyes are round.
I had to stay home because my mother wasn't feeling well. She has the flu, and I wanted to take care of the house so she could stay in bed.  I just wanted to catch you guys to see if we were assigned any homework tonight.
Eeehh, I don't want to see a educational video-o. 
Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day!
Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.
But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.
Dude, Kyle. Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are.  Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive.  Kyle?
Oh Jesus, not you guys?  What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!
So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!
This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by  teh- ...tehhhh 
Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?!
Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him. 
I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box.  I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken-  AY! 
Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch.
The swimsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the candidates. 
Oh, here comes the unholy butthole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!
Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?
There's even World War Three to look forward to.
Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.
Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this??
You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this!
It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay. 
Really tough, you know. It's... really hard. It's like , we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures.
Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!
We have to rehearse all that we can!  Now, check this out:  My mom made us costumes!
What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?
Butters, I had to!Â Â Okay, I had to put it on the Internet!
Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes!  You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA!  You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else! 
All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.
Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!
Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.
This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.
Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they'll try to unfreeze me right away.  I have to be hidden.  That's good.  And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!
Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?
All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. 
I need you in my life, Jesus.
I can't live without you, Jesus
And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.
Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?!  Don't... touch us! We know what the Chinese are up to! We saw the Olympic Opening Ceremonies!  The gig is up! Everyone just s-step over to that wall!  I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them. 
You... your Mom said you could take three friends.
Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like, "Hey, get out of my ass you stupid rainbows!" 
I can't believe I got sent to the principal's office because of your stupid girlfriend!
Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!
I told them everything, you guys. It's over.
The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do!
Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars.
Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.
Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.
True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours.Â Â Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors.
Sorry guys, I gotta go. The world needs CartmanBrah.Â 
Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now.
How are we doing on those patties, Jew?
Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here.
Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday.  G-goodbye!  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.
What?? Eh...  hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free!
That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. 
I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh! 
That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look.  Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is.
It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.
We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!
You guys, we have to bring Christmas to those less fortunate!  Now come on!
THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?
Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house.  Get out of here!
Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face.
No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... puts a penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!
Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.
Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee.
'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.
Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone??
Oh crap, there's a bunch of them. Never mind.  Holy shit, they shot this guy.
But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight.  Of couse you don't have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation, they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership. Gaauu.  Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves.
I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now.
Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.
Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!!
Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?
I'm a little piggy; here's my snout.
Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.
I'm a little piggy; here's
- Aalrightalrightalright, now give me back my money!
I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop.
Oh right. Someone like me can be a NASCAR driver.  Look at me!  Do you really think someone like this can ever become an awesome, famous NASCAR driver? 
Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?
Baby?!  Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!
Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!
Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!
Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! 
Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.
Um... okay. How about this:  Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a... golden retriever, or something.
It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool?
Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you-
Oh. I don't know, Clyde Frog. I just am.
You guys, listen to this song I just wrote. It's called, "I Hate You Guys":
I hate you guys.
You guys are assholes.
Specially Kenny.
I hate him the most.
Okay now, let's try one all together:
I hate you guys. Come on, you guys know the words.
Specially Kenny.
You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts.  Kyle, Kyle no! 
Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.
Yes.  Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys? You can just...you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around,  or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters.
You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to! 
I'm happy that I totally got away with it.Â Â What's a 911 area code?Â Hello?
I wasn't picking it-I had an itch, for cryin' out loud!
No, it was just a dream, my mom said so.
Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us.
Sarque du Son Bleu.  Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain.
Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?
Yes. And I've learned something, too.  Being a sellout is sweet. Because you make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don't have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home.
Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split
They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?
Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow...
Aw, shut up, you freakin' hippies!  Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, amd you must refer to me as "Captain."
Okay okay, let's stop there for a minute. Remember, on tricka lahty do, that's a "lahty do" Okay, really need you guys to enunciate the "lahty" Uh, Nadif, if I can get you and Abdikaram to sing the harmony on the second "yo ho". And uh, Hashmish, is it? I'm sorry, but you're a little flat. Remember to sing out, don't close your throat, m'kay? So let's go from uh, bar 14. We'll pick up after the quarter rest. Ike? 
Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.
Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents!  And what did I tell you, Kyle?!  I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?! 
Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.
That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents?  Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We're not the ones bombing them now, we're- we're just kids.  There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault.
Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.
Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies!
Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?
You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said "Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone." But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way-  Oh, that's where I put those.  Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.  Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me. 
Deeper.  Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome.
What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why!
They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.
You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said.
Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, "Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!" Okay?
Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I watched it on YouTube about sixty times.
You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! 
Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!
Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!
Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.
And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! 
...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person.
Hehey, no no! We aren't the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam, okay?! That's their fault!
Hi guys!  Very Merry Christmas. God bless one, everyone! 
Goodbye Butters. I must be going now. I'll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters! Goodbye! 
He has to. He's been ordered by the court.
Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me!
I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.
Thank you! Thank you all. That's all I wanted to say. That and... The Bat-Mobile's outside.  Seriously guys, you gotta see it. The Bat-Mobile! It's outside.
Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.
Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...
Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it!
That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the tree! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it!  Did you see the scratch, Kenny?!
Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool. 
Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it!  Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! 
That's 'cause I was having these... bogus nightmares.
Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?!  Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle!
Uh oh, 5:30, time to pray.  Allah, Allah, m'heh
All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and get super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?! 
Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel? 
Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!
Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how "do" you act nice to people?
Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime!  Jesus Christ!  Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn!
Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters.  Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?
Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.
We have to get out of here! Now!  Kyle! Kyle!! 
There's nothing faggy about $10 million dollars, asshole! This was a message from God!
Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an overseer.
All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair  and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!
Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God!
Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?
Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean han.
Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone.  Dude, I'm on fire today!
Thank you. Thank you very much.  Thank you.
What, what is it? What is it for?
Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine?
I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time. 
Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to? 
I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie.
Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?
I don't think so, General Tso! This way, officers! 
I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. 
What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls?
Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS! 
Uugh!  Yeessss.  Ooohhh yyou guys, seriiously, it calms yer ass. Ahhhh... 
I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!
God, it's so hard to find good help.  Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?
Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?!
No. NOO!  I won't do it. I won't do it, you hear me! I'm better than this.  And to hell with you, Mr. Kitty. You're a bad kitty! Bad, bad kitty! It's time somebody stood up, and did the right thing. 
No I didn't. That was just my shoes.
"Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure."  Fuck you Milly, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch! 
I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about "protectin' the earth" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!
Oh, no.  Damnit!  No, Kitty! That's a-- Wait a minute. Come 'ere, Kitty!  Uh. Yes. Uh...
There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow.
Stan, don't you know the first law of physics? Anything that's fun costs at least eight dollars.
You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?
If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?
But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by.  You know the way out, right? 
Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!
You guys, I am seriously getting pissed off right now! I know there is no such things as aliens!  Oh, God damn it!
Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch!  You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness.
HÃ¶r zu, diese ganze Dinge ist ein Fehler. 
Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to-
Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.
Please don't call on me. Please, Jesus, don't let him call on me.
Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!
It's Adolf Hitler costume. Sieg Heil, sieg heil.
That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is so cool.
This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.  Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers. 
Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan.
Oh. I uh... well I ah ah  I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term "fag," Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante?  Kenny?
Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.
My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month.
Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!
I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass.  Shut up, you guys! It's not funny!
Mr. Loaf, we are selling candy bars for our dying friend.
Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!
Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butthole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!
Yeah,  So, what are the plans to take over America again? I fohgot. 
That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya!  Hahahaha ha ha!
Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.
Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!
And you! I should never have believed in you!
Hello. Is this the University of Colorado Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand you're currently doing research on stem cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in possession of some aborted fetuses that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty dollars a pound right now. ...How about a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my balls- I, I'll think about it.
Bosnod Medical Group? ...Yeah, I called earlier about the stem cells and the fetuses? ...Okay, hi Randy, yeah. ...Oh yes, they've been kept in a cool temperature, yeah. ...These are primo fetuses, Randy, I wouldn't jerk you around. ...So what can your company give me for 'em? ...Oh Randy, you're breaking my balls here. ...You're breaking my balls, Randy. 
Oh plehease! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses for seventy cents on the dollar? You tell me, Chuck? ...Yeah, I didn't think so-You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck. I wasn't born yesterday, either. Uh huh. ...So are you gonna talk to me, or are we just gonna keep bullshitting each other? Breakin' my balls, Chuck. 
I gotta unload these fetuses, you wanna do some research. Are we talkin' here or what? You're breaking my balls. ...I'm telling you, if you let this deal pass you by, you're making a fetal mistake.  That's a joke  ...A hundred ten. ...Alright, alright, we got a deal. ...Good bye.  Damn I'm good. 
They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.
You know goddamn well you are not Jennifer Lopez, so stop pissing me off! 
I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone! O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!
"Nothin'" Me neither. Nothin's goin' on. Sucks.  Everything good with you?
Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong?
Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school.
I'm prepared!  For my book report, I read The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. It was very, very good. Have you read it, Mr. Garrison?
That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West. 
Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives.  God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million dollars.
There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!
Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!
Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?
Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better.  Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we... 
Alright, fine! Here!  Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this! 
Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?!  Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?!  I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!
Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. 
That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there  if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.
Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence.
We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: "Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!"
Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.
This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth!  From with-
The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!
Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped?
No, no! Craig, you you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today.
No,  no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong.
Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?
Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen? 
I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers.  Alright, these are good to go! 
Uh, hold on just a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my payment?!  I'm not letting you guys screw me over again. Give me what I wanted, now!
What day is American invasion again? I fohget. 
Really? That's cool. When did-  What did you say?  Trent Boyett?! Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at us, Trent Boyett?!
Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break.
Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about!  Now come on, guys! If you wanna be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are!  Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys!
Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!
If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!
How do you know?! I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it.
All right, hang on. We're about to land.  Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.
We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit.
Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? 
He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us. 
I beg you to give me back my money.
Now, zap his hella ass back to your- hella universe!
Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, "hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!" 
Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play "Magic: The Gathering"?
Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you!  Iya!
Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off.
Oh Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.
Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing butâ¦Patrick Duffy.
Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?
And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?
We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.
Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?
He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time.
Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature.
What do you mean? This song is sweet.
I love you guys.  Ah, screw you guys(!)
Thank you, Rumpertumskin. And what do you think about me, Clyde Frog?
All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out! 
Did you guys see that? That was sweet.
They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of them tomorrow!
God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?
Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!
I think I only need a hundred or so more aborted babies,  and I can finish up the kitchen.
Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing!
That does it! I am suing you for sexual harassment!
All right, you ready?  All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go. 
Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho,  huhuh, he, haha.
No way! You gave it to us-it's mine now!
Damnit! I knew you'd say that! You always have it out for me!
Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, hun?! No! Not this time!  The school has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you!  You remember the school physical we all took last week?!
You know, jus'... layin' down some rhymes for G-folk, you know what I'm sayin'?
Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?
All right, that's good.  Okay, open your mouth, Butters?  That's good, just like that.
Here it is, my big moment of fame.
Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!
I'm gonna get her, Kitty! Mark my words!!  SHUT THE HELL UP, KITTY!! 
Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk.
Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price.
I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these. 
Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'll expect the same from you. 
Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents.
So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes?
Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?
I am the Dawg, the big bad-  Oh my God!  What the fuck is this?!
Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!
Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.
What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?!
Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean!
Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, "Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?" "Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman."  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!
Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die.
This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?!  You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.
You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.
Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?
Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you.
It's sad how jealous you are, Kyle. It really is.
Thanks Jody! Gingers, how are we feelin'?  Can I get a Red Power?
You got the money?Â Â Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point.
But my mom says you're the guy she was with.
That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!
Oh man, you've got to be kidding me. God damn Japs are everywhere. 
Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year.
Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg.
Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.
Psst Butters. Butters!  At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.
Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?
Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!
Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday.
O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! 
Well, right, or we could always do that.
Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make "quadruple stuffs."
Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.
So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh? 
I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!
Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person.
No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!
Hey, wait a minute!  You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it!
It's the right address-wait! Look there!  There's Mrs. Streible! This is the place. 
Not the next song, the next PERSON!  Aw, man, this is gonna be a long-ass day. 
Thank you, Stan.  Sh sh, here they come, here they come.  "And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?
Grrr. Jesus Christ I can't go on like this.  Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?
Hello, Mr. Hankey is appearing at the mall. Can somebody please take us?
Uncle Stinky, my stupid friends want to see Mr. Hankey! You have to take us!
Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm trending, Kyle. I'm trending more than I ecer thought possible.
Kenny, it doesn't go "Pakew! Pakew!", it goes "BANG BANG BANG!!" 
Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God.  Okay, okay, so get this, get this: The milk company calls me, right?  And they call me and say that two people from Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think it's their kid. 
Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations.
Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?!
Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.
They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey.
Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? 
Mmmath homework, Mmmath homework. Where did I file that?
No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno!
Marina del Rey
They're so nice to the homeless
built them port-a-potties
Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.
I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!
Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5  This is-oh my God, look at this you guys.  This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the rung just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello?
Hey, I was just about to do it.
The men are just inexperience, Sir Kyle. They need more training.
You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!
Oh wait, I get it now! The F-word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people. I'm sorry Momma.
That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.
Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah.  "Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire." Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!
Oh, I don't know, I guess I'll take that ring there.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!
I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles. 
Where the fuck did he go?!  Haha! Game over, Butters! You lose!  The fuck is this?!  No. NO! 
That's Kenny with branches on his head.  Why did you bring me all the out here, you guys?
All right, see you there!  Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!
Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?
Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry! 
Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack? 
Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh.
They look great on you, Butters. They really do.
I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!
Oh, I see. Now you're going to join in on the little joke huh?
Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens.  No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus.  Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.
Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America!
Clyde?!  The fuck are you doin'?! You just let a Mexican through!
Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! 
Stephen Tamil? The fifth grader?  Oh shit!  I told you to lock that door, Token!  No.  Nononono!  Where are they Kenny??!!
Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas!
Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a... boxer, or something.
But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line.
Come on, Stan, it's mine! I'll roshambo you for it! 
Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle. 
...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny.
Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. &lt;/&gt; There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top.  Good.
Who would have thought such a miracle could be?Who could have known that this moment I would see?A new way of living, a chance to be free?
There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. 
Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too.
Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise.
Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!
Oho! So you indeed me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset!
You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?! 
Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did.
Dude, do you wanna the Terranace & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that? 
Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes.
So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long!  Yeessss. Kyle's monneey. 
All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth.  God, this is gonna be hard to say.  I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change.  Help me change?
So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.
He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid.  Haha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican!
You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!
Boyarrrgh!  Ike Broflovski! You littering my hallway, brah?!
Yeeh, stealth bombers  Yeah, and talk about a bitch, I haven't seen-
No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.
Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!
Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.
Wow. What a day this has been. I was on TV, and, I'm a hero. 
Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!
Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.
Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again.  Friends, our school is dying and you know it. You feel it. You're like, you're like me; you wanna change it. But ohhh no, Wendy Testaburger's not gonna let that happen! This is not the school we grew up in, and ...and I don't know if we can get it back.  So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our school president ...wants to kill Smurfs.
Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass.
How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal!
Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom.
I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever...Â Â switch sides,Â Â it could make Stan's army problematic for us.
I was um, sure that the appointment was today.
Clyde Frog! Clyde!? Clyde Frog?!  Clyde. CLYDE FROG! 
Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.
Shhh, Kenny...  Old Ken is taking it especially hard. He's always loved dolphins so much that he-  Yeah yeah but, but keep it in a two-shot, though.  Yeah, keep it there.  He's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything.
Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys.
Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good.
Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense?
Please, I have to talk to you all right now!
Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker.  This is going swimmingly. 
Man, your family sucks ass, Kenny. Whoever heard of frozen waffles for dinner?
That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.
Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?
Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert! 
Dude, you know what? Japanese people really do not like whales.  Uh oh.
Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!
Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you now.
I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene.
Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics.  Bull's eye!
And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.
I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters,  Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents.
Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights!  Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! 
Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow. 
What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that?
The smurfs and I grew to understand each other.  They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette.  We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion.
and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.
Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.
Dear Mr. Hansen, 
I have Tourettes and I want the world to understand what it's like. Won't you do a special report on me so that the world can learn to ACCEPT us instead of just laugh? Donkey Boner!!! 
Eric Cartman
No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!
Detective Sandy Vagina here  thinks that "shit" might have something to do with everyone getting sick.
Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!
I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now,  I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here!
Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen!
You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!
Oh my God! You guys have to do something!
Nobody's gonna know. We just drive it around the marina real quick. Look, if anything happens, I'll take full responsibility.
You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?
Oho yes! I did it I did it!
But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!
Yuhwell, you're not dreaming!  Ey! Cut the crap!
Dude, dude! Check it out! This is the sweetest thing I've ever done!
Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?
Shotgun! It's my car, I call it first: shotgun!  Kenny, I called it shotgun!  Dammit, Kenny, get in the back!  Hey, Kenny, there's a sale on orange jackets over there.  Look, Kenny, there's an elephant parade!  Ken-ny. Kenny, look. Look! Go get it! , Go get it!  ha ha ha, you poor piece of crap. 
Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable.  Let this be our final battle.  Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah!  Ugh. Kyle! Stop it!
Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out.
Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!
That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade.
That's right Stan.  It's a cash cow, I tell you.
I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure.
I ain't helpin' crap!  I want to eat some paeh.
That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday.
Hi, Jakov.  What the hell is that?  Who's laughing?
My potty? What are they going to do to it? 
I'm juh duh duh duhhh! Do you know why you're a hallway monitor?! Because you don't have any friends! You should kill yourself! You should kill yourself!!
I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?
It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again.
Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!
If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down!
Go on! Walk the plank, you scurvy dog!
How about we do a show where we kill Butters? 
Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.
Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale.
This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on! 
It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh...
Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too.
Yes, Kyle.  The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal.
I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out.
Hey, I know! Let's go play laser tag at FunPlex.
This is killing me. The human body was not meant to move quickly like that.
I told you guys. I've been watching all day.
Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday... 
"My arms hurt." Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business! 
That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!
Thank you! Number twenty-four?  You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go!
Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.
Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.  Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?  You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.
I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?
Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!
Hey hey, how's it going, bros? This is CartmanBrah.Â CartmaaanBrah. And uhh, we are, it looks like we are at the bus stop now.Â Â Yep, there's Kyle, Stan andn Kenny looking stupid as ever.
You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass!
Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now?  Kyle, where are you going?
I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.
You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues
All right, hit one out of the park!
Yeah, well, that why they call is Asspen. 
Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.
That's awesome. I'm so stoked that we're best friends.  Fist bump.  Fist bump. 
Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?
I told you guys. The holiday season is nothing but lies and bullcrap!
Oh, it looks like you finished your Fudgecicle, Elvin.  God damnit, be quiet, Elvin! Shut up, Elvin!  No, Elvin, bad Elvin! 
Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!
I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you?
...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always been sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I- I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know.
U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!
You know we might not even make it into the studio.
Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!
Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle.
I'm gonna go take care of this prick!
I've worked it all out on Expedia.  We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want.
Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw.  We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico!
I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town.  At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.  Then I saw this...  Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... . hippie music festival.
What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people.  What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?!
Yeah?  Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what I'm getting.  The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000.
Ooohh, I love whole new levels! This is gonna be so totally awesome!Â CartmaaanBrah!
This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot! 
Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle?
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh wicky wicky Wild West!
Shelly, guess who's busted!  Hey! I said, guess who's busted!  Eh, you're not gonna trick me, I've got the goods on you!
I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks!
Every time I go to my Grandma's house, she gives me a present. You watch: as soon as I walk in the door she'll hand me a biiig present, for no reason, except that I'm cool.
Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!
Excuse me...  This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?
Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride!
...I'm gonna be on television, I'm gonna be on television...
Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm. 
Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.
Dude! Dude! DUDE!  The fuck are you doing?!
I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!
Dah, give me that!  Talk to me Mike.
Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. 
Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping.  Dammit!  Kyle, wait I-  Kyle, hold on a second!
Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.
Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.
I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy.
I have the power to have all the powers I want.
Ogh! Now I'm gonna kick my friend Kyle in the beanbag and see what happens, by crikey!
God damnit, you're supposed to trade those, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!
Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion but-
Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-in', ring ting tingle-in' too Outside it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, and you, and you.
Oh my God! I'm a black African American!
Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales!
Screw you guys, screw you guysScrew you guys, scr--
Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth! 
Well do you mind tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig?
Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other.
You see I told you guys!  What's the use? It just, it's hopeless! 
Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who's got Skidmarks Monday.
They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand! 
Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down.
I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.
Dude, we need your turkey for our play!
Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how good she looks.
You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too.
Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.
This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore.
No! Uh-I mean, eh, why would they do that?
WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!
Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways!  Screw you guys, I'm goin' home!
I just wanted to remind you that I'm gonna be on television tonight, so be sure to watch.
You guys, shut up. I'm not under alien control.
I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
I'll be there, Kyle
I swear  like a shadow that's by your side
Kyle, swear to God I'll be there.
For better or worse , till death do us part 
I'll love you with  every gay beat of my heart!
Butters, you have screwed me out of a prize for the last time! 
Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!
That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is so funny!
No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, "Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?" And I was all like, "No way!" And this little light went on in my head like, "Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin." But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  What a misunderstanding, huh? 
Oh, hey, What's goin' on? I'm uh, here for the party.
Silver Bells, Silver Bells, it's Christmas time in the city...
Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else.
Hey, that's bullcrap! How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?!
But what does he do besides that he's cute?!
All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do. 
Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.
No, because people know I'm not fat! I'm buff. They probably put you at the bottom of the list because you have fucked up teeth! Or Kenny cause' he's poor
We have a deal, Blavius. As long as I get what I want, you have nothin' to worry abuot. 
I do not directly say she's a slut!
And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs!  Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD.  The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?
This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright.
Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.
Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money.
Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls?
Whatever. All I know is that I can laugh again. I'm gonna go home and eat another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny! 
Yeah. Somebody need sto put him in him place!
Hahaha, look at kyle, brahs. he's all pissed off.Â CartmaanBrah!
Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!
But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars?
Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?
I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!
...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism.
Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.
Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts! Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts! I'll kick you in the nuts!
No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries.
Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit. 
Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.
At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?!  What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies!
It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.
Hey you guys. This is just like that one movie, um, John Travolta and that, French chick were doing it, all summer long and went back to school and sang songs about "Greased Lightning."  You know, that movie where Sandra Dee thinks she's all prissy, and then they try and try to get an abortion, but she doesn't have all the-
Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call him Ben Assfleck.  Ben Assfleck, say that's funny.
Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.
But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?
Hi Ellen.  Do you guys like fishsticks?  Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you.
Look: you can stay over nyah , but I'm going over nyah. 
That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look.  Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar?
It puts the lotion back in the basket!
What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated. 
Look, look how his face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!
Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound? 
NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!
Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?
Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now.  Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha- 
Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.
Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like.
You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class.
All that treasure.  It's all mine!  So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it!  You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys!  Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass!  Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing. 
According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.
I'm sorry, Principal Victoria. I didn't mean to do it, how could I have been so foolish?
How about a taco, that craps ice cream?  Guys?
This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.
Ey! Don't call me fat!  Mom, don't laugh.
The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?!
Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass. 
No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!
Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros!
Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started.
And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight! 
I'm back own the track.  What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?!
Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.
It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!
Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle?  Eh. K-Kenny, you see that chick on the news that had her left titty cut off?  Kenny? Kenny??  Stan? Stan, it's me, Eric!  Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty cents?  Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm right here!  Wha...? How did...? Like they couldn't see or hear me. It's almost as if I were...  dead.  No. No, I can't be dead.  I can't be dead!!
Plunder the booty, lads! This ship is ours!
Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!
How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?
YOU GUYS! Oh my God, you guys!  You're never gonna guess what!  Seriously you guys, guess what??
I know you're trying to make me feel better, Kyle, but a rich smart kid has no place on a racetrack. 
Shhh. Be quite, you guys!  Hello, is this Maury Povish?  Oh, well who the hell are you?  Oh. Well I'm calling about your ad for freaks?  Ye-right, people with disabilities?  Yeah, I have a friend; he has a deformity; I think he'd be perfect for your show.  Great!  Hih-his condition?  Uh, he has a condition called "chinballalitis."  Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin.  Shut uh- shut up you guys.  Yes.  Yes, of course he's very upset about it.  Yes, he cries all the time.  Miserable, uh huh.  You wha- Really?
I'm making it look like important people call us.
What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way weÂ canÂ get the new gaming system.
Oh really?  Then, why don't you hold it?  Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it.  Hold it.
We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line.  That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and...
Fish dicks! Aw dude, that's funny as shit! I think we're really onto something here. Let's try it out on the guys.
I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics.  Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety.
...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda! 
I don't want powdered donut pancake surprise. All the kids at school call me fat!
I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides.  Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!
Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up. 
Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well.
Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh. 
No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.
Come on guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes! 
Digital malcontent now at parameter alpha. Prepare for full graphic interfaces on my mark: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,Â Mark.Â 
I'm gonna get those killer sai.  Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken  for a dollar ninety nine.
I found this in the hallway.  Apparently your student Ike has a crush on you.  You got a crush on your teacher, brah?! Keep it out of my hallway! Go with Christ. Here you go. 
So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?
That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!
Shut your goddamn mouth.  We have Nilla Crunchies, Berry Bars--
I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to.  You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called "having your cake and eating it too."
Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. uh watchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it.
Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?
Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip.
I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.
Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!
Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.
Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you. 
Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.
Stan, if you're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd like to go now, please?
All right, bring out...! The other male cat. 
You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny!
Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!
NO! No I don't wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT! 
Hey, hey, what's going on?!  Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?!
Alright lads, guess we'll have to settle with this meager ship. Two of you sit aft and two of you sit in the front.
Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns  and 800 points. 
Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing! 
Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000.
That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.
Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-
Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.
I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go!
What what?  Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning!
Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!
The torso he would dump into the lake. 
You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel.
Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime.
Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick?  When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water,  and you put their hand in it... 
Yes! We've had a new time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck  Au revoir, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen? 
Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?
Thanks.  So, what I'm thinking is, "Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?" 
Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines.
Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't!
Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.
You see Token, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... Seeing African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha, how should I say... white.  Token, all the great African-Americans newspeople have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings.
With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again , proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!
Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that your parents think that you're in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're both screwed! 
Yes, but I'm not going to die.  That's why we gotta get along, people!
...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex.
One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message!  Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world!  Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!
Well, looks like once again, the Dawg has prevailed. I hope you've learned, kids, that if you don't go with Christ, you could end up just like that splattered bitch down on the pavement.
That's fine! That's fine!! Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan!  Fuck you, Tweek!  Bebe, you're still cool. 
Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?
Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?
Let's punch this baby.  We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on.  Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status?
But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?
Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the balls!  Kyle!  Quit it, Kyle. Give it up, Kyle!  Okay... Okay! Okay okay!  You win! You win. I give up.  Hahaha! I had my fingers crossed. 
Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE.
Dolphins, eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap!
All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right?  I think I figured out how to do it.
Come to try and stop me?!  It isn't gonna work. 
This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now.
Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now.
My God, he's right.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death.  Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys.  Except for you, Kyle.
After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again!
Wiffle ball, anyone?  Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?
We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!
Shh!  I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer.
It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool.
Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?!
It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.
You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.
Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? 
Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later!  Aw, man, this is so tits!
You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing!
Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?
Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life.
He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people. 
Well, think about it.Â Â The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by.
I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!
Interesting.  Ooo, Stan's asthma inhaler. I want that. 
I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath. 
The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! 
Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy.
You're the crappiest band I have ever heard!
Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over!
Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture.  I got my period, and you guys didn't. I got my period, and you guys didn't. 
Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?
You scared the crap out of me, Ike!
Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team.  And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters. 
Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girls shitter.
It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.
Hello, puhree! Puhree hello! Hello, sucky-sucky! Hello, puhree!
Hah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you.  Ow! My ass! 
Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril.  Come on, ninjas!
Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.
So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue.
Ohh, rainbows. Yeah, I like those, those are cool.
Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!
Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls!
Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on! 
But mom, me and Artemus Clyde Frog still have to do our love scene with Salma Ha-yek.
That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve.
Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become.
Come on buddy.  Get out of here!  Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight!  Fight! Fight! Right now!  Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight!  Fight!  Give him some air.  There, easy. Breathe easy. 
Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week.  And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog.  And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of-  -eh- Ow!  D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow!  Eh! Oh! Help.  Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!
I see the questions in your eyes.
I know what's weighing on your mind.
You can be sure I know, my heart.
Girl I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear (I swear) like a shadow that's by your side (Keep it down, girl)
I'll be there
For better or worse (better or worse), till death do us part (death do us part)
I'll love you with every black beat of my heart
And I swear. I swear. I s-we-e-e-ear Yeah, I swear. Straight up. What it do?
If we can hold on to the night.
We've got to find our way together...
I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.
Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina.
Sir, could you step out of the car, please?
The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.
And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff. 
Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home. 
Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?
Yeah, stupid.  Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's body is big enough for the both of us.  Shut up, Kenny.
Now you say, "It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again."
Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser  so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5.
Welcome to this performance of Wrestling Takedown Federation: Smackdown. 
This is for your own good, Brother Kyle.
Look at that guy. He's like 40, but he's got a Justin Bieber haircut.
Fuck you, Danica Patrick! You ain't half as dumb as me! Gas pedal! 
That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face!
Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!
"Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes."
How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?
Mr. Kitty, shhh!  Damn it!  Shhh, Mr. Kitty you have to be quiet, or else they're gonna find you.  What?!  It's the neighbor cat. He hasn't been caught yet.  No- no, Mr. Kitty. I know you like Rufus, but he has to fend for himself.  I can't hide anymore cats, Mr. Kitty.  I'm in trouble enough as it is.  All right, all right, fine. 
I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?
Why, thank you, Polly Prissy Pants. How nice of you. 
Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!
I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.
Wait, hold on, can we take a break?
Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!
What kind of video did you guys make?
Oh dude!  Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas!
Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast!  Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends!  Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon.  You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why?  Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.  If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street.  The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger  So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle.
It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities!
Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler.
I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.
Oh my God! Butters!  I feel kind of stupid!
I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant.
Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.
Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots.
Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken.
The FUCK?!  'Scuse me, where are the pirates?  Hey, hey we're looking for the pirates? Where can we find the-uh!  Butters, get the phrase book out.  Ask these people where the pirates are.
Oh yeah, I guess that doesn't make sense. 
All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow!  Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde!  Clyde! Clyde, you asshole!  Goddamnit we lost Clyde!
Whoa, dude, look over there!  Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!
You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives.
How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.
Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.
I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold!
My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, don't ye. Well let me get right down to it theyen. Like yourself,  I am also in the slave trade.  But at the moment I find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin' if you could share some secrets.
Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That's my cell phone.  Hello? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is.
Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?
Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! 
Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.
Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. 
I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months.
We're tradin' paint!  Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!
Why, thank you, Peter Panda. This is Distinctive Earl Grey.
He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.
I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!
Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?
We've got to fight them off!  Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!
I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem. 
Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!
Yeah, well, at least  it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease.
You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me.
You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like,  "my parents molestered me."
No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? "Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight." It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!
Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard.
Yeah! Now get out of here before I kick you in the nuts!
Yeah, come on, let's go!  I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!
Here you go.  I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat.
So... so then, how can you feel bad?
Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend!
Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!
Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.
Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!
But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault!
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess!
Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.
You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!
Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- "student atheletes" then?
The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...
Ooo, ah, that's a different company.  Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! Â­Â¡Vamonos!
Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.
What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then.  Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away?  Gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.
Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things!
If anybody calls or comes over, I'm not here, okay?
Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.
Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?!
Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, "How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't  gonna  work  on  me  ha  ha  ha . Only one of us can be in the commercial, gentlemen. The game... is on. 
Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward.  NASCAR! Yee-ah!
Step back! Tell those men to step back!
Right, and wi-  Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle.
Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.
And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...
What has happened to this place?
I donât recognize it anymore.
It used to be so fun and special.
What is life worth living for?
The dream is dead, our land is gone;
Thereâs a hole in my heart and I canât go on.
There are too many minorities (minorities)
At my water park (my water park).
This was our land, our dream (our dream),
and theyâve taken it all away.
They just keep coming and coming (minorities).
I tried to go and tell the police,
But even the authorities
Are minorities
At my water park.
Thereâs no place for me to sit anymore,
And the lines just keep getting crazier.
There are Mexicans all around me.
The lazy river has never been lazier.
Itâs a 40 minute wait to go down one slide,
And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!
Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle?
No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes.
I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies...  After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili.  Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott?  I call it, "Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."
Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody.
Dude, look! There's everyone's backyards!Â Â Dude there's Craig's house! That's Craig's house!
Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way. 
Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! 
So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!
That's it! Get in there you swarmy dogs!  Lower 'em down, Ike. 
Oh I get it.  This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!
Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy?
Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away.
Oh, it's about freakin' time you showed up! You don't want me, you want that impostor Cartman! Come on, I'll show you. 
I suppose your socks smell like the Botanical Gardens!
Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters?
Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch! 
Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field.  I have a question. What does Wendy Testaburger actually do? She is supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let's ask these questions.  Today I wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy. The bake sale last week was a complete failure. And in the school-  And besides that, who actually voted for Wendy Testaburger? I know I didn't. And everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' "Whoops. Guess I shouldn't have done that."  I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school.
Oh, excellent! They're taking us to a ship. Once we commandeer our vessel the plundering will be easy indeed, lads. 
I just finished planning a brilliant  li'l scheme  that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars. 
When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?
A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!
What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?
What? That your parents lied to you, too?
Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?!
Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!
Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle,  I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.
Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.
Me and my crew are gonna go on piratin' forever! 
Oh, you didn't get a special Chinpokomon game controller. T-heh heh heh heh. Jehesus C-hrist! 
Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad.
Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?
I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid.
Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!
Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!
Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Turd Sandwich."
Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown.  Everyone's gonna be there!
Uh, everyone, tweet now if you wanna get rid of PewDiePie!
I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded! 
Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who my father is, I just have to. Maybe I can work in a sweatshop for a while uh...  Well, see you guys. I'm gonna go stay in my backyard for a while.
"Or does she?" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!
You know what we gotta do, guys?  We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party
There's one problem.  You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything.
Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!
Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.
I know, right?Â Â A big rally to tell the government to stay out of our private lives! I'm gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages!Â Â I seriously feel like I'm being spied on right now.Â Â I'm sure the government has a file on me a mile long; that's why this is so important, you know?Â Â Hang on, I'm gonna make a video blog for my "Stop Listening To Me" Web site.Â Â What's up everybody? It's me again, just kicking it at my skeal. There's gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! Gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it's top secret!Â  You guys gonna update your blogs too?
Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time.
Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy!
No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...
Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca.  We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. 
I am Department of Interior guy, and I have authoritah!  No! Jakov, don't go!
Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?
The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.
Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies!
You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours.
Okay. No first graders around. I can swim to the deep end.  Yeah... I can do it. I can do it. I can-- I'm gonna make it. 
All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.
Hmmm. I wonder what I should do with my triangle, now that it is mmyy triangle.
Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!
The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well.
And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints , and a guitar! 
You don't owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean. 
Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors.
We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?!
That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me.
Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence.
Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick.
Heh! Yeah, right! You guys could kiss my black ass!
Hey Stan.  Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?!
What if you didn't have to give it up?
Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!
Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five?
That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass!  I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over!
You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?
Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence.
Ehyeah, sure. Ah I do crack and pot pourri, and queazies
But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus!
Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket.
I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!
Yeah I'm good. How are you, Kyle?  They're all gonna pay! Every day they pushed me and pushed, and if it happens again today, it's going to be the last time.  We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess.
Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?
Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea  that I'm actually working for the Wall-Mart to stop you from succeeding!
My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday.
I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you.
Happy holidays, everyone! Â Enjoy the rest of your lives with CartmanBrah.
Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.
He used to be fat but not no more 
You know, there's really only two seasons here in South Park: Winter, and July, heh heh heh. But, but um, seriously, South Park has always been a place of discovery for me...  Ey, you sons of bitches! Get back here! I'm having a god-damned distinctive honor!
This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.
JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY!  It's Stan's stupid Captain America costume! That's what's throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to get that I'm the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?! 
Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him.
You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out?
You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society.  Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today?
Will he bleed? That's all we care about.
I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!
Quiet, you sons of biscuit eaters! This boat is now pirate propertih! Now get ye to your lifeboat, lest you wanna be shark bait!
I don't Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.
Ehey hey, how's it going bros? This isÂ CartmaaanBrah! And it looks like we're in the producer's office in Los Angeles now.Â 
Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.
Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?
I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!
Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.
Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all.  And get some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass!
Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it! 
Aw, damnit!  Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes! 
Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brakes! Bye Kenny. 
That does it!  I do not need to sit here and be ridiculed! I'm gonna go be home-schooled from now on!
And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could even be a spy!
How do I reeeach these keeeeds?!  Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, "Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat." You know what happened?  They lost.  Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives.
We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer about the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that's supposed to play during the commercials.
Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?!Â 
And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?
Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!!
Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy on everyone!
I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh?
Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume. 
Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed.
Alright are you ready to try this, guys?
It's sooo amazing!  You spin this thing on the ground and it goes 'round and 'round. I could watch it aaall day!
Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!
But if I'm not the most out-of-control teen, I might not win the prize.  Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe?
I hope we're not wasting our time with this little pecker.
We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick! We didn't feel like it!
Man, you guys are hella stupid! If I had money, I wouldn't give it to you assholes!
I am not going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters!
Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. 
What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!
No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on! 
Are you guys nuts?! After everything we've gone through!?
Sure. 
Here's a little dreidel that's small and made of clay.
But I'm not gonna play with it, 'cause dreidel's freakin' gay.
Hey, get offa him! He's not dead yet!
Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too.
Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway!
So? I'm hotter than Kyle.  I'm better looking than Kyyyle!  Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!
"It isn't safe." That's not what you said back in the cafeteria, Kyle. In the cafeteria you said Somalia was "awesome."
Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.
Tell me where the gold is or you die!  Slow! 
There, you see? My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!  What, Red?! You're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?! I don't care!  Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea!
Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them.  Here, put these teeth in!  And just say "herro" and "prease" a lot.  "Oh, herro prease." Ping pong ching chong.
You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?
Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy.
Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever.
I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.
Yeah. Too bad they have the personalities of a wet dishcloth. 
All right, fine Wendy!  I'll fight ya you big bully!
And...
''O Holy Night, the stars are brightly shi-ning
It is the night of our dear Savior's b-b-b-birth
O Holy Night, the- something, something, dis-- aah.
It is the night with the Christmas trees and pie.
Jesus was born, and so I get presents.
Thank you, Jesus, for being born. (Wo-o-o-o-o)
Fall (Fall) 
On your knees (On your knees) 
And hear (Can't you hear)
The angels'.. something (Voices)
O night (O night)
Divine (Divine)
The night
When I get presents (O-o)
O night (O o-night) 
Di-viiine! 
O night (Ooo-ooo)
O night, di-vine! 
Oh. Ah. Ch.
Or, in other words, I'll let this jagu-ar bop me in the face and see if it hurts. Come on, jagu-ar, let's see what you've got!  Aaah! Ow, son of a bitch! 
Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!
Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind?
There's fear and darkness all around you
The criminals are on the run
No use in not having your hall pass
I'll take you to the principal 'cause I'm the Dawg
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg
The Hallway Monitor!
Hi there, folks! This is a heck of a storm out now! Thought maybe you could use some provisions.  There's some candles and food in there. It ain't much, but it should get you through the night. Take care, folks. I've got other houses to get to. 
Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.
You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old.  I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.
Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach. 
Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk
Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly! 
But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank!
The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say "You slept with my girlfriend," and I'll charge you into a head slap.
Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!
What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.
I've got to buy Chinpokomon... I've got to... buy them... Must buy Chinpokomon...
Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.
Token, stop giving Tyler Perry money or he won't go away!
Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!
Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit.
Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth.
Damn, I'm pretty freakin' cool all of a sudden.
No, you CAN'T go.  Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out
Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?
Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world.
No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am! 
We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus! 
All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Token?!  I didn't think so! 
How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door?Â 
Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again!  But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas!
I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.
I guess- we might as well- go home now. 
I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem?  It's called "I Was Not The Bullet." 
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the juror that set the shooter free.
I was not the trigger. I was not the hate.
Nor was I the judge, but still, you judge me?
I was not the black family mourning for the dead.
"Oooo, somebody shot our children. Lordy, what we do now?"
I was not the verdict.
I'm not fat! I just haven't grown into my body yet, skinny bitch!
Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! 
Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2!  When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur,  but when I computer-enhanced it,  You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.
Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache.
How much further to Ottawa! Christmas is only twelve hours away.
No Mom, you don't understand! I've been waiting for this thing to come out for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It's like... waiting for Christmas... times a thousand.
Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.
Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?!
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me-hee
What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle.
Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation!
Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.
Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?!
Yes.  And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle.  Good luck. 
Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a great mother.  Such a beautiful mother.
Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye. 
That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!
Dude, screw this!  Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!
I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind.
Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over?
Oh I'll find it, don't worry!  God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously.
Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!
Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom!
Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't.
What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!
Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead!  Ow!
Oh my God,  it smells like ass out here.
We did it!  So long, Trent! Have a nice time!  Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!  Hahahahahaaahaaa! 
Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.
HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash!
Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well?
Well, Stan, thanks a lot for having such a cool uncle that got us all detention for a week.
I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage.  This has to be stopped, you guys.
Bye bye Billy.  Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good.
Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?!
Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! 
So if we make Butters up to look like a dog...
Alright y'all, keep your eyes peeled and your guns ready.  There's a heap of Mexicans out there who want nothin' more than to sneak past our border, and we've gotta stop them!
Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness. 
Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off.  Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now.  Here. Write a diary.
Can you tell me where the pube fair is?
Stan? Stan, come on. We're gonna go find a frog. 
Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay! 
Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together!  This is gonna be tits!
Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?
Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys?
Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever!
All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out! 
Attention! Attention please!  This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it!  Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands!  Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle. 
The other way to stop the outbreak. Token isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida!
You just want me to open the door!
There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!
Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming.
Sally. Sally Struthers. The lady on TV. She knows everything. Sally Struthers.
Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!
Okay, we need to start immediately, please.Â Â Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight!
Don't try to change the subject, Kyle.  You've done a really good job of getting out of this bet, but it's finally time to settle. Get ready for your sundae, Kyle. With extra nuts. 
It had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding, huh?
Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore.
Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says "We need to talk" you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude.
Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce!  Oh God yes!  Where did you get that?!
That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off.  Don't you guys know anything?
You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your pants.
Uh, Butters, I don't know how to tell you this, but, Lisa Berger is going out with Clyde.
My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds.  I love Kenny McCormick and...  I want you to love him too.  And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song 
It was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment shone in your eyes
I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
A dark wizard must be trying to stop us!
When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.
I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?
People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?
Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off...  That's a dude jacking off...
If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left!  Black guy in the back!  Alight, now let's find Zimmerman.
He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!
But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?
You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight! 
Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar.
Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang. 
Alright, stop, stop, stop!Â Â This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot!Â 
Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh.  Ogh! Wait-
Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls.
Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it! 
Not much, just taking my  one million dollars out of the bank. 
God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!
In the ghetto
On a cold and gray Chicago morn 
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto... In the ghetto
So then, we are all going to need some... more tea.
Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here.
I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.
How about we sing "Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch", in D minor.
Oh, awesome!!  Excuse me, excuse me? Can I get to eat some of your-  Thank you. Thank you.  Oh, I've got to get to Black Bart's Cave!  Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me! Coming through to Black Bart's Cave!  Oh!  Oh, scary! Look, a skeleton!  Oh man, I'm so scared!  Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers!  Come on! Come on, dive!  Dive, asshole!  Oh, awesome! That was cool, huh?  Whoa.  Sopapillas! Can I get some sopapillas please?!  Sweeet!  Oh! Booth! Puppet show! Puppet show! 
Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you.
Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us! 
Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!
Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there.
I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere.
You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time.
It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away!
Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott!  Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet.
I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?
You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian.
It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!
Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent film that  isn't about gay cowboys eating pudding!
Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!
Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls. 
Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle.
GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! 
You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can prove you had a boyfriend over heuh!
Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!
Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country.
Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you.
No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool! 
Oh! Oh, I'm a I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez?  Is it a coincidence that they ended up together?!
They'll be done.  Â¿Que paso? Â¿Que paso?  All right, did you read the book?
Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week.
Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.
This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys.
Really?  Hey, there's a frozen guy down there.
So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, "I'll smash your teeth in!" My head is all like gashed open.
Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!
I'm alive!  I'm alive, you guys.  I don't know how, but I'm alive!  Can you believe it? It's a miracle.  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.
Friday?! Aw, Jesus!  I'll just... sort of get in here- in here. 
More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring.
There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?!
Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this.
All right, this should keep my cat in place while he spreads the urine.  Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? 
...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day...  Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to...  God-damnit!  Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today! 
Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.
Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski!
Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!
Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick.
Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you.
Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine ceeeents?  Wall-Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you again?  Yes, Wall-Mart. I understand. 
Hello, is this the Maury Povich show?  Yes, I'm calling because I saw your television program, and I also have balls hanging from my chin.  I'd like to come in and talk about my disorder and perhaps get a free trip to the largest putt-putt golf course in the world?
What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!
...I've never heard the words "only" and "candy" in the same sentence before.
Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.
Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon frÃ¨re!
Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.
It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am going to lead you there!
You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?
Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!
- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -
Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die! 
Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?!  Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!
He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!
Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.
You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?
Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it.
Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes!  I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance.
It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?
Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks! 
Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-
Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?
All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black. 
Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it!
I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?
This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line!
Did you notice the bow?  I'm not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth, so I'm exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice. Now get out of my way. I have to take a shit.  Aaahhh!
How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippy!
Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.
Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?
You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.
That is really starting to piss me off.
Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.
It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.
Why does Grandma have to live so far away? Why don't we just stick her in a nursing home closer to us so  I don't have to drive six hours to get a god-damned present?!
I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.
Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer "bad touch."
Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck my car.
â¦TouchÃ©. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, justâ¦ tell me what to do, and I'll do it.  Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih.  Wendih. Seriouslih.  The Bog Monster speaketh.
Doodoo doot doo, dadadadada daa, ya da dadaa
Doodoo doot doo, dadada daa,
heydy heydy heydy,
how's it goin', guys?
Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?!  No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard!  No! 
Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.
You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a winner...
I get to wear it first, you guys.
Â¿Que paso? Â¿Que paso? Looking for work? SÃ­? Trabajo?
It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole!
Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it.
Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!
No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems.
Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have?
I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.
Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!
Heh.  Mom! Uh I can explain. It was all Shelly's fault! She didn't watch the cat!
Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!
I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble if you don't-! Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine fine!
Hey you guys. Can we order a pizza?
Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world!
No no! He's my son! I adopted him.
Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before.
Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us "genetically inferior." The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are!
Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
He's a little wuss, what's it look like? 
I can not possibly eat one more bite of its chocolaty goodness. Oh, but but but, but I'll try.
That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch! You need some Goddamned lasik surgery!
That's right... That's right!  Ohhh.  I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you.
It's "Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis" funtime game. You have to decide if you deny it or cover it up.
Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny!
Oh, shut up guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working.
Okaaay.Â Â I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon.
We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.
Guys? Guys!  Oh it's true! You all did survive!
Thank you.  Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative.
Alright, that does it!  I'm sick of this shit and I'm not gonna be  taking it any longer!  You all pushed me to this! 
Could you turn up the heat just a little?
Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!
Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.
It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!
Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take.
DÃ¼rfen wir der Kind dort..  ...geboten?  VoilÃ , er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schÃ¶ner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhÃ¼bsch, wunderhÃ¼Ã¼Ã¼bsch. 
Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?
Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends! 
Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?
This is the reason why our living rooms are dying, so we've got to do something.
So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker.
Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys. 
Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you!
God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars.
Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!!  Then... that...  Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!! 
In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. My only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here.  If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system.  Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all.
CartmaaanBrah! Dude, check it out. Lady Gaga is singing Christmas songs. Isn't she a Jew?
Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture?
Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five.  On your American Express.
Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest?
But  I'm gonna need your help.  Can you get psyched?? Are you gonna get  psyched up??
Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack? 
But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee. 
Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all "my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that." But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay?  See? You can't remember.
Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today.
Yeah, huh?  It-it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah!
Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? "Big titties! Buttmunch!" There's no walls anymore! "Shit!" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. "I wet my bed last night." 
Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?
It's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squah-o-lantern, Kenny?! That's hella stupid!
What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get?
Dude, I couldn't take anymore of that balloon. Another couple hours of that, and I would've been totally pissed off.
YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?
We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas.  That means we have to be back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark.
Oh fuck.  Oh what's the- God damn it!  Hello?
Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!
Sir! Sir!  If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you.  Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.
By who? Goddammit Garrison, who is my father?
Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!
We gotta get serious while weâre in our prime.
See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys. 
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Let me get my coat. 
So how long until we can joke about it?
This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?
Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?
Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!
Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.
This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole!  I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate people.
Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit.
Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!
Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place  in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please! 
Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?
Juden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Juden est verboten, God dammit!
I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now!
Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand!
Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?
You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man.
It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out.Â Â Dude, no way! This thing is so epic!Â 
When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind.
But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong. 
Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!!  You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!!  AAAAAA!! 
Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!
How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond.
Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood.
It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.
Yeah well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Token.  He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in.
Ma? I just dreamt that me and Stan and Kyle and Kenny were trapped on our bus, and we were talking about everything that happened to us, except that it was all wrong and everything ended with us eating ice cream.
Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all!
Eheh. You got in trouble, you got in trouble.
No no, wait a minute! If... if she's my dad, then... who's my mom?!
Yes! That's three homeless! Suck on that! Fuck yeah! 
Eh, not right this second, mother. Put them there by the door.
You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?
Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!
No, no, wait, you don't understand.  since I was th-three years old it has been my dream to have one million dollars...
I want a part in the new movies!
Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him.  Zi-  Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross.
But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.
I am a little piggy. Ey!  That does it! Mom!
You guys see me block that defense today, I was kicking ass.
You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?
Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin! 
Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two.  Eeyy!
Ey! Get out of here, PewDiePie! This is MY holiday special!
Oh my God, this can't be happening!  Mom? Mom's crying? Oh God, it is true!  Oh, it's not fair!  Why??? Why??? 
Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, "Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?" Right?
You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!
You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again!
Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?
What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!
Mm, succulent and juicy.  Can we have a free sample of these, too?
Yup, looks like I'm gonna be rich.  And famous.
Whoa! Cooool!  Oh wooow! No waaay!  It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!!
Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! 
Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!
Haahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us! 
Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching murder porn, and now they're screwing up Minecraft too!Â 
Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!
I know, right?  "Who is the Coon?" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.
What is this? Halt!  It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me!
No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off. 
Well I'll tell you somethin'! Being from a low-income household isn't funny! Oh heell no, my momma's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam! 
No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, "Come Sail Away", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it.
Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here?  Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle?
Alright Stan, just sit down at the computer.Â 
They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!
What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!
Noo, let's save the "girlfriend is a whore" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.
Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!
How do I reach these keeds?  The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time.  This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top.
HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW! 
Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket!
You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?!  This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home! 
I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday Bunduru!Â Â Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny's backstabbing game.Â 
Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times.
Man, that new version must have sucked balls.
Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?
Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.
Come on, man, this isn't funny!  I need my fix! 
Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me! 
What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!
Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it.
Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!
Wow, that's cool. I can help you get ready. 
Stan, why don't you just ask the question?
Just keep stalling, Butters. We don't have the dead pig quite ready yet. 
All right. Guys, we need to talk.  You know, uh we can all just pretend... that we didn't see those opening ceremonies but, the Chinese... are very real. We've gotta do something.  Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?
Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle.
Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth!  Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse,  and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one,  think again. 
There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid.
Yeah, he called me a pussy! I'm not a pussy, you're a pussy!
Kenny! Kenny, wake up!  Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny!
That's not the way this country works, Kyle.  Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter.  It's the law.
You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease.
Wait a minute! You guys did make me ride that bull!
Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!
I'm not fat, I have a different life choice.
Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere. 
That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.
I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.
What are we doing out here, you guys? I wanna see if Jakov wins that game show.
Stinky britches, you got stinky britchesStinky, stinky britches, you got stinky--
We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either.  I haven't even gotten my pubes yet.
Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! That's an obvious suck-up move.
No, Fonics Monkey!  No, Fonics Monkey, that's a bad Fonics Monkey! 
Yes, that was it. I was suh-so upset.  I couldn't concentrate the rest of the day. And the way his eyes kept looking at me, slowly going up and down my body, like he was undressing me with his eyes. 
Well we can just make them out of paper.
Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it!
Weh hunh hrhrh hrh huh-right! Like I'm some hippie Indian.  You know what I'm sayin' G? Check you later-I'm gonna go chill with mide-my dad. 
You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it?  Hello?
Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who!  It was Kenny, wasn't it?
Uncle Stinky, can you drive us to the mall?
Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymarethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas.  God dammit! 
Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody.
You're very welcome, Polly Prissy Pants.  Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?
Turn around so I can clean out your ass.
Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!
That does it! I'm calling my mom right now, and bustin' your ass! 
Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. "Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one."
...Oh, okay, you figured me out.  Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble.
Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!
No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here!  We're on our way, buddy.  Magic Johnson, here we come.
Monday she's a bitch, 
on Tuesday she's a bitch, 
on Wednesday to Saturday she's a bitch
Then on Sunday, just to be different, 
she's a super King Kamehameha bi-atch!
Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan!  All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in?
Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now!
You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up.
Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!
Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home!  Okay, I'm getting pissed now!  God!
This is hopeless. How am I supposed to shoot Token with all these stupid rules?!  Wait a minute. I can't shoot Token,  but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida?
Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?
Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?
Oh shit!Â Â Butters! Butters, where are you now?
Is nice to the homeless
Californiania
Supercool to the homeless
They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train.
Yeah, but not if you guys have one, too! Now it's worthless and gay! God-damnit I'll never try to be nice again! 
This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend. 
Oh. Um, uh... Kenny?Â Â Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it. Huh, Kenny?
She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.
Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube.
We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come! 
People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.
Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that? 
Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?
You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!
And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?
You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them!
Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it.
Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia.
Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.
I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about.
I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame.
I'm talkin' Night-Court-in-it's-fifth-season lame-aaaahh!
Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often.
I'm sure this is exactly how Kurt Cobain would want to be remembered.
I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces...  ...screw you Kyle.  Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny. 
You're God-damn right I have a problem! Terrance and Phillip is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?!
We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh! 
No no, these guys were just leaving.  weren't you guys?
No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes.
Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!
I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be.
I don't give a crap 'bout whales so go and hug a tree.
Oh my God. Token, aren't you stoked?  Aww, that's awesome, Token. I'm happy for you.
Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat?
Oh well, back to the poor country with you.
Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people,  and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news.  You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends.
Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you!Â 
A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here
Wu-we don't really "need" the ticket stub, do we?
Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?
I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot. 
It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?
Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?! 
Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate!
Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes.
Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!
No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle!
I'm serious now!  Look. Over by those bushes.
Check out this sweet move.  Kyle, you can't block like that.
It didn't work, Mom! I infiltrated the NSA, and I was a whistleblower and I thought everyone would be super-pissed off at what exposed about the government, but nobody cared! Nobody cares if the government is listening in on everything! Nobody cares if Santa Claus is hooked up to a big horrible machiiiine!
What? I didn't do it, Kelly Nelson's a liar!
Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom!Â Â Mom?Â Â Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit.Â 
Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!
No no! I'm buying it to keep people out!  Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks.  But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds,  The rides are great, but...  All the lines, lines, LINES!  If there's one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!!  And then there get to be so many people  that they make FastPass.  So then there's lines for FastPass.  You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it.
Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap!
She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes.
Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff.
Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.
Get online. I need you to check something for me.
Fruttar sheshar.  What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck!  There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there!  Do you see them?
Now, leave me alone, don't do-  that, dugh  God-fucking-damnit!!! 
Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on.  Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? 
These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard.
Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom.
Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle?
So you all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell!
Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?!
Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.
But they say I can't be in their club!!
I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!
I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible.
No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!
Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible.
You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam.Â 
Hahaha, now say "Caroline, don't go into the light!"
Oh heeell NO you didn't just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST STRAW, Kyle!Â Â Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an NSA agent right here at our school
Hey Token. ...Sup bro? ...How's it goin' dude? I know how it feels now.
Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man!
God, I hate you, Kenny.  I have to get another knife; this one's hella dull! 
Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny.  Will you join me?
And another thing: it says that Mr. Hankey is also appearing at the Crossroads Mall!
All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick.
I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it.
Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!
There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!
You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!
What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die!
Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer.  Now let's see... The setup could be... "Do you like fishsticks?"
Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come!  Hey! Where is it!
Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over!
That's four hundred for us! We did it! 
"Rise above it!" Get it? Like he can rise above anything! 
That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular "Magic: The Gathering" look like girls volleyball.
You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son.  You just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules. I won't let you dominate my life anymore!  Goodbye, Mother. 
Where the hell is everybody?! I'm gonna be on TV tonight. You guys better not miss it!
Mom.can you go make me a toaster pastry chocolate-mix butter ball? 
Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!
I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!
The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on! 
Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another.
It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?
You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die...  This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.
Yeah. We'll start right away.  We'll have to do it without him.
Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass!  Oh God, help me you guys!
I must say I agree. If this copy of The Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands.
How much further is it to Grandma's house? I wanna see what kind of present she got me.
Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.
Uh oh, it looks like Kyle is taking issue with something again.Â Kyle's got a pro-blem. CartmanBrah!
You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?!Â 
My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean.
Papa Smurf was displeased at first,  He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland.
Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers.  If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands.
Alright, fine! Well then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. But we want you to know that its been really fun. Here's a watch, and some peanuts. 
I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!
Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me!  Now hand it over!
It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!  I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- 
You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on!  Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan prediction from coming true, buddy?
If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, "Hey, you go do my laundry and-"
Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish.
There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training!Â 
Yes, we know, Ms. Broflovski. It's so very interesting.
You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device.
Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed it to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well.  For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger!  Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia!  It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners.
Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter
Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual?
I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me.
Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!
You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.
'"I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink."' 
I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.
God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!
Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?
Don't give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy!  Oh wow, this is nice in here. The girls bathroom is a lot cleaner than the boys. 
Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image!  Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device.
Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna be a great day. Great day tomorrow...  Tomorrow...  "Kyle, you were wrong! We did do a record deal!"  "You were wrong, Kyle!"  "Nananananaaana!"  "Hahahahahaaaha!"  "Nananananaaana!" "Hahahahahaaaha!"  Awesommme. Yeeessss.
Ah! Eh. Nuh!  Less than a minute! Less than a minute!
How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?
And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up!  Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad.  What the hell is going on?
Looks like we're in the school now. Check out Wendy, she's flat as a pancake.
...Token. Do you want me to pass her a jelly bean?
Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it.
No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote those sodomies in France.
Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are! 
God damnit, Mom, I wasn't pickin' it! I have an itch!
Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over.
Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!
Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass! 
I'm up to 94, thank you very much.
No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television.
Gentlemen, we can win this battle!  Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, "We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, "Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!" 
Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.
We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. 
Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?! 
Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy.
Well, come on! I don't have much time! 
Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!
Oh okay, that could be a while.Â Â All our men are ready. When the mall opens, blow the whistle. We'll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit.
Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom.
You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes.
What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play!
Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard?
That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since.
Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis?
You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!
Butters is such a butthole, oh my God!Â CartmaaanBrah!
Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright?
Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies.  Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic?
Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!
I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.
Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.
My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!
Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl 
Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!
Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.
Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!
Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon.
Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.
Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe!  The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop!
Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a-  Huh?! 
Juvi Hall!  Stan's a loser! Stan's a loser! 
So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler.
He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left. 
Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!
Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.
NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die. 
And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this!
Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!
What-evah! I ran for Congress and won. Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hid her body! What-evah, I'll do what I waunt!
Well, he is not listening to my authoritah!
Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was?  God.  He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever.
Dude, come on! We've gotta get out of here! 
Heh, heh, that's a, that's, that's a little joke. Heh, heh.
Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.
Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.
Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the man?
Stan... beaver dam!  Very large beaver dam, Stan!! 
Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation.  This sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation." 
You mean, we make something that looks like a dead body?
Boner balls. Boner balls-boner... Boner forest. Dense... boner forest.
You're sterile, is that it?  No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it?  Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless.
I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart.  You're right Kyle. I'm fat.  All these years you tell me and me saying "No, I'm big-boned" or "no, that's just muscle"... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.
No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!
Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race,  then I need those cigarettes.
Well, where is it?  What the hell is that?!
I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry!  What the hell?!
Yes, right here. I went to Amazon to see if they had Grand Theft Auto V, and it says, "you might also be interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek." I'm totally interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek! How did they know that unless the government is keepin' tabs on mw?!Â Â This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to go hard core!
Who's we? You got a turd in your pocket? Hahahaha.
Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town.
Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah.  We here this a million times back up in the States.
I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.
Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott.Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride!
Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.
There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future!
We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!
Hey guys. Good morning.  You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon.
Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?
...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too.
Yeah, I'm just hangin' out with Token. Did you know that if it wasn't for African-Americans, we wouldn't have Rock & Roll? So cool that we have a black President.  About time. 
Oh, I think I see where this is going. 
O! At least I have as ass, Jew!
Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.
Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.
Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store! 
You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson.
Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint green from its surface.
You're doing unnatural things in the house of God!
