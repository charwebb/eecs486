Alright Token, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve? I've got a way better idea.  First bump?  Come on dude, fist bump. Bump that shit bro. Be the bigger person. 

I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town.  At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.  Then I saw this...  Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... . hippie music festival.

Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass. 

Aw aw guys, come on!

Alright Butters, sit down at the computer.  Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it!

You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight! 

My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers.

Yeah! 

No Starvin' Marvin, that's my pot-pie.

Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.

Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all.  And get some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass!

I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!

'Sup, Jew?

Uhh trust me, he's not fat and unimportant. I think we need to change his status to "ripped and sweet."  'Scuse me. Excuse me! There's a very important threat to national security! We need to change Eric Cartman's status!

Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding.

Where is it? Where is it?!

Oh no you don't! 

I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.

I'm sure it was just a mistake.

Aagh! God-dammit!

Nuh uh.

So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb. 

Why does Grandma have to live so far away? Why don't we just stick her in a nursing home closer to us so  I don't have to drive six hours to get a god-damned present?!

I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction. 

Yeah, I can’t get this stupid song out of my head.

Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured.  Ah sick!  Gross!  Yeck!  Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike...  vampires.

His dad sees you!

Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it!  Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! 

What?

Uh, can we see them-him-her?

Man, Vietnam was sweet!

Fine, then let go of my hand!

This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act!

What if you don't have any rhythm?

Nothin' to do now but wait.

The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right?

I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do?

All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -

Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?

What does that have to do with me?

Yes! We're good!

Totally fuckin' stupid, dude!

It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now.

...What?

Hey guys, have you been takin' your Ritalin?

From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token. You just do all the singing, all the performing and all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us.

Yes, I have it right hmya. 

Why??

Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.

Oh yeah, you're right.  Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don't want all that, why don't you share it with me, man?  Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here...

Huho!

Yeah, and you're a towel!

...Fuck! Dude, weak. 

Uh oh.

We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.

Ting ton teetong.

I'm trying to get my tri- wait a minute, I'm not talking to you. Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was trying to get my triangle back?

All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30.  We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory!

Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!

Kelly Rutherfordmenskin.

Cool.

Whoa, whoa, watch it lady.

Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger.

Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!

Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch!  You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness.

No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!

Why does that matter?

What the hell?!

(Hey! Come over here!)

Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems.

Haha. Oh man, that was great. Okay, go ahead. I'm all out of farts now.  Gahaaa! Derrr!

Uh, yes?

No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... puts a penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!

Ah.  Uh.  Yeeeesss!

Well what do I sit on?

But the other jakovasaur talked different.

We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding!

...I don't have a dad.

Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip Scissors.

Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?

Let's be partners, Kenny.

What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?

Oh hey, Kenny.

Okay. 

Theee conference room is which way? 

Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?

Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg.

We'd like to get XBox Ones please.

Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle... Happy Passover!

Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... 

Oh! Aww!  Oh, weak! 

No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?

Good for you. 

Jesus Christ. 

Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.

We had a DEAL KYLE!

Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble!  No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money!  Oh God, what am I doing?  I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke!  Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble.

We're fine, thanks.

I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage.  This has to be stopped, you guys.

Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!!  Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh.  Just- okay  No.  Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh. 

Yeah, this is sweet!

You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out. 

There, you see? My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!  What, Red?! You're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?! I don't care!  Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea!

I'm not doin' it for Kyle.  I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. 

Kyyyle!

Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That's my cell phone.  Hello? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is.

Got it. 

Dude, when my mom finds out that my babysitters have their boyfriends over, she mostly gets really mad, mostly.  Yaaah. Eeyy! Ey, God damnit!

Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! 

Bark bark bark.  Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket  and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants. 

Kenny. Can't have Kenny.

Crap! 

Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.

Who the hell are you?

You slept with my girlfriend, Hammerclaw! 

Jesus!

Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!

Thanks Jody! Gingers, how are we feelin'?  Can I get a Red Power?

Cartman, God damn it.

Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow.

Who cares?

Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?

Hey gay-butts, what's goin' on?

Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches. 

Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.

You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die...  This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.

I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.

Are you fucking serious? 

They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.

Dude, Kyle. Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are.  Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive.  Kyle?

Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know.

Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?

That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!

No Mom, you don't understand! I've been waiting for this thing to come out for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It's like... waiting for Christmas... times a thousand.

Jews..

No! Hold on a second!  I have a contract  validated by the United States court system!

"To Douglas." There you go.  Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy.

Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.

Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now?  Kyle, where are you going?

Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat!

Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.

Billy Miller? Seriously??

Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. 

Heh, heh, that's a, that's, that's a little joke. Heh, heh.

Yeah, HEY!

Stan, if you're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd like to go now, please?

We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.

Still balls.

Why, that's PERfect!

Slowly the rage built inside his mind.  "Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!" His only solution became obvious: Kill her!

Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you.

Aw man, this is awesome! 

Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.

That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face!

What did you call us?!

Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you!  Iya!

How about this one, Kenny? 

Alright, Scott, you win. I give up.

Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry.

Then let's move out! 

Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home!  Okay, I'm getting pissed now!  God!

Come on, let's go!

...Not really.

Hey Chef.

Dude, that's sick mom.

Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!

Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!  Kiss my balls, asshole!!!  Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.

Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature,  excluding Stan and Kyle, of course.

All right, now you can try to send this Bozo through and the whole mess'll be over with!

What day is American invasion again? I fohget. 

Nice.

Nono, Jeh-

Ohhh awesome!!! 

Let me see! 

Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.

Well, somebody did!

Them who?!

Yeah, granola pisses me off. 

This is ridiculous!

God, it's so hard to find good help.  Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?

I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right?  The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle. You are a race of beady-eyed thieves who are always wan- 

U-u-huh. I don't remember.

Colonel, how are you doing?

Oh cool! I got a racing game for Xbox!  D'you guys see that? Coool, huh?

But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?

Better red than dead!

Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass.

Go look for yourselves!!

Oh weak!

I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost!

Okay, here's your ticket  and they're gonna have a car waiting for you at the gate in New York. 

S'aright.

Look, I have to have one of those phones!

Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh.  Ogh! Wait-

Isn't he awesome, you guys?

Nice work, Conner.

No! No es bueno! 

Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough.

Thank you, Kyle.

Yes! She stole my triangle!

You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say.

That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there  if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.

I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo.

Kick ass.

Kenny! I'm-

Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!

Looks like you're about to get pwned.  Heeyeah! 

That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle? 

Aw, man, this movie is hella scary. 

Hey you guys! How's it goin'?

You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!

Oh crap! There's more of them! 

Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now?  Ugh--!

Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?

Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?

I don't remember.

Damn!

The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.

Ha-heheheh.  That was Kenny laughing, not me.

Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas!

What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.

Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore.

Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken.

Cartman. Eric T. Cartman.

I don't smell anything. Do you guys? 

Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.

Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him?

No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote those sodomies in France.

Yes.

Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody!  Where the hell is Timmy?

I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!!

Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.

How do you know??

Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson.

Yes!! Yes, I DID IT!! I crapped out my mouth!  I crapped out my mo-outh!  You owe me twenty bucks, dickface!

Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!

Ih... in our... butt?

Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person.

Yeah. I guess so.

I agree. Those places are stupid.

You're God-damn right I have a problem! Terrance and Phillip is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?!

And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process.

I know, huh?

I told you guys! "Washington Redskins" totally gets people's attention!

Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew.

Ewww-hoohooo.

What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles?  Am I to understand there will be no side dishes?

Help! 

Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?

...bitch.

I think we're almost to the end.

Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!

Oh wow, where are we now, brahs?  This looks pretty stupid.

He-yeah, that's what Kyle's little brother is all right!  Ow! 

No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves.

Kyle, are you sure?

Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.

I told you guys.

Oh yeah, that one's cool.  Yeah, this part's killer. 

Don't worry. I have a plan. 

So?

For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.

Calm down! Calm down! We can have special effects, too. Now, I know a lot is going wrong, but we've got to stick together to make this play work!  All of us! 

Hello, Precious. Yes, that's a good Precious.  Now it takes the lotion from the basket.

Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?

Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did.

Ey!

All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain!

And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this!

Oh that's good that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle.  Yeah, nice.

But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!

Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!

Come on. 

I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song!

It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!

Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.

Huh? 

Oh yeah, let's see. Hey, Sylvester. 

Hello Jim.

Grandmagrandmagrandmagrandma! 

What kind of video did you guys make?

You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!

Haha, charade you are, Scott! 

Come on! Let's kill it! 

What's a multiplication table?

What are you, Clyde? A gay fish?

Grrr. Jesus Christ I can't go on like this.  Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?

Keep... your hand... UP!

Mister Hammerhead?

You son of a bitch cat!

God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars.

Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg?

Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.

Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you! 

Sweet. 

Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.

And...
''O Holy Night, the stars are brightly shi-ning
It is the night of our dear Savior's b-b-b-birth
O Holy Night, the- something, something, dis-- aah.
It is the night with the Christmas trees and pie.
Jesus was born, and so I get presents.
Thank you, Jesus, for being born. (Wo-o-o-o-o)
Fall (Fall)

Oh. Ah. Ch.

What?

Sittin' on our asses, here we come!

Is he awake yet?

Oh shit!  Butters! Butters, where are you now?

No! ...No!

What? Let me see that. 

The hall monit- me?

Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry. 

Thank God we stopped it in time.

What do they want?

Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!

I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.

Why?

You wanna take it out for a spin?

All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'.

The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!

Up yours, Butters.

But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything!

I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?

I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo.

Whatever. That's like five years from now.

I'm committed to peace, Wendy.  I want you to see just how humbled I am... 

Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit!

Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed.

He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid.  Haha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican!

Aw dude, I hate repeats!

Right.

Ms. Jessica Parker, over here. 

Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!

Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true.  Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! 

…Touché. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, just… tell me what to do, and I'll do it.  Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih.  Wendih. Seriouslih.  The Bog Monster speaketh.

Goddammit, I am not a dog!  Give me the chicken. Give, give, give me the chicken. I want the chicken! Chicken!  Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken!

That's not what I said! 

I got some badass guys to help me.
I only had to pay them fifteen bucks.
You think you got away with not having a hall pass?
You won't get away from me 'cause I'm the Dawg!
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
Think you can get away with not having a hall pass? Think again!  How was that, Butters?

It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.

Sure.

Whoa, bummer, dude.

Because, dude, it's all over Eavesdropper!

Ey Kenny! God-damn you, Kenny!

"Ooh, I don't wanna dig up my dead grandma 'cause I'm such a goody-two-shoes!"  Ow.

Yeah, well, at least  it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease.

It's a strong name, dude. It's like agressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken.

For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person!  This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!

Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!

For Show and Tell today I have brought...  ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!..  behind the 9/11 attacks! 

Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit!

Kenny!

No, we're fine! Thank you!

Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over!

That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since.

Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again!

I don't believe you.

Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.

How much is it?

I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why , we're gonna transform into something.

What?

Oh, it's on, bitch!

What is it, Chef?

Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come? 

Including the late and very talented Billy Mays!

Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! 

Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox. 

You... have that kind of power?

Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like  bitch! 

You're welcome, Scott. 

Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!

Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps?

Yeah. Who isn't?

Who's in there?

...What?

Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?

Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth.  Hm?

Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride!

Yeah, cartoons kick ass! 

Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?

Yeah. Yeah, of course. Let me get my coat. 

I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!

Wha-uh, what?? What?

Well, I just, I kind of like having you around.

Navigation systems?

Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important.

Locked and loaded. Full metal bush, bro.

The outbreak's starting! Fly the plane now! 

I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.

The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface.

Everyone quiet! I have to think!

Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!

Laugh all you want, I'm the one who's gonna be on TV, looking all buff. 

I'll shit in your fuckin' garden!

Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers? 

Better red than dead!

Whoa.

She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.

We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.  There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone!  Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!

I see the questions in your eyes.
I know what's weighing on your mind.
You can be sure I know, my heart.
Girl I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear (I swear) like a shadow that's by your side (Keep it down, girl)
I'll be there
For better or worse (better or worse), till death do us part (death do us part)
I'll love you with every black beat of my heart
And I swear. I swear. I s-we-e-e-ear Yeah, I swear. Straight up. What it do?

Maybe... No.

You might as well go buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked! Do you wanna fuck me Mom?!  Just say so! Go ahead! Here!  Huh?! Go ahead, Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me right here in the Best Buy! You wanna fuck your son so bad?! Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me!

Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you.

Fine.

I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot. 

Mom, this guy doesn't-

Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.

Oh yeah, I guess that doesn't make sense. 

Oh, good. In The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, a bunch of uh, hippies, walk around and paint stuff. They eat lunch, and then they find a magical... camel... which they have to eat to stay alive. And that's pretty much it; I give it a B-minus.

Heh! Yeah, right! You guys could kiss my black ass!

He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at!  Bah!

So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!

Oh for the love of Christ.  I wanna watch, fat boy!  No, Kenny, it's not funny!

Man, that new version must have sucked balls.

You guys! You guys! You guys! 

Was I alarmed?  Yes.  I believe I was.

Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up!

Oh, pretty good, except I had the weirdest dream last night.

Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!

Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!

Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off? 

Somaliaaan piiiraaates weeeeee.

Where is the detonator?!

What kind of cookies?

Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.

Boyongture taur lur mahrter.

There will be refreshments served! So make sure your mom goes to the grocery store, Kevinnn! So come one, come all! The invitation is open to any student who wants to be a pirate, and who isn't Jewish, Mexican or ginger! Arrrgh!

It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities!

Were is Timmy?! He's on in one minute!

Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle.

Oh hey Butters. Sup?

Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it!

Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again.

Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing!

Butters is such a butthole, oh my God! CartmaaanBrah!

Thank you, High Elf of Paragon.

Yes! Yes! I'm a star! I'm a star! I'm--  Aaawww, I'm nobody! God-damnit!  Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign from God. That's it, isn't it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million dollars, don't you? That's it! 

I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car. 

Butters. 

I am not going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters!

What? What?

The smug?

Kyle no, seriously.  No fuckin' elephant is going to make love to my Fluffy, I…Kyle, I will kick you in the nnnnuts.

Well, think about it.  The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by.

Eh yeah?

No no! I'm buying it to keep people out!  Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks.  But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds,  The rides are great, but...  All the lines, lines, LINES!  If there's one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!!  And then there get to be so many people  that they make FastPass.  So then there's lines for FastPass.  You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it.

Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?

Eechh! Screw you, hippie! Eeeh-eh.

I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are.  Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that.

Jennifer Lopez?

Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh.  There we go. 

So what are you saying, Kyle?!

Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?

That'd be what?

Guys, tell him you're not computer programs.

Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble!

Why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom?!

Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!

Oh, hey, What's goin' on? I'm uh, here for the party.

Aw, Mom!

No way!

But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right?

So you'll join the American Liberation Front?!

There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid.

Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip! 

Nothin', it's cool.

You will? Oh, cool!

Yeheah, we're wired up!

Oh my God...

No, dude, you gotta try it.  It makes you feel good.

What the? ...Oh, Token's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable.

Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude. 

Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!

No, no! Craig, you you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today.

Dude, we've created a monster.

Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year.

I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down! 

What?? Ih- is she okay?

Dude, I couldn't take anymore of that balloon. Another couple hours of that, and I would've been totally pissed off.

Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients!

More calamine lotion!

I can't let you do that!

Whattayou mean?

We know, we were just saying that.

Alright, I think it's in. 

Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear?

Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall.  So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it--

Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!

Yes. The fireman is very magical. If you rub his helmet, he spits in your eye. 

Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month.

Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey. 

Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass. 

Oh. My. Goodddd.

God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!

Screw this Conner.  Find yourself another partner.

Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million dollars. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean,  I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know? 

No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui!

Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.

What? Why?

Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day!

Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!

Very well, Kenny! Let us battle!  Ow, Kenny. K-Kenny! Knock it off.

And panda bears for the preschoolers.

That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. 

Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad.

It's all CartmanBrah now.  I am trending into something more than human. I am becoming... transgender.  Now they will HAVE to give my my own bathroom!

Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him. 

Yes! That's three homeless! Suck on that! Fuck yeah! 

Dude, that mom is kewl. 

Wendy. Wendy psst.

I can't believe I got sent to the principal's office because of your stupid girlfriend!

A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?

Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food.

No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu!

Where the hell is everybody? 

I dunno.

Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend. 

Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo!

Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!

Tell them I'll be down shortly

You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me.

Heellp! 

Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player!

Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!

Uh, hey Jenny. Sup?

This is... bullcrap! If I'm thin- I'm gonna be so... pissed off!  Goddammit! 

Heheh, guess who I am, guys?

Uh excuse me, excuse me everyone I, I guess you might have noticed my awkward tics. Asshole! Pussy asshole!  Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it.

Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril.  Come on, ninjas!

Cool.

Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us.

Ha!! Fags! 

Eey! Freline furton! Sucky-sucky!

Are you serious? How can there be-  Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers??

Let a man take a crap!

Haahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us! 

Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! 

Did you check the shopping ma-  Ow!

I had to stay home because my mother wasn't feeling well. She has the flu, and I wanted to take care of the house so she could stay in bed.  I just wanted to catch you guys to see if we were assigned any homework tonight.

Drive the car damn-it, drive!

That's right, I did!You guys are hella stupidYou guys are hella lameYou guys are hella dumbHella hella hella!

I know. I know Kyle. 

Kyle! Fire spell!

Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture?

Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.

Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth.

Welcome back, dude.

So what happens when the dragons show up?

Is this cool or not? I can't tell.

No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us.

Give me that phone number!

Mel! Gibson!  Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer! You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding!  Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?!

God these guys are so annoying, aren't they? CartmaaanBrah!

I'm gonna get those killer sai.  Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken  for a dollar ninety nine.

And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny.

Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.

Aw, shut up, you freakin' hippies!  Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, amd you must refer to me as "Captain."

Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!

He's right in here.

Guys, meeting over here for a second?  All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard.

Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. Faggot! 

Oh, cool. Please take a seat.

Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a  Sega Dreamcast.

Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want.

Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-in', ring ting tingle-in' too Outside it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, and you, and you.

Somebody get us some help down hyah!

He's fuckin' gay as hell!

Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?!  Oh crap! 

Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume. 

AH! 

Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.

That's Captain Cartman, you Jewswoggle!

Good-bye Mr. Hankey!  Bring me lots of presents!  I always believed in you!

No! God damn it no!  Who's takin' a shit?!

Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!

Big surprise!

You guys, eh seriously, my back!

You know, Stan, I'd say your dad racksa disciprine!

Hehey, no no! We aren't the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam, okay?! That's their fault!

Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.

Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! 

You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?

I'm sorry, Mom.

Mom, seriously! 

Okay, I'll make it easy for you.  Pull the Mohammad episode, now!

Oh God.

All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  Jesus Christ!  One please.

Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale.

Screw you, hippie!

Come on, guys! This is the cure de gars of Butters' torture!

God, I hate you guys!

I do, I love my country!

Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me!  I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!

That's right.

Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike.

Heh-tchoo!

Fine!

Hi Wendy.

Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?

Eeehhh.

Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this.  Especially one who doesn't trust me. 

Gee, thanks Kyle!

Okay.

No! NOOO!

How the hell are condoms gonna help us?!  Sorry, heh. Never mind, hehe. 

Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team.  And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters. 

All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in!

This thing is recording, right?

Eh! 

Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle.

Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh.

I I said "thank you." Thank you for listening. 

Yes!

Oh, awesome! 

They loved it! They LOVED it!

Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe!  The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop!

Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me.

What?!

All right, this one I can win!  Here, hold this!  I'll show you Goddamned retards! 

Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000.

Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good?

Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.

It's true.

I told you I'm serious, Butters.  This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can.

Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay?

Yeah.

Nobody's fuckin' screaming, Craig! Wake the fuck up! 

Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.

Oh sure!

Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-

Nooo!

Der yourself, hippie!

Seems a little convenient, doesn't it?  Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.

It's not gonna be okay because now I'm a whistleblower, and against my conscience I'm gonna have to hide out in Russiaaaa! 

I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers and you don't.

Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please?  Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions.

What the hell is this?!

Yeah, I think the same thing.

What?

It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now!

Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV? 

Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls?

Yes! We've had a new time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck  Au revoir, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen? 

I would if I could, you son of a bitch!

You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out?

You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can prove you had a boyfriend over heuh!

"Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure."  Fuck you Milly, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch! 

Uh, what else?  Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh! 

Stan's getting another present, Mom.

Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.

...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism.

See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.

That's Kenny with branches on his head.  Why did you bring me all the out here, you guys?

Just keep stalling, Butters. We don't have the dead pig quite ready yet. 

My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.

I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?

Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us.

Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!

that's why they're lame.

Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is...

Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity.

You'd better get us out of here, asshole!

Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. 

I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!

This is the reason why our living rooms are dying, so we've got to do something.

It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!

Sure. 
Here's a little dreidel that's small and made of clay.
But I'm not gonna play with it, 'cause dreidel's freakin' gay.

I love you guys.  Ah, screw you guys(!)

Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!

Thank you.

You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?

Will he bleed? That's all we care about.

Terrible!  I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me.

We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. 

Come on, you guys, it's getting cold up here!

Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!

Run Chef!

No, but you got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it.

Alright, alright.  Kyle...

Liane Cartman.

Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate!

Lumpy potatoes?! Oh, no!

What?!

What?!

Eeyy!

It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC. 

No, Kitty! 

Don't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me!  They didn't take my Stormtrooper watch...  My Arkham City game is still here... what else could they have-   Oh my God.  Clyde Frog!

Kevin, Jesus Christ!  Hard to starboard, lads! There's sure to be lots of booties out hyah!  Clyde, the fuck?!

We have to hurry!

Oh well, back to the poor country with you.

Thanks for your help! Visit us again!

You can't possible mean...?

These commercials are all so God-damn stupid!

Okay, all set!

Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter.

Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?

Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve.  But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear.

You bet your fat clown ass it is!

"The next zipline? What are you talking about?"

No way!

Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout.

In the ...hospital? Why?

Well that's fine! You can't call yourself "Washington Redskins!"

Eh but, but this doesn't make sense to me, Marty! Okay, you told me the movie made a lot of money!

Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!

Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.

Kyle, this is a private conversation.

Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one. 

Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?

Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.

Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick.

Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!

And now this next picture 

Something he said. Did you hear him? He said "Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!"

How could you be so stupid!

Yes! I really did.

I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!

What? Well, that does sound pretty good.  Uh, Mom?

Shoveling accident.

Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know.

FELLAS! Fellas!

I do toooo!

Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother.

Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh!

Out of the way. Out of the way please. 

I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top. 

There he is, there's my buddy.

We have a deal, Blavius. As long as I get what I want, you have nothin' to worry abuot. 

What's the Gomlich effect?

I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?

Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay? It's not expensive.

She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked.  You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom.

Jesus, ix-nay on the ool-schay.

Okay, mom.

Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game.

Oh I hate this stupid Christmas poo.  Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas to you!

Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this??

Kyle?

You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.   Why look, it's me. And...  And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? 

C'mon, Kenny. Let me ha--

But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right? 

Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home.

Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand!

That's right, Butters.

Then start explaining it to me!

Oooaaagh.

Oh, you've gotta be kidding' me!

My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine.

Du-dude! You're doing it all wrong! Let me handle this.  Alright ya scalliwags! Surrender your plunder and let me send my shot across your bow!

Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week.

Yeah, And cry.  Oh, he's ready.

Oh my CHRIST!  Kyle? Kyle!

OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW!

Woohoo.

It's all right! There's been a misunderstanding! I'm a hall monitor.  This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway infraction by skipping off to Milan.

What?

A-heh, what?

What?

And he never took Communion!

Oh! Well, you know what I say?!  Screw you guys, I'm going home! 

Alright everybody, let's take our places!

A dark wizard must be trying to stop us!

Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits!

Dude, can I go before you?

Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?  God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like "I touched penises with my cousin!"  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle.

Token forfeits!  Whites win!  Whites win!  Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!

...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore. 

If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?

Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!

Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?

I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God.  He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously.

Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is the like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met.

No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Token was able to do all that is because his family is rich!

That's fine, just get it out of the way...

Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them.

I hate you guys!

All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with "Wow, how insightful."

They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again.

Huh?  Oh, no, you sons of bitches! Aww, sons of bitches..! 

Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might by a...  Pakistani.

The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!

Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, hun?! No! Not this time!  The school has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you!  You remember the school physical we all took last week?!

Hello, is this the Maury Povich show?  Yes, I'm calling because I saw your television program, and I also have balls hanging from my chin.  I'd like to come in and talk about my disorder and perhaps get a free trip to the largest putt-putt golf course in the world?

And where... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey?

NOOOO!

I am not gonna be bossed around by a chick!  Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over.

This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public. We can say we gave our "student athletes" a place to live and grow for a few years. It's like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! Great work! 

Ma? I just dreamt that me and Stan and Kyle and Kenny were trapped on our bus, and we were talking about everything that happened to us, except that it was all wrong and everything ended with us eating ice cream.

Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!

No!

It is wrong for me to ask questions?Is it wrong to seek the truth?I just can't blindly accept their version.I can't base my logic on proof.Almost all the evidence points one way,But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:I need to know what really happenedOn 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.What really happenedOn 9/11?Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?

Hold the gun on them Butters!

Alright you guys, let's bring it in.  I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay?

Hm.

Ugh!

Hunh.  Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA.

Fat camp?

I'll make you eat your parents!

Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. 

Boooriing. 

Alright cool, guys, gather all around. Everyone should be a witness to this.  Alright, you ready? Now say "I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me." Come on, dude, "I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me." 

Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!

Hell no, you guys get your own!

The Jews!

I-I'll try. I'll try. 

What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight.

Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!

All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages.

Let's put our hands up, everyone! 'Cept for Jacob. His mom's so poor she only understands hand-OUTS. 

My mom made it, isn't it cool?

Nno!

Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon!

There are too many minorities (too many)
At my water park (somebody do something).
Where did they all come from?
Why can’t they leave this land alone?
And it’s such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying).
We looked the other way too long.
We’ve got to change our priorities
And get all these minorities
Out of my water park
(Minorities) Mexicans and Asians,
(Black people), I think I even saw a Native American (gross).
God I’m asking please, get all of these minorities
Out of my water park (my water park).

I'm not fat! I'm getting in shape!

Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us "genetically inferior." The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are!

Okayokay, fine. Wow me.

Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.

Heh, okay, okay.  You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead.  Dead??

You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this!

And our love grows

...I don't understand the difference.

Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules.

Dude...

Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2!  When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur,  but when I computer-enhanced it,  You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.

You're goin' down, bitch!  Nobody takes my ratings!

Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?

Goddamnit, get me down from here! 

Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.

Um, could I get you to do something for me?

Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard.

Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock knock, Kyle!

Yeah.

Hey!

Mom? Where's my mom?

What?!

I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these. 

You heard what?

They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.

Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns  and 800 points. 

That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!

...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick!  God damn it!

Hello? ...BHI records? ...Oh, it's for you, Ms. Lopez. 

Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?

Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!

If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, "Hey, you go do my laundry and-"

No! Noooo!  Casa Bonita! Noooo!  AAAAH!!  Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!

You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?! 

Oh, so now everybody wants to meet Mr. Hankey! He's a piece of crap.

Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!

Aw, damnit!  Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes! 

Hey Kyle. What's up?

Aw, crap!

That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason.

Mmmm! Tastes like chicken. The ass of a chicken!

"Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!"

Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.

Well, I'm a badass cowboy living in a cowboy's
Age wicky wicky scratch yo yo bang bang
Me and Artemus Clyde Frog go save
Salma Hayek from the big metal spider
Wicky wicky wick, wicky wicky wick, Fresh
Cowboy from the Westside-

Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good.

No, Uncle Jesse, no!

Boy you like my body. Set the mood, let's play!
You can touch me anywhere except for my vajayjay.

Wow, I get it now! I get it!  Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time.

Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over!

Huh? A little bit?

I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!

Marrado. Spectacularrr.

Alright y'all, keep your eyes peeled and your guns ready.  There's a heap of Mexicans out there who want nothin' more than to sneak past our border, and we've gotta stop them!

Sweet.

Come on! The cameras are ready!  Alright, there we go. Let's roll cameras.  Oh, and here's your microphone. 

There's nothing faggy about $10 million dollars, asshole! This was a message from God!

Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. 

I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.

Oh, about a month.

Uh, Kyle?  Come on, seriously?  You are really reaching right now.

Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster.  But you're my little monster.

Welcome to our offices, Token. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm?  Come on over this way, Token.  Guys, you remember Token. He's thinking about becoming a client.

Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down!  Well it's on! We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW! 

But I wanna plaaayyy.

Hoo-ray.

You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes.

-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!

Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket.

Whatever. All I know is that I can laugh again. I'm gonna go home and eat another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny! 

Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle.  It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls.

...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities?

He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people. 

Who the hell are you?!

What's that thing?

Dude! Dude!

...You guys!... 

Well, I wanna know who my dad is, but... to find out they have to do these DNA tests, and they cost $3000 and... I don't have $3000.

Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!

I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE.

I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!

Awww, man...

Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too! 

Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.

Wiffle ball, anyone?  Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?

Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?

Oh, good. 

Let me have time with him.

Hey! Wait up, you assholes! God! 

Aaaaaaaah!

Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.

Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs.

What do you mean, Kyle?

You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart!

Californiania Idn't on the tona

Bush is a Naizi

Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me!  Oh, oh, oh. 

Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built.  Oh, man!

Blulululuh. Screw you guys.

Awww!

You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny!

Bluh! Aah! You guys! Seriously!

Just do it in English!

What? Fuck Kyle.  Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.

What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!

Yes, with every passing second I become more powerful.

I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!

Oooh, Two little hippies sit'n' in a tree...

We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: "Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!"

You wanna see 'em?

It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! 

Token, look away to the right.  More.  More!

Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna put it on the Internet or... No, wait! Kenny.  I just had the greatest idea... ever!

Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah. 

Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down.

Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed? 

No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.

But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.

Oh my God,  it smells like ass out here.

No- no such thing?

I don't know.

Boy band.

I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!

Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture.  I got my period, and you guys didn't. I got my period, and you guys didn't. 

I don't know, I just knew it.  Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?!

That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.

Oh look, another hippie.  Peace, Wendy.

Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes.  One.  Heh, two.  Come on! Uugh, come on, now! Come on, uuhhhgghh  yeahhh. Hoh. Phew.  Hoh. ...Oh, God-damnit! 

I'm grubbin'. What's it look like?

Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez.

Alright, come in.  Kenny's here; I told him all about it. 

10-4, sergeant! 

Could you turn up the heat just a little?

Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out!  The fuck?!

What?! Who?!

Oh, God. That was boring.

'Cause people think I'm cool, dude.

Well, I'm pissed off!

No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want!

Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh?

Mom, please can we just leave?

What the hell?

You don't owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean. 

Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys.

Dude! That is not cool! Choppin' off wee wees is not cool!

Everything alright here, Kyle?

I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame.
I'm talkin' Night-Court-in-it's-fifth-season lame-aaaahh!

I can do this aaall day.

They're all over the place.

This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole!  I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate people.

Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see...

Gentlemen, we can win this battle!  Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, "We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, "Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!" 

No no, wait a minute! If... if she's my dad, then... who's my mom?!

Sir, the pyramid is upside down.

I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Chee-

Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall!

Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!

Son of a bitch!

Huh?

This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.

Lame.

C'mon!

Little pussy gnome. Don't call me a pussy, pussy gnome.

Noooo! 

So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!

Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can.

I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene.

When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind.

Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes.

Yeah?  Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what I'm getting.  The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000.

It's sooo amazing!  You spin this thing on the ground and it goes 'round and 'round. I could watch it aaall day!

Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR!

Let me see! 

Heh, ho-okay. 

Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second.  Mom, there's some homeless guy here. Make him go away. 

Black people say He-ey!  Cool. White people say Ho ho! 

You piece of crap, I'll kill you! 

I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the-  What the hell's going on?

Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here.

That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look.  Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is.

Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done?

You saw that?

Oh my God, this is sooo cute.

Good-bye, Ms. Ellen.

Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.

My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!

I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once.

We take to the African sea!
We'll brave the squalls and bust your balls
Somalian pirates we!

You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina.

We're going to the water park,
The water park, the water park.
We're going to the water park,
Me and my best friends, except for Kyle who I don't like.

Suck my balls!

"It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation  to increase the population of the younger generation."

I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.

In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, in the ghetto

Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have?

Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!

But mmmooom, I'm playing Wild Wild West.

Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa!

It is?  Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! 

Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski!

Uh... now ending fart sequence.

And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we can sell your fetus to companies like Alder Labs.

Wuu, Garrison-san sabuchii dana. 

No! A piece of celery.

Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a-  Huh?! 

What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on?

Get off my car, Kenny!

I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around.

What the hell?!  Mom? Mom, my room is...  AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!

No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.

Wow!

Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin?

AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!

God, shut up, dude.

What is that butthole doing now?!

Wing? Wing?

Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!

Hey, maybe. 

No, come back! You face everlasting damnation!  Wait! No! No!  I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!

Looks like we're in the school now. Check out Wendy, she's flat as a pancake.

I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-

Weak! 

And, and big rosy cheeks! 

Nah-uh, I don't raku disciprine!

Because, Butters, Kyle was spying on us, okay-  Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video.

The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?!

Hey everybody! Listen up! I've got something to tell Kyle! 

Oh my God! Jenny Simons crapped her pants!  Did you hear that?!  It's WAY worse than Pete Melman was!

My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.

And I've got the sea men. 

It's not fair! It's not fair; I wanna die! I wanna daaahahie! 

Ah he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis.  Right guys? 

Respect my authoritah! 

Puh- pussy!

Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there.

Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right.  Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security?

I think this new guy's funny.

We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh!  If thy hand offend thee, cut it off!  It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-

God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards! Hello? 

Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go!  MOM, GET UP!

When do we get the sports watch?

Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please?  Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. 

Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?

At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!

Remember the time when Fonzie jumped over the buses with his motorcycle?

Okay. 

I'm not going out in his car.

Not the next song, the next PERSON!  Aw, man, this is gonna be a long-ass day. 

Pfaha, so funny. 

Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people.  Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm.  Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh.  Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!

Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler.

Hey, you would taste my pee!

Hey!  I'm taking my pig and…Screw you guys!  I'm going home!  This whole idea's stupid anyway.

Come on, you guys! Hurry!  Guys, hurry!

So how are things, guys?

Nice, Butters, write that down!

Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long!

Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?

Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!

I'm sure this is exactly how Kurt Cobain would want to be remembered.

Yo, Pops!

Thank you. 

Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on "Saturday Night Live"?

Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.

Wow.

Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it.

So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!

Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing.

...You are a homo, Butters.

His shield and armor spells are down!

Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a... boxer, or something.

I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you.

So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long!  Yeessss. Kyle's monneey. 

What?

Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.

I told you guys. The holiday season is nothing but lies and bullcrap!

Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins.

Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?

Whoa, cool.

Hey, yeah!  Ow!

Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumbass European hippie piece of crap. 

I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!!

Wait a minute! You guys did make me ride that bull!

I don't care. I'm supposed to sit here and do my homework.

It's sooo sweet!

Start with Kenny! Start with Kenny! 

Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy.

Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mon's cake, pie, and ice cream, then.

No way, I set up mine first, hippie!

Noooo! 

What did you call me?

Well, Butters, there is no I in "team."

Eh! 

Shh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now!

That's stupid.

You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!

Who would have thought such a miracle could be?Who could have known that this moment I would see?A new way of living, a chance to be free?

Bebe's boobs?

It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!

It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool.

Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?

That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.

Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money.  Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!

Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species.  Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine.

Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it.

Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!

I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt.  A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls!  I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!

Hey, it kind of looks like Mr. Garrison.

Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you now.

Well, screw him, he's dead! Let's go look for crocodiles! 

Who you calling stupid, Jew?

I just don't know what I'm gonna do.  Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me. 

Heh! Come on, stingray!  Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me!  Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go!

Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!

No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders!

Hey. Maybe it's our teacher, Mr. Garrison.

Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?

Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.

All right, now everyone back over there!  We'll start with what I already know. 

Me?!

Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk! 

Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!

Okay. 

Who the hell cares what it's called, as long as she doesn't have to touch me.

Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!

Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!

This is a distraction from our work on the church!  Do not think that you can tempt us with toys  and new games  and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with!  Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!

...naw, that didn't work either.

Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?

I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.

Thanks, dude. 

Kyle, are you on your computer?

Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?

Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On!

Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle.  Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character.

You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!

"SORRY"?! YOU GAVE ME AIDS AND YOU'RE "SORRY"?!

...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop. 

All right! And now I will use my power to...  turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh! 

Aw Goddamnit! 

AAAAAAAH!

My pubes.

Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay?

No you won't Butters!

HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!

Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?!

What?

Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon.

You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset.

Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.

When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.

What?!

What happens if we win the State Championship game?

Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.

Oh, come on, Kenny! You never have a sweet costume! You're not gonna win the costume contest!

Yes, he did.

It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.

Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about?

It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt.

Uh huuh.

Don't touch me! 

Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it?

And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?

Wookies don't live on Endor.

Oh dude, was that a combo move?

No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.

NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.

There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up! 

But mom, I don't want to spend time with my little friends--

Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask  and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof. 

Stan, why don't you just ask the question?

You just had seven tacos.

Okay.

Hey, seriously you guys!

You what??

Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine?

Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!

Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!

We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas.  That means we have to be back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark.

Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?!

Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere.

Well, okay... here... l'see...

I love you guys. 

I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry!  What the hell?!

Would you like some more tea, Polly Prissy Pants?

They're listening. Let's go! 

What??  Really??  YES!! YES!!

He has to. He's been ordered by the court.

Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah.  We here this a million times back up in the States.

Hmmm.  Hmm, not bad. 

Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way. 

I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.

Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!

Just the good times.

Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know.

Time to go, Mr. Hankey.

But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank?  Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie.

You're going down, Butters! You hear me?!

Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen? 

I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.

Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.

That's a very pretty dress. 

Yeah!

- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -

Eeehh, I don't want to see a educational video-o. 

Protect who??

If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream? 

A book signing.

How was it?

That's not what we just heard!

They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of them tomorrow!

I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you?

Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?

Believe it, dude.

What the hell is gahekgafuga?

Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!

But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.

I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week.

I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive!

Hello, fren! Hello!

Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike.

Yeah, so what?

Oh heell now!  Mom! Dad's being mean to me! Mem! MEEM! 

You told me I was a ghost!

I don't Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.

Heh heh, yeah?

No, no, it was a stupid mistake!

WEEEEEEAK!!!

I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will have his nuts!

Hey hey, how's it going, bros? This is CartmanBrah. CartmaaanBrah. And uhh, we are, it looks like we are at the bus stop now.  Yep, there's Kyle, Stan andn Kenny looking stupid as ever.

Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch.

Oh, that's so sweet you guys.  You wanna go get a room so you can make out for a while? Heheheheheh 

NOOO! 

...Should that really matter at a time like this?

Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!

Well...

What?! Who?!

Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out.

That's not fair!

God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I'll catch you at recess.  Fist bump. Fist bump, bro. 

We were in a good mood, just jokin' around, you know, mostly making fun of Kenny's herpes.

Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here!

Okay, okay, hold your horses! God!  Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature!

Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay!

Hey you guys. Seriously. 

You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember. 

Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass...

What? No. No.  Kyle, no!

No, Kitty, it's mah pot pie!  Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!

Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys?

I like going to school now. Jakovasaurs are so cool. 

Huh?

I was getting to that, if you will let me.  Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called "daywalkers." 

Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how "do" you act nice to people?

What?

Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it.

Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all friends again. Our two houses brought together. Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s.  And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs.  Now, if you'll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit.  What have you found out?

It's boring news, Jimmy.

A what?

Butters, come on!

Fuck you Kyle!

No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse.

Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.

Jesus, he sure ran that one into the ground.

Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the fuck do you think you are?!

Did so!

Hang on a second here. 

You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!

Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field.  I have a question. What does Wendy Testaburger actually do? She is supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let's ask these questions.  Today I wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy. The bake sale last week was a complete failure. And in the school-  And besides that, who actually voted for Wendy Testaburger? I know I didn't. And everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' "Whoops. Guess I shouldn't have done that."  I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school.

Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television?! 

Yeah, that's fine.

Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.

Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say "Amen!"

Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.

Damint! Give me all you've got, then! 

I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more...

Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now. 

One please. 

Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward.  NASCAR! Yee-ah!

You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!

Oh, fuck my ass again! 

And his momma cried
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
Is another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto In the ghetto

Alright, "start your engine." What's that mean?

Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen.  Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much.

Oh dude, I just got the best idea

Reverse to you, Jew. 

Ey, you backstabbin' sellout!

Wait a minute.  Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh!  There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken!

No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.

Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch. 

Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring.

One thousand dollars, yeah!

Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?

Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on! 

I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog.  Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had. 

No! No, this can't be happening! 

Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?

You're gay!

What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-

Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.

Kyle's brother?

You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?

Odline daur shunba shunba?

Oh no!

...Okay.

Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brakes! Bye Kenny. 

Jeh

Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!

Gay.

Oh, how about Stan? Or Kyle?

... 'Kay. Sweet.

That's it! Party is over!  Everybody go home!  GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! THE PARTY'S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT! 

Woohoo! 

That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long.

This asshole needs to make a move already!

...play stupid games.

Eh, not right this second, mother. Put them there by the door.

Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this,  but I am sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!

Oh God.

Oh my God.

Stan... beaver dam!  Very large beaver dam, Stan!! 

Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys.

No! I hate hippies!

But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank!

Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out.

Don't worry, I have that covered.  Mom?

It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay!

I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles. 

You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich!

What?

Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle!

How about a taco, that craps ice cream?  Guys?

Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over.

Eh, we kick ass.

Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean han.

AHHHHHH.

He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on "Nurse Jackie" and on "Rockin' The Boat."

Butter- Butters!
Kyle:
Hey Butters!

That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West. 

Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer.  Now let's see... The setup could be... "Do you like fishsticks?"

Did he say "the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world"?

Yes, we sure do.

Not at all, but go on. 

Listen to this!  Dickhead. 

Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.

Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!

Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Well you're a fuckin' Jew Kyle! And now you're a Mexican Jew! You dirty, no good... Mexijew!  Let's just see you try and-!

You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!

I know, it sucks. 

Wha-? Uh oo  why do you want then back so much?

...deh..OOOWW!!!

Don't call me an asshole, you som' bitch.

Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott!  Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet.

Awesome.

Parents? Parents?!  Oh God! 

Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this!

Every time I go to my Grandma's house, she gives me a present. You watch: as soon as I walk in the door she'll hand me a biiig present, for no reason, except that I'm cool.

Because  of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!

No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.

Sweeet!

Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know!

Hey, what the F?!

Kyle, cast arcane missile!

I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold!

Still want to leave, Token?  Thank you.

Alright, places everyone.

Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move!  We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese!

What's goin' on, guys?

It's Butters.

No! Dude, I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I'm gonna-  Hey, hang on a second, Lawrence.  I think we have a Nosey Nancy in the room.  Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. If I'm gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, then I'm gonna need something better than Twitter.

No.

What?!

Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  Look, see that traffic signal down there?  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free.

It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded.  I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?

Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town.

Okay.  Stan, let's be partners, dude. 

Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!

Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass! 

Come on, Wing!

Shut your God-damned mouth!

Whoa!

Don't worry, nobody can see us wearing black.

And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?

Thank you, Mr. Broflovski.

Ah, screw you hippies!

Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face.

Okay. 

Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle. 

...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always been sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I- I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know.

He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us. 

Listen! I have a nice body and I want to show it off, you got that?

Really? You don't think so?

Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.

WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!

Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?

See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys. 

Shh, quiet, Cupid Me.

Yeah, it sucked Hairy Butters' chin balls. 

Who needs a coach? We have Butters.

Beefcaake!

Atone?

Watch this. It's sooo funny.  Come 'ere, dog, come on.  Good dog.  Red rocket red rocket.  Red rocket. Red rocket.  Come on. 

Go play with yourself, Craig.

Waaait! Waitwaitwaaait!

You guys, I am seriously getting pissed off right now! I know there is no such things as aliens!  Oh, God damn it!

Who's there?

Dude, what are you doing?

Uh-ho-ho, man, that's hella funny! 

Where's that?

You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.

No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television.

Dude, they totally think he's a girl. 

Tampon? What's a tampon?

So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker.

Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!

What?

Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!

Totally.

I get to use it first you guys!  Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?

My man can do whatever he wants.

No, Kenny.

Ummm, no?

Racist! 

Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?

Oh my God, you guys. Look!  They do have an amazing fountain. 

Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like!  Right, Mom?!  Mom?!

God-dammit!! Do I have a dad?!

Should I get it?

Shut up, Fluffy! 

Jeez, that girl is pissed off.

Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!

We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!

What's it say, what's it say?

Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter

I'm trying to trick-or-treat God dammit!

No room at the inn, Virgin Mary. 

Butters?  Butters?! 

Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you. 

Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!

God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! 

HA!  For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer.  This first picture I like to call "Moods of Winter" , a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?

Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank!

But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!

Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw.  We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico!

What dude?

Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?

What? What do you mean I know that?

This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me.

Why?

Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!

Ugh, alright, alright, hang on.  Security!

No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off. 

Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!

Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?

Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez

No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore.

Stop, you guys! I can't think!

Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play!

How the hell was that a strike?!  Goddamnit, he's going to first!

You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease.

Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.

Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.

Can I have the yellow with a side of white?

No, that was just a dream.

Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone.  Dude, I'm on fire today!

Huh?

We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter.

Reading sucks ass.

Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat. 

Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?

You see, in America we have... log rides!  Bacon double-cheeseburgers!  Sheep-shearing contests!

Get really psyched up, Butters!

Oh God!

But you said-

Shut up, dude, you're being totally immature.

Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars! 

We know a way inside the Red Robin.  You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how.

What in the hell are they doing?

I told you, Token.

Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!

Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!

Okay.  Here we go, pack of chewing gum. 

Come on, Craig!

Man, this guy sucks.

Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.

No. There is something I can do.

All right Butters, we're here.  Are you ready?

Aah! Kyle!  Kyle! 

If I go, you guys go!

How is the incubation shield coming Clyde?

Ugh... what?  What's going on?

No thanks. Okay, proceed.

Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?

Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.

Alright,

What?! 

Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.

Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?!  Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!

We've got to fight them off!  Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!

Oh my God, isn't it awesome having an iPad, you guys?  Hey Bebe, where's your iPad? Oh right, you're not cool enough!  Hey, hey, did you see my iPad, Token? Funny, you don't seem to have one! I thought your family was rich!  Haha! You dumbasses have to play four-square 'cause you don't have iPads!  Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? Think I'll email some of my friends. Oh no, wait! Maybe I'll download some more cool apps!  This is so awesome! 

Oh, okay.I guess I understand. 'I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...''I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...

My... girrrrrrrl... 

My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money.

What?!

Ey! You used to work for me!  Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonofabitch! 

Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it!

Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Token?  Who, who else needs a partner?  Uh who else needs a partner?

Dildo!

Stinky britches, you got stinky--

How about we do a show where we kill Butters? 

NO!  Oh God, oh God it's so good.

...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!

Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week.

Goddamnit!  Who the fuck do they think they are?!  This is the last fucking straw! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!

Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line! 

Stan, you guys are good! 

Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds.

I like it.

Eheh. You got in trouble, you got in trouble.

Alright, let's start wrestlin'. 

Think of the power!

What the hell are you doing?

See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.

I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. 

You piece of crap! I'll kill you!

God, I'm glad you guys know all these "pooping outside" rules!  Urgh. Come on, now.

Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!

Oh, man, I wish I knew how to spell.

So interesting, wow. 

Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack? 

Dude dude dude! Check it out. 

Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!

I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers.  Alright, these are good to go! 

I'm not fat! I'm big-boned!

He's not dead.

Jews...

No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!

That's right!

And knowing is half the battle.

Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency.

Just let me get my cowboy hat.

As if we care.

Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!

Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-

Praise Christ! Let's go! 

Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Turd Sandwich."

Sleep!

No! My wife, Token! Token, that's my wife!

What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants?

Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.

Who'd you expect? Maury Povich? Golly, you're hella lame!

Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it!

KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!

Moooommm!

Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?

Twinkle in my eye.  haha. HahaHAAhahahaha. 

You bitch, I'll cut your throat if- 

Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store! 

Fuck you, Danica Patrick! You ain't half as dumb as me! Gas pedal! 

And you feel like you have to confess.

What's he doin' here? 

Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away.

You capitalist swine, I'll crush you!

Sweet. I think we're next in line now.

I hope we're not wasting our time with this little pecker.

Jews...

Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!

God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!

Eh- shut up, you half-Chad!

Suck my asshole, taco vendor!

No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions.

Have you ever tried it?

Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location.

Just now -  1 2 3 dibs! 

I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure.

Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!

Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.

Cool. 

Scuzzlebutt kicks ass!

Uh oh. 

Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: "At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000" 

Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.

That son of a bitch!

I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!

Please don't call on me. Please, Jesus, don't let him call on me.

...No, he has an icy heart.

Whoa, look at Bebe!  I had no idea Bebe was that hot.

The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on! 

No!

I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, "Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!" 

Hi, Grandma. It's me, Eric.

You gotta be kidding me!

You guys, we have to bring Christmas to those less fortunate!  Now come on!

That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days!

Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race,  then I need those cigarettes.

All right!

Really? Are you sure?

All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Token?!  I didn't think so! 

Last time, when Butters spent the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.

You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them!

No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool! 

Dude, she's a chick!

Oh great! You see, Stan?! This is what you get for listening to Kyle!  "Oh, you've gotta help those people. It's your responsibility."

Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?

Oh. We don't know him.

You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.

Oh Jesus Christ.

Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh?

Hey you guys. I know a scary story.

Ahaaa!

You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society.  Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today?

All right!

Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.

Hi, Grandpa!

Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse!

Sweet. Oh, yeah, sweet. That's super sweet. Ah-yes!

I'm ready!  Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool. 

Four.

Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.

Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm starving to death!

I said "Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!"  Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina?

Seriously! Ey? Eh... 

Oh! You fucking bitch! 

You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!!

The Black Jackal. Karate Kick Panel Force and bendable neck-

Oh boy, here we go.

Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see.  no  No.  NO!  God-damnit 

Kevin, god-damnit..! 

Hey! My mom says you're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed to call it a fireman.

Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he's about to rape my mom.  Go go, she's upstairs.  Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white!

Kewwwl!

I will! James West, cowboy and rap star!  Quick, Artemus Clyde Frog! We've got to save Salma Hayek!

Hahah. Very funny, you guys, hahah. 

Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come!  Hey! Where is it!

So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.

'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean "That's all right"! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!

Well, here goes everything. 

That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.

I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out.

Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!

Excuse meh.

Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!

Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...

Come, Kyle. Do hurry.  Go ahead, it won't bite. 

That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig.  Cause its poop is small.

Probably in your front pocket, dumbass!

You don't think we're any good, do you?!

All right, everyone! Forward, march!  Es ist Zeit für Rache!

I don't know.  I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole.

Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?

Fireman!

I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', "Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!"

Dude, Wendy plays volleyball. Did you know that? I don't think you knew that.

Do you think?

I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough.

I can't! Kick yourself back to safety!

Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!

Look.  But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through. 

Wir egal un die Comedy Awarding Thing. Es war Kinder der special education. Sie macht uns wählen. 

Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here right now!

Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-

Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?

What-evah. I digitally put Jabba the Hutt back into the original Star Wars movie! I'll do what I waunt!

You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties.

No, but you've gotta cry, like this:  "My parents molestered me."  And then they'll say something like, "Was it a good touch or a bad touch?" and you say  "Uh, it was a good touch" or- no wait,  you say it was a bad touch.

No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  There we go.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?

Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine.

Hey, get offa him! He's not dead yet!

He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget.

What?

Holy crap! 

Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!!  You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!!  AAAAAA!! 

Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!

Hey, there you are! 

You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!

Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now.

Hurry up in there!

And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.

Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call.  Gebaayybeh!  Gebaayybeh!

Kenny? Kenny?  Kenny?  Wanna look at Playboy?  Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?

Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of  Scuzzlebutt?

Dammit, where's that calamine lotion?!

That'll do pig.

Boinsure li bonsure.

Ohhhhhhhh?

No! No, I hate Family Guy!! 

Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip. 

Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?

After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again!

Heh...  what?

Oh my God, somebody shoot me in the head!

He said you kissed her with your tongue.

Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde.

Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.

Stupid assholes! 

Sorry.  A little gassy. 'Scuse me.

Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!

Ahaha, okay okay it's getting old. 

What the hell are they doing?

Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a  Sega Dreamcast?

The nightmare begins.

All Jews carry gold in a little bag around their necks! Hand it over!

Alriiight!

Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants!

That's cool. You wanna write some together? 

We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot.

I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.

You broke Kickstarter!

It should be Sexy News.

Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh...

Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom?

Okay.  Kugheek! 

The answer to #28 is 14.

There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training! 

Ah, fuck you, Token! You black asshole! 

But I wanna sing the Cheesy Poofs song on the commercial!

Somebody, I guess, was spying on Craig's mom and they got pictures of her bush, and it's like, it's like a yeti. You guys wanna check it out? 

Bye bye Billy.  Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good.

I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. "Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."

Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle!  Huh, I guess you're clean. 

Eh-sure.

That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek?

No! No I'm fine!  I just need to get home, a-and rest.

Me and my crew are gonna go on piratin' forever! 

Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!

Because I don't want a chick watching me go poo!

Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it.  All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here.

Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act.

Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe!

Seriously. Help.  Screw you guys. Hate you guys.

Ohh, rainbows. Yeah, I like those, those are cool.

Hey dude. Sup? 

I'm just letting you know how special you are to me.

No you don't!

Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts  and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade.

Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca.  We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. 

It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium!

Stupid Facebok stuff.

I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool.

Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?

I said GET. Mr. Hat!

Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass.

I love you, dad.

Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!

Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays.

...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!

Look you guys! Beef jerky!

God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!

Hey! What's going on? What is that? 

I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.

Yes, Mr. Thompson?

Butters, I need your help.

Ah, dammit!

Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy.

Hey bros, what's going on? This is CartmaaanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already, 'cause subscribing makes you feel good! Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty. More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start. 

She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that. 

Wow! Casa Bonita?!

Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine! 

You see Token, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... Seeing African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha, how should I say... white.  Token, all the great African-Americans newspeople have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings.

Alright, fine! Well then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. But we want you to know that its been really fun. Here's a watch, and some peanuts. 

Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself.

Well, keep tryin', Butters.

Aw, God dammit!  Aww- awww, dude!

We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!

If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed! 

Oh, do we wanna do that?

Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work.

Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!

Sir, step out of the car, please.

Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math.

What? What was that? Butters? Token?!  Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh!  You guys?! GUYS!

And so the party returns home after completing their great quest.

It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!  Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool.  No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak.  What?

Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess!

Pfff..!

Dude, you can't shop for crap. 

Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!

This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?!  You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.

Well, I'll be damned.

--you're my fantasy, you fanta--

Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy.  You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah. 

Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese. 

Ha! You just got f'd in the a!

Aha! Kenny! I should have known!  Why do you have a picture of Mysterion in your locker, Kenny?!  Unless you are Mysterion!

When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.

Why not?

Cool!

Tell me where the gold is or you die!  Slow! 

Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude! 

I've got to buy Chinpokomon... I've got to... buy them... Must buy Chinpokomon...

Suck my balls, Kyle. 

Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!

No,  no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong.

Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.

Not me!

Never! I'll get that triangle if it's the last thing I do!

Really? I wanna be a cop.

So does that mean I'll never laugh again?

Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?

Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.

Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!

Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii?

What? But uh, why should I sue the school?

Yeah. Poor grandma...

And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly...

Oh look out, Holly Hobby's all pissed off! 

Hippies!

Es ist Zeit fër Rache!

You're gonna send me to hell?

No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries.

Sweet.  Mom, somebody's at the door.

Hey guys, listen!  I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe.

Dude...

Me? You're the one talking about killer titties.  Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people.  Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!

There he goes.

Aaah!!!

You asshole! 

Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now.

It's "Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis" funtime game. You have to decide if you deny it or cover it up.

Jews...

We sure are.

But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong. 

I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us.  "Oh, thank you, guys." You're welcome, Kenny.

Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are!

Goddamnit people! With a yo ho ho!

Help me! Hellp mee!

Boo! I'm a ghost.

Dude, this is my fuckin' bathroom!

I'll momaymumyeu, Meemuhmammy.

What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!

Attention! All right, you booty lovers! So you decided to join Captain Cartman's edjeh...  Uh, guys, who let in the g-i-n-g-e-r?

Sh! You hear that?

Well I'm glad you think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!

All right, let's roll! 

Oh Jesus, not you guys?  What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!

Wait a minute. This isn't a present, it's a shirt! 

Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?!

Alright, football night, what do you do?
Get out your camera and a boobie or two.

Oh really?  Then, why don't you hold it?  Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it.  Hold it.

God-damnit! 

The other way to stop the outbreak. Token isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida!

Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you.

Kenny!

Yes, I know.

"Or does she?" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!

Where the hell is everybody?! I'm gonna be on TV tonight. You guys better not miss it!

Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!

YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN, EH! NOW I CAN'T MAKE THE ULTRA MEGA MEGA MAN, YOU DIRTY CHEAP-ASS PIECE OF CRAP! 

Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another.

Goddamn,  I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me, I'd be like, "Hey! You stupid son of a bitch! You-- How... How'd you like me to kick you in the nuts?!"

What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.

Yes!

Nothing.

Is it her?

Nononono! You nyah, me nyah!  Screw you guys, I'ma going home.

Wwaargh. Not right now, Mom. 

Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.

Thanks, you guys.

No, Kyle! I don't believe you!

Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision.  Butterscotch candy?

I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.

A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some-- 

Peter!

Hey, Butters.

We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.

He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!

Hooray!

Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. 

Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode!

I'm gonna go jam my thumb in some'in's butthole now.

Uh seriously! Mom! Must go! Must buy!

Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got!

Have you lost your mind?

Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well...  let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. 

Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.

Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew.  No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew.

Well, come on, we don't have a choice. 

I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade!

Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.

Everybody's gonna be sooo jealous when they see my Chinpokomon. 

We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!

That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.

People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?

What do you mean?

Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make.

I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?

Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.

And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he?  Is he a hero or a menace?  While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other... "Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right?" What we all need now-  Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important.  What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with my camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too.

Well do you mind tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig?

This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!

Are you okay, Salma Hayek?

Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?

Who's there?

And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!

Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name! 

Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass! 

Oh my God. Token, aren't you stoked?  Aww, that's awesome, Token. I'm happy for you.

You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that.

Mr. Mackey, what is a moronic jizzrag?

Yeah! Now get out of here before I kick you in the nuts!

I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? and there are a hundred and ninety black people!

Fuck you!

Set phasers on stun.

Come on everybody,
It's Faith Hilling time.
Dancin', rappin', titties flappin' where are you?
This is the only memeing I'll ever do.

Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!

Yeah!

Okay, let's have 'em.

Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!

What kind of smartass thing would I say, Mr. Garrison?

Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.

This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!

Sweet.

Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. &lt;/&gt; There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top.  Good.

Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro?

Come on, kitties. Outside. Come on.  That's it. Come on, come on.  Uh oh.

Yeah, that was kewl huh?

Alright, I think we go over there. 

Why?

Kenny, it doesn't go "Pakew! Pakew!", it goes "BANG BANG BANG!!" 

Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever.

Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?

You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault.

But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.

All done!

Ahhh, this is the best day of my life. 

Yes.  A chocolate friend.  Mr. Candy Bar doesn't judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy Bar likes you just the way you are.  Look at how yummy and sweet he is.  ...There you go. That'll just be four dollars.  ...There you go.

Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.

Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is.

Man, this is stupid.

Well, I'm sorry!

No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu-  AAH!  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

...65, 66, 67... 

Ahh, Aahhhh! 

Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it.

Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over!

They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to give it to them.

...Very impressive, Kyle. But the holiday special is beginning soon. I'm afraid I can't let there be any distractions.  You will find that my door has been sealed with a 3/4 inch plywood and a polymer-metal alloy secured with drewall screws. 

Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Token, I would like you to meet my lawyer!  As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air!

Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.

It is, too! 

Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter. 

Was that how it happened?

But what does he do besides that he's cute?!

Well why don't you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don't you tell everyone what Prometheus was about while you're at it?!

You guys, you know Pete Melman?  Fourth Grade, Mr. Bart's class?

The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on! 

So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!

I guess, damn! 

Where is the Nintendo?

Do I get a nightstick?

Wait a minute! I've got it, you guys! We can get Kyle infected with AIDS! And then start a charity organization that we steal money from! Come on, let's go!  No? We can't give Kyle AIDS?

What, dude? 

My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!

Talangar the Black returns from watching the video. 

Come on buddy.  Get out of here!  Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight!  Fight! Fight! Right now!  Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight!  Fight!  Give him some air.  There, easy. Breathe easy. 

Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?

Where is it, you filthy Jew?!

Ohh my God!  Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?

No, Kitty, this is my corned beef cabbage!

What have you got, Marsh?

Hahahaha haa ha!

Nice. And with a yo ho ho!

There we go.  Come and get it.  ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it.  Come on, good pony. That's it!  Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony!  Oh no, pony, he'll like that.

Did you notice the bow?  I'm not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth, so I'm exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice. Now get out of my way. I have to take a shit.  Aaahhh!

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! 

You're what? What, you say?

Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible.

Jakov, please don't go.  You make everything in South Park fun.  You brought life to this whole town. It would suck without you.

Turn around so I can clean out your ass.

That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular "Magic: The Gathering" look like girls volleyball.

Ugh.

Alright, go ahead.  AY!... no.  AY!...

I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.

What?

I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if we were super-high level too?

Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy!

Yuhwell, you're not dreaming!  Ey! Cut the crap!

Alright!

Get off of me, Christina Aguilera! Alright?! Please! Hegh, hegh

I'm back own the track.  What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?!

Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas.  Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going?

Oh dude. Sweet.

I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video?

Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!

What's going on?

This sounds like a really important quest.

Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say??

Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man, somebody stop my guts frm bursting out of my sides! 

Yeah, pretty much.

These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?!  Get out of my sight!  Lousy little scum!  What?!

Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent film that  isn't about gay cowboys eating pudding!

Guess.

Who let the dogs out?

Can't go on. Need... food...

Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!

Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself!  Come on, Butters, we're going!

Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?

Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?

I believe that's us... thank God. 

We were saved. It was over.

No, that's not that funny. Let's try something else.

She what?!

My God, this thing must really be powerful. 

And Worf?

Yes, well, we weren't.

It's time to celebrate, yeahIt's time to celebrate, yeah

Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt!  I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!

Yeah. Do we really need another one?

Well, I know one thing for sure.

Safe where, butthole?!

So what can we do??

...What the hell is a hate crime?

Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. 

Hey!

Fish dicks! Aw dude, that's funny as shit! I think we're really onto something here. Let's try it out on the guys.

Sweet!

What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay?

I am trending so much that soon I will reach... trendscendence. Like Johnny Dep, but cool.

We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.

Not a word, Kenny!

Well, look at him. He's all, you know, uh l-look at him. 

Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?

Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that needs to be sucked out, please.

That's right.  Guys with Cash For gold Signs gets you People's Unwanted Crappy Jewelry, which when added to a Cable-Based Shopping Network divided by Demented Old people equals Gold. 

Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me!

Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars.

But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?

You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! 

Yes, but they're sand monkeys!

I'm going to the potty.

Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. 

Wow, cool!

Eh! God-damnit! 

Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.

KYYYLE!

I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold.  This way, I can move about the crowd of people undetected.  Here, hold this stuff for me.

But how do we start a fire?

Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?! 

Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines.

...What?

Hey! Whoooa.

For everything bad I've ever done?

All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever.  "Cartman's Passover Holiday Special", starring, THE JEWPACABRA! 

Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with?

Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!

Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine ceeeents?  Wall-Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you again?  Yes, Wall-Mart. I understand. 

Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!

Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things!

I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy.

Oops, busted. 

I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change.  The sun hurts my eyes. 

You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest "fuck you" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo. 

Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?!

No, you didn't.

The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!

Well.  Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it.

"Warm nuts", she said.

Well, yeah.

Yes.

I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!

You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?

Really?

The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.

So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times.  Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a "What Would Jesus Do" bracelet!

There it is! Come on, everybody! 

Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan.

According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.

Kyle, we need to try to find a-

No way!

I almost got you! Almost! 

Eeeeugh.

Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep. 

Guilty! I thought so! 

Well, what?

It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!

Let's do this. 

Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass.

Yeah.  We'll see you later, Kyle.  Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents.

Ah!  Ow, stop it!  Ah! 

Haahaahahaha!  Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!

Yes way! Check it out! 

It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!

I'm afraid I can't let that happen.

All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.  Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the qualifications, let's see...  Oh, I know. How about- 

Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often.

But my mom says you're the guy she was with.

Stay away from us, Trent!

Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court.

T, H. "Th." There. Hey, this is easy!  I'm gonna win the spelling bee for sure, Mom!

Hate you guys.

Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff!

So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler.

...Good job, Jew!

Youuu save it all?

...my, my mom?

Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!

All right, let's try over here.  Set up traps there, and there as well.  Last time I saw him he ran right through here. 

Who are you?

Sleep!

You know what we gotta do, guys?  We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party

I only need one, dude. I only need one.

Well pull harder!

Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER! 

Really?

Great. Now can we go?

I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.

I love Cheesy Poofs-

Heyesss.

Follow me to the bathroom. 

Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see. 

Yeah well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Token.  He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in.

Hit it, Tweek!  In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there's a lots of-

Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.

Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom?  
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.
She's a mean ole bitch 'cause she has stupid hair, 
she a bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch 
she's a stupid bitch!
Kyle's mom's a bitch and she's just a dirty bitch!
KYLE'S MOOOM IS A - BI-I-I-ITCH - aahh.

All right, so where's my ice cream?

Your show is fuckin' gay, dude!

Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks!  How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it.

Two percent, have my penis cut off.  Two percent-

So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.

This Saturday! Awesome!  Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere.  Casa Bonita!

Oh, it's a double-cross!!

HAAAAGH! 

After Red Racer, of course.

Chickenlover!

Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!

Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk.

Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. 

I'm not saying it.

I'm up to 94, thank you very much.

Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a great mother.  Such a beautiful mother.

And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints , and a guitar! 

Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas. 

It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country!

No! Dude! No fucking way!  Dude! 

Haha! I'm totally wet! This is awesome!!

Mom! Seriously! Let's go to the toy store, Mom. Now! Must go! Toy store!

Sweet.

Okay, we'll try this again.  Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to-  Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy.  Hello, HungDaddy.  "Hi. I'm eight and a half inches." Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf.  Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets.  Midgets piss me off. Frowny face.  Lemme see, how about this one?

You guys, something's wrong.

I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. 

Oh dude, sweet! 

Okay, we need to start immediately, please.  Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight!

Uh, excuse us for a second... 

You mean the other jakovasaur?

Oh no! The tape jammed! 

It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.

Ay!

What the hell happened to him?

...Wait, wait, what about Butters?

Look.  I put the stem cells from all the fetuses I had next to a Shakey's, and they ARE replicating a new Shakey's!  It worked! 

Oh, yes. We must do it again.

AGH!  DAAGGHHHH!!

So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan?

Naw, sh-she was with you!

Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?

He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it!  Ow. 

We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth is going out with that...Richard Greco guy that used to be on 21 Jump Street but then he got his own show for just a little while- 

No, they won't!

Well just, give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp.

...Huh?

Stinky britches, you got stinky, stinky--

Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!

Wingstreet?!

I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her.

I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat.

I'm gonna kill you, Kyle.

What? What'd I do?

Haha! In your face, Craig!

Alrighty.

That's totally weak!

Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.

Oh, that was close.

What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!

I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot.

Gawh, this is really good, Scott!

Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away. I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper to be overThe ways of my Trap--

Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!

I'm not fat, I'm festively plump.

Agh! Careful, you assholes!  To the left, you guys, left.  No, camera left, camera left!  That's it, now down. 

No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!

No, it has to be Kyle. 

What's that?

This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now.  Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. 

Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?

No! What Alec Baldwin commercial?

Aaand cut!  Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got!

Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money.

Why? Did you find something?

Me who?!

But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?

Oh!

Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life.

No, no, wait, you don't understand.  since I was th-three years old it has been my dream to have one million dollars...

I haven't made any money yet.

Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?

What?!

Alright, guys, here we go.  Hello, sir!

Well, I did a lot of thinking. And you know, guys, there's an important lesson I think we've all learned. What do we do when the tables are turned?
The day's looking brighter. Gray skies are turning blue.
'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not) the poor kid at school!
Kenny's back and it's such a thrill. Now I'm rich just like Stan and Kiul!
All that matters is no one thinks I'm a tool! 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not)
That's right, the poor kid in school.
Sing it with me, guys!
He's not the poor kid in school. (He's not)
I'm not-

Hello, sir, my name is Kris
Kristofferson. I'm with the IRS. I'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes.

I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters,  Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents.

That's a low blow, Stan.

I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off.

Gah, French people piss me off.

Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome.

No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes.

Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-

Now, let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time, Frenchy.

Wow!

I think... you and I might be able to help each other here today.

What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about "McNuggets"?

--special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets.

Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!

I just can't believe Slash isn't real,

Uuh. Definition?

Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!

That's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want! 

Yeah. 

Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire!  Yes! Yes! I have it now!

Wow! Cool!

Oh right. Someone like me can be a NASCAR driver.  Look at me!  Do you really think someone like this can ever become an awesome, famous NASCAR driver? 

You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson.

Haha! Stupid assholes! I got your time phone! 

What the hell?  Kenny, get out of here!

Who?

That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.

No, we don't wanna get high!!

Set off diversion track C! 

Dude, we don't wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head! 

The FUCK?!

No you're not.

That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now.  That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth.  Ow. OW. OW!

You guys, you're so funny. No matter how I'm feeling, I can always count on you guys to lighten me up.

And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?!

Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge

I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid.

Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him.  Zi-  Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross.

What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why!

We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You just can't sit on your ass and expect some money to appear!

Oh, Holy Jesus, God...

...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person.

Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums!

How much?

A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods?

...Sweet.

Yeah, I feel great. Why?  You think something's wrong? 

Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys!  I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!

Oh yeah?! I'll bet you five bucks that when you die you crap your pants, asshole!

No way!

My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters.

...Why are you doing this?

Of course. That's why we're here.

Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, "How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't  gonna  work  on  me  ha  ha  ha . Only one of us can be in the commercial, gentlemen. The game... is on. 

We'll go to LA with your wife. All she has to do is go on the show, do all the performing, make all the money, and leave the rest to us. 

This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?

I'll fill you full of lead!

Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! 

Alright, we've gotta do something.

Oh fine, go on and leave! I'm gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I'm gonna have your fuckin' balls! Fly to Christ.

No Token! Stop beating my daughter! NOOO! 

Oh, uh-uh Kelly. Kelly invited me.

Could you please use it in a sentence?

I got it! I got the Wii!

Uh huh.

No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!

Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks!

I...  told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.

Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong! 

Whoa, here it goes! 

Heh, that's not scary.

Butters, you have to help me!

Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!

Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee.

It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.

Oh, I think I see where this is going. 

Yes, please. 

You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!

Wwwhy??

You guys have stuffing?!

And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?

I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta! 

...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek. 

Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want!  Whatevuh! I'll do what I want!

Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh.

Beth! Bear-mace that guy!  Let's check out the rooms! Leeroy and Kyle go that way! Beth, you come with me!

Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.

Coming through. Oh how humiliating.  Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel.  Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have-  Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line!

Better! With a yo ho ho!

The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.

I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills.

Jakov!

Okay, ready? I'll go first. 

It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?

Mr. Loaf, we are selling candy bars for our dying friend.

Whoa, dude, look over there!  Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!

Okay.

I'm not eating the cupcake.

Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!

Oh YES!! 

Ey! Don't call me fat!  Mom, don't laugh.

It was Kyle.

We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you.

How do I reach these keeds?  The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time.  This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top.

Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you! 

Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today.

Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids.  Eh, oh yeah?! We- well you guys are assholes!  Grow up! 

Lame...

It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters.

He stuttered like a bitch! I've got this job in the bag!  Who are you?

What?

I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go!

You've ...already done all the work?

Oh, I get it.

I'm not too busy, Stan.

Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!

I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.

Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls. 

Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance?

It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. '

Hey. 

Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!

He's going to eat his own head.

There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future!

You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down.

Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom! 

Hey,  that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there. 

I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller?  Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.

Take the fort!

Nnnn-mo...

Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro?

Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.

Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere!  Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! 

Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here.

Okay. Okay Wendy. I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now.

You just want me to open the door!

Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live.

Why not?

What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other.

Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.

OOHHH!! 

Whah!

Put it on!  Do the voice.

I don't wanna die on this- bus with you assholes!  You guys suck!

Your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place.

I win!

Son of a bitch!  Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?!

Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss you are, Craig.

So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like "Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!" And Clyde is all like "Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!" Dude, it was a riot.

And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!

We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.

No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!

I broke the egg.

Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?!

AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint.

What news?

All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!

Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.

Ah I don't think so, dude. 

You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! 

Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke!

Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!

Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch!

That's not what we said.

Food!

Oh, really?  That's gonna cost some points. 

Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says  "Step 2.  Add the Sea People eggs to the water; you will see sea life spring instantly."  Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready?

Can somebody drive us to the mall?

Fine!

I get to wear it first, you guys.

Egh... 

Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it!

My God...

Thanks!

Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.

Stop it now! Ugh-  No use, guys. He's got some sort of defense mechanism.

Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW! 

Uh oh.

What are you gonna do, Kyle?! Tell on me?!  Then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale!  Is that really how you deal with your problems?! Grow up, Kyle!  All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is.

He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!

We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?

Ur, s-sorry.  Go ahead.

I'm not a sellout! What's a sellout?

Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?! 

Dude, screw this!  Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!

Who is that? Is that Toby

Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body. 

No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!

Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever.

You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius!

Alright now, open presents! Open presents!

Heh. What do you mean? 

Eeyy!!

Butters!  Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help!

Spooky spider?

Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?

Can I do it doggie style?

Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush!

We got it! We got it! 

What?

Alright, that does it!  I'm sick of this shit and I'm not gonna be  taking it any longer!  You all pushed me to this! 

Hello. Is this the University of Colorado Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand you're currently doing research on stem cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in possession of some aborted fetuses that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty dollars a pound right now. ...How about a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my balls- I, I'll think about it.
Bosnod Medical Group? ...Yeah, I called earlier about the stem cells and the fetuses? ...Okay, hi Randy, yeah. ...Oh yes, they've been kept in a cool temperature, yeah. ...These are primo fetuses, Randy, I wouldn't jerk you around. ...So what can your company give me for 'em? ...Oh Randy, you're breaking my balls here. ...You're breaking my balls, Randy. 
Oh plehease! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses for seventy cents on the dollar? You tell me, Chuck? ...Yeah, I didn't think so-You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck. I wasn't born yesterday, either. Uh huh. ...So are you gonna talk to me, or are we just gonna keep bullshitting each other? Breakin' my balls, Chuck. 
I gotta unload these fetuses, you wanna do some research. Are we talkin' here or what? You're breaking my balls. ...I'm telling you, if you let this deal pass you by, you're making a fetal mistake.  That's a joke  ...A hundred ten. ...Alright, alright, we got a deal. ...Good bye.  Damn I'm good. 

And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew.

So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?

How?

No! Fuck off! 

Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny.

Oh!

Eeeyy!

I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.

Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls!  You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles. 

An iPad??? 

At least I'm not a stupid Jew.

She'll be the death of him, Kyle. Mark my words: she'll be the death of him.

Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can't expect people to want to watch. Okay?  All right.

Shit! Butthole!  Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry.  Titties! Cock!  Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface!

But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off.

Hey, that's bullcrap! How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?!

All right, hit one out of the park!

He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!

Ten dollar? Sucky-sucky?

Duhude, dude,  not cool!

Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off.  Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now.  Here. Write a diary.

So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! 

Thank you, Mrs. Garrison.  My speech is entitled "Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles."  We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids.  Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles.  Aw, nasty! Yuck!  This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls.

Hey, wait, aah!

Guess again.

"I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool."  Mom, answer that! "They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool." 

Oh, God-damnit!

More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring.

Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry! 

You love NASCAR huh?

It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right?

Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk

Heheh, totally, heheh.

I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.

Shut up you guys, it's not working.

All right, lock that door, Craig! 

Noo... NOOO!!  NOO! OW!

Would you like sauerkraut, German boy, German boy?Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut, Fräulein Setski 

... Huh?

Oh come on! We're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You think, you think Kyle isn't on the computer right now tryin' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gonna have such a field day, that heartless Jew!  Well I won't give him the satisfaction!

Butters, let go God-damn it!

Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, "Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."

What? That your parents lied to you, too?

What, Clyde?

Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?

What the hell is a "bris"?

Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-

Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you.

What?

But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus!

Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.

Yeah-uh, Token! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!

All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.

"Nothin'" Me neither. Nothin's goin' on. Sucks.  Everything good with you?

Hi, Doctor Lout.

Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. "Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one."

Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!

Make it go away! I hate Barbra Streisand! I hate her! 

Hey Kyle.

Oh did they? Uh I hadn't heard about that.

Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now.

Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!

No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! 

Come on, Stan, it's mine! I'll roshambo you for it! 

What do you know?!

Okay, I'm back.

Butters, are you there?!

Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!

You aren't listing to anythin-  Make it worth my while how?

Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly! 

Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls?

Ey, what the hell are you talking about?!  I'm not a god-damned Canadian, and neither are you!

Oh, dude, this is not cool!

Oh, balls!

Here we go!

That's not why I did it.

Look out, Artemus Clyde Frog! It's a giant metal spider!  Bang! Bangbang!  Yoyoyo, jiggity jiggy with it! Bang bang bang!  We saved the day! The Wild Wild West, The Wild Wild Wild West. Uhyo wicky wicky scratch, Uh wicky wicky scratch... 

Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars!  Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route.

Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win.

Well, he shouldn't have called me fat. 

But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?

Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?

I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded. 

Hey, look! They're giving away bread outside!

Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism?

Thanks you guys!

Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five?

Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!

But why? Why should they get the bell?

Oh, I'm sorry, but I thought we were at war with these assholes!

Butters, get out of here!

You what?! Are you insane?!

Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill.

Next please.

"Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?"

Well, I guess we'll have to roshambo for it.

I told you guys!

Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible.  I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit.  Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. 

Yeah, stop being a wuss!

Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.

I'm a bigger lesbian than you!

He's my father?! 

Right.

It is real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole!

Oh dude, this is pretty sweet.

No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.

Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!

I am the tooth fairy, my child.

Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies!

Excuse me...  This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?

All right, in you go.

Ahem. Me?

Eh-heheh!

Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass. 

What, dude, you got something?

Come on, Stan, it's first down still. 

Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness.  I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest.  We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary. 

Ready? Go! 

We're not moving.

Hey Clyde, Token. Sup, Jim? 

Avast there, mateys!  Do ya have a thirst for adventure on the high seas of life?  Arrre you sick and tired of your parents and teachers telling you what to do all the time?  Then join Captain Cartman's Perfect Pirate Club, arrrr!  Just imagine it, me hearties! A life without rules, without homework and chores! You can live the pirate's life in Somalia, me friends!  Even Kyle said so.  Our first official pirate mee'in will be 4 pm today at Kevin Stoley's house!

Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick.

Noo! I just need to get to a toilet. See you guys. I...  habbeh... HABBEHHHHHHHHHH! 

Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are?

Uugh!  Yeessss.  Ooohhh yyou guys, seriiously, it calms yer ass. Ahhhh... 

That asshole is not getting across my border! 

But we don't have to lose.

Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!

Look at how the crap ...is sittin' right in the middle! 

Dude!  You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. 

Jesus Christ! HAAAA!

Jews...

Aw, dude, I think I might have it.

How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?

Nooooooooo-! 

Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show.

Hey, what are you doing? 

What?!

That's not at all what happens.

Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.  I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second. 

"Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?" said the little boy in the red poofball hat.

Whatever, that's like five years from now.

Sarque du Son Bleu.  Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain.

You know, sand people.

All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now.

Oh, who just shot me? 

Yes yes, I see! 

Oh, how's Kenny gonna get one?! He's hella poor!

Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy!  Aaah!

Who did this to you?!

Yeah! 

Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to freeze myself.  Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii.

Aay!  Let's hurry. This costume is hot.

All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.

Suck my balls!

Just one more rose, Kyle.

Cool, these will be good uploads.

Aw, that is such bullcrap!

Because, Butters-

Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?

Ah! Quit it!

No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am! 

Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!

Wow, look at the size of these houses!

Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera again!  She's on my back! Hah! 

Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez.  Your new teacher.

Yeah, you guys are real hard core.

Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm not speaking with him?

What?

And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!

Put the lotion in the fuckin' basket!

Bad! Bad monkey! 

Then the game is on, Kyle.

Damnit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!

What a whore! 

Oh, you did it again! You all heard him!

Plunder the booty, lads! This ship is ours!

Can you tell me where the pube fair is?

Dude, totally.

Aw, man, let's get out of here!

Okay Mommy. Mamamama.

Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally.

That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?

Lying kicks ass!

It's done. 

But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee. 

Oh, damnit!

We're in fourth grade, Jimmy. We don't even know what ethical means.

That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade.

Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous.

Why the fuck am I here?!

What?

You're doing unnatural things in the house of God!

You were spying on me?!

Do you feel protected?

I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me.

Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents!  And what did I tell you, Kyle?!  I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?! 

I do not directly say she's a slut!

Yes it is! 

No? How about this? 

Ew, doesn't that hurt?

Ha-ha, you're a wuss. 

This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.

I'll never be able to prove that son of a bitch was here!  My Speak and Record bear. Of course.

Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. Fly fly fly...

A merger?! It's too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don't have a company! We don't have anything! 

Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.

Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!

Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle, of it, Kyle, of it Kyle...

Oh, are you gonna take us to your little pussy house?

Oh on that side?

But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?

Aw, man, smells like ass down here.

Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.

Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.

If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?

Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!

Yes, that's good.

You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I hate you!! 

Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?!  What's wrong with him?

Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!

Goddammit!  Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets.

Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack.  All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: "I mis-interpreted the rules." It's what you must also say when caught cheating! "I mis-interpreted the rules." Say it with me.

Uhokay. 

Holy shit!

He's a God damned butthole!

Sweet!

Yeah.

...ticket stub?

Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?

Meh. 

Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass.

No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?! 

This is bullcrap!  I can't reach the freezer!

Yes. Who would take care of them?

Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.

Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.

What? What happened?

Oh heeell NO you didn't just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST STRAW, Kyle!  Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an NSA agent right here at our school

No, just a bunch of goo.

Clyde, Clyde!  If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it?  I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?

Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! 

Oh, I'm sorry! Next time I'll just ask my fart nicely if it wouldn't mind staying tucked away for a while!

You have AIDS?

Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else.

Kyle?

Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all.  It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! 

No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!

Pass me the ball!  Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole!  Kyle, what the F?!

And a tricky lahty do!

The hell do you think you're doing?

We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole! 

Why?  Is your sister gonna kick your ass again?

Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!

He still looks pretty gay to me.

I don't have $3000.

Youu heard about that?

Ey! Seriously, dude! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!  Mother f- 

Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-

Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle? 

Oh Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.

Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming "NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!" You know this to be true.  Go ahead. Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle.  Do it. 

What are you up to?

I ain't done with you, bitch!

Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now!  We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come on! Come on!!  Mooooooom! Moooooooom!

I got a Christmas present! I got a Christmas present!  ...Maybe I can see what it is. I'll just open one little corner.  Let's see here.  That's good, I'll rewrap it later!  Oh, sweet! Life-sized blow-up Antonio Banderas love doll! With realistic geni-ta-lia.  Oh, this kicks ass! What a cool Christmas present my mom got! 

Yes we are!

I'll miss you too, COCKA-3.

Herr Kommandant Cartman has ways of making you talk! 

It's simple science, Kyle.

It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out.  Dude, no way! This thing is so epic! 

Get the rest of the stuff you guys!

Okay, that does it!  Screw this, I'm goin home!  Talking poo is where I draw the line!

God-damnit!

You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?

Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks. Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys! Ahahahahahahaa ha! 

Mom? Can I ask you a question?

...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer.

I need to speak with him, please.

All right, everyone ready?

KYYYLE!

What does that mean?

Is anyone starting to suspect anything?

MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!

I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow.

What?! I'm missing the new Fantasy Island.

Home-schooled kids? Who the hell are they?

Butters, l-listen to me, listen.

Well, come on guys. We gave it our best. 

Hengh!  Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS!  Hengh!

Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.

You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!

I left my charger at home!  Fine! I'm gonna go home and charge my iPad and bring it tomorrow, and you guys are gonna feel really stupid! 

Ooooohh.

I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.

Fantastic, then.

What?!

I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be!

Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.

Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle.

It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke.  I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. 

All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny?  What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle?  I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right. 

Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!

Why?!  Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why?!  Why?! 

Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed him up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!

Not like that, pony! 

However long Craig wants it to last.  T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge.

I was um, sure that the appointment was today.

That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya!  Hahahaha ha ha!

Come on, Kyle.

Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle?

Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy.

What the fuck is closure?!

Butters.

That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long!  What?

Dude, what's going on?

It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am going to lead you there!

Oh, no! Noooo!!

I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes.

Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast!  Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends!  Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon.  You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why?  Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.  If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street.  The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger  So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle.

What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?

You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down!

Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess.

I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.

What, Kyle?

We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita!  Aw man, this is gonna be so great!

Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the man?

Bail, bail! 

Praise the Lord-uh!

Cripple fight! 

Mom.can you go make me a toaster pastry chocolate-mix butter ball? 

That's it? That's all the commercials?

He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.

Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet! 

What the? 

Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm.

Hey, this is sweet.

I am the Dawg, the big bad-  Oh my God!  What the fuck is this?!

It's Adolf Hitler costume. Sieg Heil, sieg heil.

And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically.  I can take something as simple as this calculator  and... Trapper Keeper?

There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf.

Es ist Zeit für Rache! 

So then, we are all going to need some... more tea.

You're the crappiest band I have ever heard!

Eey!  It's not my triangle, it's Kyle's!

It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.

Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?

Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooo-ah. Uuuuu aaaaa.

I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.

Kenny!!!

Hey, be careful, asshole!

Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob.

Ahh!

Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.

Uuuh, school project.

Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?

It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all! 

So where the hell are we going to get a dead body?

What?

Are you telling me that I drove nine hours through butt-fucking nowhere to get a god-damned shirt?! Mom, Grandma's gone senile! It's time to stick her in a home!

Oh uh, Kyle has it. 

Yeah, I'm just hangin' out with Token. Did you know that if it wasn't for African-Americans, we wouldn't have Rock & Roll? So cool that we have a black President.  About time. 

What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.

I don't wanna.

Deeper.  Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome.

No Mexicans detected.  Huh, nothing.

Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up.  I'm psyched, Butters. I'm about to do somethin' big and  I'm psyched!

Up your ass with broken glass!

Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp.

No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!

I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!

Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you-

No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad.  So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye. 

Hi, mom. 

And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!

Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?

Oh I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah.

Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin! 

Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again!  But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas!

Well, I saved you all the chicken part. 

No on, come on, let's read it now!

Eewww!

We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!

Because... I'm a computer program.

Ugh yeah?! Well you all need to stay focused, Goddamnit!  If you let yourselves get distracted for even one minute, we're gonna be overrun with these jobless, no good-!

Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.

Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!

Right Butters.  These guys are so dumb, huh?

Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.

I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors. 

Hey mooom?

Fly back to the house, stupid!

Jesus was made of crackers?

He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and did what??

I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice.  We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties.  Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.

So you all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell!

I'm sorry  Why are you doing this?

Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!

The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say "You slept with my girlfriend," and I'll charge you into a head slap.

Why?

There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know.  The blood is washed neatly from our hands. 

Dude, that's not cool.

The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. 

Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck! 

Come on, Craig!

Look! There's an old refrigerator!  Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!

Oh, fine. How are you guys?

So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth. 

I want... your Jew gold! 

Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you.  Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show.

Here, talk to them, Butters.

Heh, I hate those things.

But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny.  Don't touch me, Kenny. 

You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying!

Come on! Come on!

Please, I have to talk to you all right now!

Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it.

There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead.

Wow, coo'..  Chocolate rules!

Butters, you have screwed me out of a prize for the last time! 

No, you didn't.

We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys!  Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down.

Yes ma'am. I'm gonna be on television, I'm gonna be on television.

Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?!

Do you think I'm stupid?! I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle!!  No! Noooooo! 

Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again!  You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!

Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it!  Well Butters?!

She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...

Not yet.

This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?!

Yehehehesss. Yehhhs! 

Noooo! 

Let's get to my house!! 

I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.

I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here , and all my friends are down here .

Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time.

You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it! 

No way, lady!

Oh no, not Towelie.

No, I just don't care. At all.

Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!

No!

Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this.

"Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings." These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this! 

Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls.

Kyle! 

Mom, seriously, it itches. It itches!

Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!

What do you mean? We're just... going to school.

GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! 

No way! You gave it to us-it's mine now!

Dude, this is hella cool.

Hey, dudes.

Dude, you know what? Japanese people really do not like whales.  Uh oh.

No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested.

Jews can't be Paladins.

Pooinshower. Madalen shine debaur. Huelar she mashartah me shur har.

All right, yay.

What?

It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away!

Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack.

Yeah yeah, we're listenin' to it! 

Please show your support for CartmanBrah brah right now by uh...

Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage! 

Yeah, he killed himself.

There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.

What, Kyle?! 

Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire.  I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!!  I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate.

No, dude, independent films are those black and white hippie movies. They're always about gay cowboys eating pudding.

Suck mah balls, Kyle! 

What what what?

Who is that??

Oh God, shut up!

NO KITTY, BAD KITTY!!!  Hahaha, you-hoo suck, dude.

How come you don't go to school?

You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN! 

You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!

Freeze, bitch!

Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs.

So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves.

Yeah, well, Dad's being a little pussy, Mom.

All right. It's a picture ...of me.

Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny! 

Yeah.

Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.

Hey you guys. This is just like that one movie, um, John Travolta and that, French chick were doing it, all summer long and went back to school and sang songs about "Greased Lightning."  You know, that movie where Sandra Dee thinks she's all prissy, and then they try and try to get an abortion, but she doesn't have all the-

No, you didn't.

Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar.

Hey, hey, what's going on?!  Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?!

Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose.  Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof.  "Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous!" 

Hey, I didn't get a gun.  Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam

Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters...

Told you guys.

Mobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die!

Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks?

Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.

Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast.

Erica.

I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!

Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.

Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize.

Yes, we know, Ms. Broflovski. It's so very interesting.

Butters.

Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Did you hear that?!  "In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss."  Oh my God, Butters...  we need Vagisil!

Killer weak, sweet!

KICK ASS!!

Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?

It's okay, man, come on.

You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?

Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak.

Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!

Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters.  Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?

CartmaaanBrah! CartmanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel, brahs.

Good.

Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do!

Is nice to the homeless
Californiania
Supercool to the homeless

You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to! 

Noooo...  Oh Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck I want pancakes.

Heh!  Oh, oh hey, Butters!  I wasn't expecting you so soon.

Huh?

Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?

Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.

Aw damn, man. Now I'm missing the new Barnaby Jones.

And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents. 

Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. 

They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?!

Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right?  Cool. 

O-kay! Let's see heuh. Haha! Um... Aw, damnit!  AAAAH! 

Hey dudes.

Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash.

Was it fun?

It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.

I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about "protectin' the earth" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!

Son of a bitch.

What are you doing, Kyle?

Officer Barbrady! 

D'you know what you are? You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say "That's the bad guy!" Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!

Aw yeah!

How is it offensive?

Yes, ma'am.

Oh!

...play stupid games.

Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights.

Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol. 

Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that.

She wasn't looking at you, buttlord, she was looking at me!

We found a Etheropian, can we keep him?

See? I told you guys it would work.

Oh my God... poor Billy Mays...

And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.

Ms. Lopez won't go to sleep!

Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?

Ohohoh, totally, brah! So sweet. Being in charge of stuff rules! CartmaaanBrah!

You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!

Oh, you mean this one? 

Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.

What girl is gonna see your balls?

Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! 

Sweet.

Kyle, Jesus Christ!

I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do!

Take that! 

I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be.
I don't give a crap 'bout whales so go and hug a tree.

Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.

What?!

Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.

Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?

Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now? 

What are you talkin' about, "quit"? Huh! I don't remember that.

The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards.

There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves.

You shut up,  butthole.

Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you? 

Heh, we apparently don't say 'side dishes' at the table, either.

Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?

It puts the lotion back in the basket!

Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't!

Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott.  Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA!  What a retard!  And now everyone saw it! 

Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!

Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!

But Cartman isn't letting up on him. 

I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange.  You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts.

No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, "Come Sail Away", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it.

It's raining frogggggsss!  Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs?

Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!

That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.

Moooommmm?

Hey douchebag, are you doing anything kewl?

...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.

YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?

Whaaat?!

That's right!

All right, we did it! 

Uh, everyone, tweet now if you wanna get rid of PewDiePie!

We're all gonna need a lot more calamine lotion.

Y taco.

Oh my God...

We've got about ten minutes before this entire country is up in flames! If you wanna live, you'd better step on the gas! Oh wait, is this a Tesla? Shit! Well press on the prissy pedal! We're gonna die!! 

We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape.

Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?!

Are you guys nuts?! After everything we've gone through!?

But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars?

Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to? 

Okay, that's it!  Screw you guys! I'm going home. 

What?

Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS! 

Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff.

Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.

Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men?

Well, let's go home, start eating that candy.

Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar!

Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?

Not with me, man.

Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you.

AWESOM-O understands.

Heh, c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon!

Wah!

Yes!

Cool! Can you get it for us?

How is this Kyle? This good? 

Mom, can you get me some Weight Gain 4000?

Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye.

You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of network are you running there in Canada?! Don't call me buddy! I'm not your buddy! 

That's right, and I...  Fake treasure?

Yay, XBox wins.

Haaa hahaha! You guys are hella stupid! I knew you would fall for that!

Eh-eh-eh-eh... 

Phew!

Three Crispy Yum Yums.

If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are...  Mitch Conner.

No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.

I'm going to kill you one day, Token.

Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris tomorrow?

Smell sequence initiated.

Butters?? Butters?? 

Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this.  We could just play with this. Screw video games, dude! Who fuckin' needs them?!

I'm ready, Steven Spielberg! 

You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! 

I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!

Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!

Seize her! 

Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?

Wugh, that's a long time to wait.

Sweet..!

No! He can't be dead!

"Pretty cool." So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show.

God-dammit, how long is this goin' to take?

Here, Butters!

Huh?! 

Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly.

What is this? The freakin' Flintstones?

That's right.

You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?

We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.

I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.

Oh, well, let me take this disk up to the Enterprise and see if Captain Kirk can decrypt it. 

When is this going to be on the air?

All right!

You guys! You guys!  Guess what?

Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.

What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  That's two to nothing, amigoo. 

Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.

That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!

Ah yes, herro prease.  We are Chinese peopull.

Oh, man!

Hooray!

That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!

I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces...  ...screw you Kyle.  Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny. 

Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature.

What did you say?

Jimmy Buffett?!

Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday... 

Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet.

So, it appears that you need me. Which is good, because... I need you, too.  Ringy-ding?

Can too!

You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.

No, Kenny, you can't look, I'm the foreman!

Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list.

Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?

You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.

Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up? 

What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!

Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!

And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, "Do you smell lemon grass?", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there.

Get a couple facing the other way, brah. 

But you have to come back. We hate our new scout leader.

Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next?  Whip it out, Butters. 

Like what?

Hello? I'm here, whoever you are. 

Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!

Naaaa!

Eeyy!

Old people gone mad!

Notice anything?  Watch. 

Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?

Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.

But if I'm not the most out-of-control teen, I might not win the prize.  Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe?

Nno Grandma.

You like bear mace, icehead?!

Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.

Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?

Noohoho! Peter Panda nooo!

Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions...

Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea.

No, you just have to save me. 

Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses.

I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop.

Hold on!  God, let a man crap!

Well, you can tell Kyle that he's a dirty goddam son of a bitch!!

You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!

Ey! Don't call me fat, Token!

What the hell is that thing?

I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now! 

Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay! 

Uh oh, 5:30, time to pray.  Allah, Allah, m'heh

Yeah.  This one's yours, Stan. This one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters... 

Really?  Hey, there's a frozen guy down there.

Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.

Well ma'am, I have some exciting news.  We would like your child to play for the Crack Baby Athletic Association. 

No...more...coffee. Blech. 

Kewl!

What are you guys doing?

Blululululululuh. I am the deadly Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. I am very scary... And dangerous!

Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!

Guys? Guys!  Oh it's true! You all did survive!

Yeah, well, that why they call is Asspen. 

...Gay.

Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!

Jesus Christ!

Oh. Did I hurt his little feelings? 

Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick from Hunger Games' butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass!

What?!  Son of a bitch!

Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR.

Hey you guys, when I'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want.

One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message!  Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world!  Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!

Hi there, folks! This is a heck of a storm out now! Thought maybe you could use some provisions.  There's some candles and food in there. It ain't much, but it should get you through the night. Take care, folks. I've got other houses to get to. 

What? Move aside, move aside! 

Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?

You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than "shit", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob. 

All right, I'm back.

Go to MySpace.  See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.

Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said "shit" on television!

There's one problem.  You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything.

What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play!

C'mon. Give me Pengin!

Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser  so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5.

But  Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man.

My God...

Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?

Oh, Jesus, not this thing again.

I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget?

Doctor, can you tell me exactly how stem cells work?

All right, Butters, you leave me no choice. 

Mr. Garrison??

Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. 

No no! He's my son! I adopted him.

Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle!

Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls bathroom a long time ago.

Oink oink oink.

God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps?

And girl you know you're cool, you're good, you're so much nicer, girl
You're good, You're gonna be--

How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?

Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors.

Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier. 

Get online. I need you to check something for me.

Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time?

No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay! 

Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.

You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in!  Please.

The present.

Oh, you didn't get a special Chinpokomon game controller. T-heh heh heh heh. Jehesus C-hrist! 

You can't be the tough one, you're Jewish!

Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them.

Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle!

Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.

Then eat your puke.

What what what?

Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face.

No no, no no, nono no!Nonono, no no!

Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!

Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!

There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! 

Uh...

What's hardcore and exciting about City shrimp? 

No, it was Kenny!

That's 'cause I was having these... bogus nightmares.

I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to water!

All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?!  Oh, hold on.  Aah, let's see... that one.  Stupid fraud!  Good riddance to YOU! 

Yeah, come on! Here we go!

What?! That's ridiculous!

You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts.  Kyle, Kyle no! 

Yeah. 

It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!

LALALALALALALALA!

Hey.

I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!

Won't be long, Kyle. 

Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!

Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew!

Well, let's just play our game, then.

I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!

Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!

Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it.

I'm gonna miss him.  I'm gonna miss Chef and I...and I don't know how to tell him! 

Nah. Come on, guys. Let's go look for crocodi-iles.

Oh my God. I crapped my pants.  You guys, I crapped my pants!  Heheh. You guys! You guys, check it out!

Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you  it's not a joke.

Well, I guess you're screwed, then. 

Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk?

KISS MY ASS!!!  Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak.

All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this "Women Who Run With The Wolves" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers.

That's awesome, Butters.  Keep making your way down the hallway. Your vital signs are looking good. What do you see now? 

Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold!

Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle!

What?

Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today.

Shunkarah puntaur lah-turi.

Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!

Then how does he know our names?

Tell us about it!

What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him?

The?!

True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours.  Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors.

No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn.  No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!

All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.

I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
I'll be there, Kyle
I swear  like a shadow that's by your side
Kyle, swear to God I'll be there.
For better or worse , till death do us part 
I'll love you with  every gay beat of my heart!

Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches.

Got it! 

How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippy!

You see I told you guys!  What's the use? It just, it's hopeless! 

So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it!  Our first album cover. 
Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go.
My heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that door.
I promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights.

Uh, it's nice to meet you, Kyle. I can certainly tell you're a relative of my good friend Kyle here. 

What's so funny?

He walks-uh!

You're dead, Stan.

Yeah! Wait-what?

I'm first, I'm first! 

It's Monday?

Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me!  Now hand it over!

I was just down in the SPC kickin' it with some G's on the Westsa-eed-eh.

Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.

Oh, you're going down, Elin!

I don't wanna take care of Cousin Elvin!

Chuh!  Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes!

Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!

A picture of your mom's boobs?

Haha.

Looks like I've come to the right place.

It's completely immature! 

That sonofabitch!

Now, are you a team player or not?!

Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend. 

There, that's better.

Yes! Yes, we can record an album next week! Sure we can write ten songs! We'll start tonight!!  We're gonna be rich!

I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30.

Hey Stan.  Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?!

I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.

Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!

Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?!  Fine! I'll do it by myself!

Forty bucks?

Thirty was hard enough.

Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison! 

Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants.  Ow!

We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come! 

That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid.  Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too.  I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?

Hehe, I broke the dam. Hehe.

Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo. 

Oh goddamnit, nobody's doing anything kewl!  I'm so bored! Everything is so stupid!

Aw- Aw- AWESOM-O is coming. 

No it isn't.

What?!

Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now.  So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?

You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!! 

Okay. See you in a while.

Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha...

Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.

They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remedy. But behind closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Coochie, wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of cough medicine abuse.

But mom, I need it for tomorrow.

He crapped his pants today during social studies! He had to go to the nurse's office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans! 

My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!

Yeah.

Hmmm. I wonder what I should do with my triangle, now that it is mmyy triangle.

No, it was just a dream,  my mom said so.

There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real.  Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah.  Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real?  I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?

That dog is a gay homosexual.

I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!

You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.

Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. 

What?? Eh...  hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free!

And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?

Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?

Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around.

Hey Token? How are you doing?

Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?!

Why can't societies just live in peace?

What?

Totally. 

Oh, well, I'll just take that, then.  And what about this? Is this one of your favorites?

This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.

Red Power!

Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything.

Chef! Chef!

Oh, man, this sucks.

Fuck you Bebe! Fuck you bitch!

Ha!  Serves you right, assholes! 

Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!

Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually.  Um, Butters, could you get that?

You guys, get over here!

Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? 

Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time.

They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket and he has the coolest dad in the world! 

Kyle, hurry! 

Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true.

My heart says ye-es (ye-es ye-es) but my vajayjay says no-o

Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-

Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone!

It is really sweet.

Yeah. 

Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!

Nononono! Me h'myah , you guys myah!  — maybe a little mo down, down in hyah.  SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME. 

Holy crap! 

Oh very funny, Kyle!

Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop. 

Okay, except maybe for that one time.

God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!

Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom.

Oh, please. Bradying is to 2000 and lame.

Ey! You can't do that! Ey!

Yeah, my ass is killing me.

I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said "No." I owe you an apology and, I mean it.

Uh, yes, we'd like one order of the City Beef.

I know. Ah I know you don't like me back. I ju- Yeah, you know, the- this was stupid, I'm sorry. Will you just take a cupcake?  Oh, don't take the cupc- I, I'm sorry. I, I'm sorry I wasted your time. 

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 

They look so delicious. 

O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?

Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!

If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.

HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash!

They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! 

Yeah, it's coming from up there.

Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow!

Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow. 

Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all!

Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it! 

Thank you, thank you.  The ramp ready?

Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him.

It's cool man, it's cool. 

Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right?

Aww, screw you guys anyway!

Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.

I'm gonna!

Haduqaduqaduqa.  Huqadukadukadukaduuu. 

Man, you guys are hella stupid! If I had money, I wouldn't give it to you assholes!

Wing? Here, Wing!

Yeah? 

Kenny!  I deserve to be on TV.

When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-

Okay Kyle.

You're a chick, dude.

Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.

Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.

What's a Chewbacca defense?

Butters, calm down, alright?

He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time.

Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh.

Hey, ah, Nichole, right?

Hello.

No, that was a jakovasaur. It's okay to come in. 

You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!

Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?

Jeh-

Hey Craig. Goin' on? Token! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-

Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday.
I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face!

Eeeh!  

Fucking bitch...

Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare?

Thirty-three aborted fetuses.  Oh yes.

Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.

It's a cool island song.

Wu-we don't really "need" the ticket stub, do we?

How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle!  Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please. 

C'mon.

Dude!!  How did he get past the fence, Craig?!

Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew!

We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own.

Oh weak, bros, so weak!

You, you will?

Uncle Stinky, can you drive us to the mall?

Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines!

Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!

Thaaat's ri-ight.

For he is LordLord, Lord, LordRight here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?!

Ye-heah!

Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy.  Mm-yummy you guys!  Yuppitibut, that's all, folks! 

So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us.  Hooray.  Oh oh. Hold still, Kenny. 

It's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squah-o-lantern, Kenny?! That's hella stupid!

What's that noise? 

Token, Token, got a question for you:  Token, do you like fishsticks?

Alright lads, guess we'll have to settle with this meager ship. Two of you sit aft and two of you sit in the front.

Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?

Okay, why?

No, go ahead. I'm dry.

BEEFCAKE!

'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl. 

Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it!

Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years.  Look! There's a library! A-and a temple! And a- who-?  Oh. They think I'm God.  Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?!  I am god of the sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!!  Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!

So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama.

City of Venice
Right by Matt's house
You can chill if you're homeless.

How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal!

Man, your family sucks ass, Kenny. Whoever heard of frozen waffles for dinner?

Eech.  Wait a minute! No, you wouldn't!

I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks!

Aaaaaa aaaaaa ooagh!

Yeah! Go! 

Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing.

No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here.

You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow.

Ey! 

Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.

Those weren't our dick sizes?

I have to think about... planes dropping bombs, and dump trucks, and self-serve ice cream...  Oh, that did it.

I just finished planning a brilliant  li'l scheme  that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars. 

Oooo, trippy...

...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes.

Dude. NOW this is getting weird!

Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.

Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door!

What dude?

That sucks, dude.

Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.

Hey, fuck you, Kyle!

I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT! 

It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. 

The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!

What?! Who the hell did that to my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance?!

Nice.

Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now. 

Waiwait, keep- you're fine.  Oh man, whoa!

Shh! Help me call it out, Butters.

And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. 

One of them is in the back!

Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th-

You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?

And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too.

It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.

Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir.

Get outta the way! Move it!

Are you okay?

What's the matter, Kyle?

Screw you, triangle thief!

Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse!

Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.

Oh! Son of a bitch!

Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.

I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?!  Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow. 

Mmm, one more time, Kyle.

Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.  Fat Jew! Jew bitch!

How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.

Your sister beat you up again, huh?

He's playing an enchantment.

Mom! MOOOM! Mom!  Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!

Uncle Howard, what are you doing here?!

Fuck 'em!

Cartman SMASH! 

You're an art teacher!

Wha?  What are they?

Hm. I don't really see the irony in that, Kyle. 

Ay! Check it out!  Damn it!

Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.

Okay, it's clear. 

Uh oh, we're losin' him.

Okay, anyways. Now enough small talk, lads! It's time for us to start rapin' and plunderin'!

Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again.  Friends, our school is dying and you know it. You feel it. You're like, you're like me; you wanna change it. But ohhh no, Wendy Testaburger's not gonna let that happen! This is not the school we grew up in, and ...and I don't know if we can get it back.  So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our school president ...wants to kill Smurfs.

All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. 

Oh no you don't! Finders Keepers!

Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times.

I'm not Bruce Vilanch!

Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested.  Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!

No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it.  Sweeeeeeeeeet!

Nothing, Butters. Right, guys?!

Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys! 

Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!

They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously.

Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh. 

It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.

Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?

Switching to secondary fuel line.  What's that?

Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical!  Oh!

Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him.

Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.

All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick.

Uh yes, I'm sure I can convince him to come on the show.  There will of course be a prize involved?  Great. I'll call you back in an hour.  No, thank you.  YES!

All right, come on! 

Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache.

Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs?

Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip.

No! I found it, he stole it!

Mmmm, noooo, Because I don't want to. Aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard. But hey, from one Redskin to another, go fuck yourself. 

Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.

No, I'm just gonna go- 

What??

You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.

Hey, you're gonna miss it Kenny.

Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?

Jakov, I want you to meet my friends.

Dr. Shafley?

Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around. 

Hey look! An infidel! 

What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!

We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. 

All of us?

Here, Kyle. 

Uh-huh.

All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool!  That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick!  Go ahead, Kyle.

And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you, and some peanuts. 

That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.

Now, just yell "Put the lotion in the fucking basket!"

Yes ma'am.

I told you this game was sweet, dude.

I will

There is a crisis in America. and we have to save our living rooms. Our living rooms are dying.

Why the hell not?!

If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief!  Oh, yay! 

Whoa, awesome!

Well Kyle, we'd better get going.

All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we're go to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle.

What? This is cool.

You guys, I have to get home.

Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I-  He's so fucking stupid.  But I'm sure they will soon.

You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen? 

Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon frère!

What the hell are you guys doing?!

Oh, boy!  Superbitch is at it again!

Yeah?

No!

Oh, Jesus.

Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!

Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says "We need to talk" you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude.

So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!

Yeah, I know dude. I'm telling you, it was the worst pain in my entire life.

Token.  Dude, dude. Dude.

How's it going? 

No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.

Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros!

Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington

Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!

Wait, wait wait wait. This doesn't make sense. This whole thing doesn't make any sense. I must be-

Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that?

I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.

Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John. 

Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait!

You're my dad, Chef. Chief Running Water said - you got together with my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance.

HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH!

See ya, Uncle Howard.  Thanks for being such a great role model for me.  Piece of crap.

Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.

Oh, Mom, for Pete's sake! 

He is black.

Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.

Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.

Oh no!  Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up?

Girls volleyball?  Uhhh, sorry, we're actually busy.

For oth-er...  Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later?

Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one!

Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Foundig Fathers!

Yes. A little too quiet.

You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian.

Kyle, suck my balls. 

You okay, Jenny?

The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me,  which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.

Come on, rice picker!

What? A federal offense?

Why don't you mind your own business?!

Your Honor, my lawyer is just parking the car. He should be here any second.

Sir, step out of the car.

Ee-goddammit!

Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.

Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our team, who totally sucks ass.

Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people.

Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again.  We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself?

Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it!

There's bound to be some crocs up here. I'll use my croc call and try to bring 'em out. Brigeghus, brigeghus! Brig-!

My father...

What the hell are you guys doing?!

Am I sure?? Look at this place!

Daddy?

Psst Butters. Butters!  At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.

What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.

Oh, man, look at that one!  It looks delicious

So how do boy bands use that?

That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass!  I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over!

Tommy said you have some KFC.

WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

Those sons of bitches!

What?!

All right you guys, I know what we have to do.  We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker.

She's got Colonel!

Who's there?!  Lock that door behind you, Token.  Black people live here! 

Yeah, you suck, dude!

They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.

All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!

Scanning for Mexicans.  Oh!  We've got a Mexican! 

Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?

I'm sorry.

Uh, whatever!

I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right?

Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we? 

Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you.

Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice. 

Sorry guys, I gotta go. The world needs CartmanBrah. 

This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright.

Awww, sweet!  No way, this is so tits!

Devil be  gone-uh!

Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.

Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny! 

Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls! 

Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers?

Bring it, bring it! 

One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters!  Don't come any closer! We have information that that we will only trust with the President of the United States!

Next!

Oh, right. Why should we care?  Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, "It's not your problem." But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, "You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!"  Now who's with me?!! 

Agh--! 

You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!

Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve?

What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?

Who's this asshole?

Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.

Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door!

Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares! 

Al-righty then. Let's get to my presents, shall we?

No! No, he has to suck my balls!  NO! KYYYYLE! 

Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks?

Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people!

It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!

What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee.

Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself.  That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool.

I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!

Stan, knock it off!

No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick!  ...Oh Jesus Christ.

Heyh! They have a zoo there!

What?! What did you say?!

Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!  Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!

Cool.  Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle!  Who are you?

Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton? 

I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  You think about it. 

Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?

I'm not talking to him, because he's a dirty thief.

What the hell just happened?

Somebody help us! 

I know how.

We can't understand you, asshole! 

God damn it, why is it every time we try to have a relaxing day a bunch of asshole on their Harley motorcycles show up?! 

All right!

What is it?

It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?

Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? 

Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody.

I am a little piggy. Ey!  That does it! Mom!

California Supercool to the homeless

But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here.

Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives.  Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow!

Yeah, when you die, your jowels release and crap comes flying out your ass. 

Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters.

I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.

Your dad's drone.

There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!

Woohoo!!! 

See? You're scared. Because you know if you say it a third time, he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face. 

We had a deal, Kyle!

You seen this woman, brah?  She's staying here!

You know God damned well what!

Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.

Atta boy Butters!

I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato!

Great, just sign right here, please.  Hi. Havin' an abortion today?  Great.  Listen, if you'd like to sell your abortion for research I'm offering uh, seventy-five dollars. Help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there.  And you sign right here.  Uh excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus? 

Oh, shut up guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working.

I told you, Butters. 

Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!

I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?

That's more like it.

I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.

They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?

Alright, kewl.

We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.

Hello hello, are you still there?

I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months.

Could you turn it up?

Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-

It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.

Butters. Butters.

No you're not.

I'm not fat! I just haven't grown into my body yet, skinny bitch!

Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia.

Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several.

Cripple fight! 

Oh come on, you guys. We still have plenty of money left over.

I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus.

We should have never listened to you, Kyle.

Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead!  Ow!

My case worker?  Oh, not this guy!

It's a bitch, ain't it?

I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!

Kyle?

I don't think it's funny, Kyle.

Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey.

There's Kenny commenting on Call of Duty. Kenny! Kenny! SPEAK UP!! SPEAK THROUGH THE HOOD KENNY!

Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back. 

Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it.

We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.

Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?

Calm down, Clyde. Everything's gonna be okay!

I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih--

Cat pee? 

Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens.  No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus.  Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.

Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish?  Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow! 

Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like Animaniacs?

Do you think I'm an idiot?

Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven.

Shhh. Be quite, you guys!  Hello, is this Maury Povish?  Oh, well who the hell are you?  Oh. Well I'm calling about your ad for freaks?  Ye-right, people with disabilities?  Yeah, I have a friend; he has a deformity; I think he'd be perfect for your show.  Great!  Hih-his condition?  Uh, he has a condition called "chinballalitis."  Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin.  Shut uh- shut up you guys.  Yes.  Yes, of course he's very upset about it.  Yes, he cries all the time.  Miserable, uh huh.  You wha- Really?

You're-you're a worm. That's that's cool, that's cool.

Okay. No first graders around. I can swim to the deep end.  Yeah... I can do it. I can do it. I can-- I'm gonna make it. 

Ooohh, I love whole new levels! This is gonna be so totally awesome! CartmaaanBrah!

Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal. 

I put a lot of Arby's horsey sauce on those.

Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?

If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained?

Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew! 

No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.

What??  Greeley?

No Sally Struthers, you gimme that cake!

He-hey, that's my money!

Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!

Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom! 

God these guys are such dorks!

No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene!

...What did you say?

All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble?

Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!

My name isn't Eric Cartman, it's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it?

All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff.

Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.

Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!

Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad.

Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  Time in!  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!

They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah.

What will become of the endeavoring American family?"

Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef.

How are we doing on those patties, Jew?

Oh good, you got the crappy kidney.

Oh, uh that's pretty cool.

Dude, check it out: for picture day, Kenny got into his parka backwards, so that his ass shows through his hood. Look! . Kenny, Kenny, over here! 

I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!

Butters.  You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?

Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies.

What!

It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.

You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!

Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.

Wweell, I might have been over at the Cheesy Poofs call-back, winning regional championship! 

I got your back, soldier.

Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.

Ugh. UGHuh.  I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old! 

Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime!  Jesus Christ!  Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn!

Get it!  Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive! 

Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it. 
Day is never finished, Massa got me working... Oh, look, I found another one  Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle! 

I'm trying.

Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make "quadruple stuffs."

Uncle Howard!

Yeah, well you got skinny arms!  'Scuse me. Move it.

Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!

We be headin' to Somaaliaa. By way of Miami to Cairo. And take care o' you put us in an exit row, you land lubber!

Heheh, yeah.

Fruttar sheshar.  What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck!  There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there!  Do you see them?

Oh, God-damnit you guys.

But mom, me and Artemus Clyde Frog still have to do our love scene with Salma Ha-yek.

Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.

Just go, Butters. We're running out of time.

I'm all wet! Sweet!

That's killer.

Weight Gain 4000, it's helping me bulk up.

Fuckin' butthole!

What did I tell you, Butters? This is the good life, huh?  What's going on?

No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie.

Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers.

We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!

That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off.

Oh come on!

Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me.

Wake up, you son of a bitch!

We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?

I wasn't making fun of anybody.

I'm gonna get her, Kitty! Mark my words!!  SHUT THE HELL UP, KITTY!! 

Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated.

Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! 

Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want!

I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF.

And girl, you know that you're the only girl for me, girl
Girl, you're the girl of my fantasy
You're my girl, you're my girl

I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment!

Eee-ee-ee-ee! 

This is my regional championship certificate! Do you like it?  Hey, where is your regional champsionship 'tificate, Clyde? Oh, you don't have one?  Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno?  Apparently, only I do.

Could I see that again? That was cool.

This is going to be hard to understand, Butters,  but, you've become trapped in a simulation. None of this...  is real.

Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny?  Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor.

Come on, man, this isn't funny!  I need my fix! 

Well, there's everything, Butters.  I've made everything right.

But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay. 

Hands?! Let me see those hands!

Thanks, asshole.

Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les Misérables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks.

You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?

Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend.

Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now.

What? Don't you have dodgeball in France?

that's why they're lame.

Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday.  G-goodbye!  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.

Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!

U-hi think that's a sweet idea!

I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?

...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day...  Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to...  God-damnit!  Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today! 

"An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen." See? That means crap your pants. "The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb." What does that mean?

So how long until we can joke about it?

Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked.

Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now.

Just, could I talk to you, real quick?  What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Token?

That's not funny! Jesus Christ!

-ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille 
Four hungry children and a-

Heh. Hey, what what's going on?

Yes!

You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!

Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be.

Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.

Oy! Bebebebebebebe.

Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!

But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault!

You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said.

Oh, I don't know, I guess I'll take that ring there.

Really?

I reeached these keeeds.

Family?

Now we're talkin'! 

Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!

He said it was okay.

I don't know! Why would you?!

It's a Sri Lanka frog!

Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.

All I know is, I got this sweet digital watch and these cool shoes; I'm telling you guys, suing people kicks ass!

Yesss!

No I don't remember that!

I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.

He's faaahn.

Screw you! 

And my house is being fumigated!

God, you know what, that's so true? Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.

Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before.

Stand my ground?

Yeah, I think that'll be nice.

Just like Jared.

What?! 

No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie! Bad Kitty--!  Eh, 'scuse me, Kitty.

You guys wanna p-play outside or something? 

Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here! 

You're all just saying that to make me feel better.

Over the meadow and through the woods...

God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys?

God damnit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip. 

Are you still trying to give a semen sample?

Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?! 

What new Elmo doll?

It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.

Everyone, stop! Please! 

Hard to port, lads!

Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there were... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.

Aw Goddamnit!

Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world.

We set course tomorrow! I purchased everyone's ticket online using me mother's credit card!

Oh. I don't know, Clyde Frog. I just am.

Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too.

Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!

We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.

Yes, right here. I went to Amazon to see if they had Grand Theft Auto V, and it says, "you might also be interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek." I'm totally interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek! How did they know that unless the government is keepin' tabs on mw?!  This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to go hard core!

Uh oh.

Oh, you know, this and that.

You came for us!

Let's go get him! 

All right, you ready?  All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go. 

Santa!

Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool.  It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.

What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.

Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?

Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker.

How many students is that?

Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do.

Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!

What?

I'm Eric Cartman!

Look at that guy. He's like 40, but he's got a Justin Bieber haircut.

You guys, it's just me.

'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.

Oh really? Sweet.

Ohhh.

That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that.

I knew they would!

Yeah, so how's it look?

Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.

You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!

Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez.

Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me! 

No way.

The Incredible...

Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!

What- what's up?  What what's up?  Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you.

...No.  Ey! Euuugh.

Nothing..!

Jew! 

He's such a douchebag.

Who's joking? 

Just do what you were sent to do, dickface! 

Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!

Somebody's been in my room!  Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!

Don't call me fat! Now, you guys are not supposed to be in heuh!  You get out now and respect my authoritah!  Ow! 

This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter.

I'm volunteering my time, Kyle.

Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyoncé.

A person. 

No! Don't!  AAAAAA! AAAAADUH!

Yes!

Well, so can we play here?

What are you doing?!  You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug!  The town is in serious danger! 

Do you wanna play rough?! Okay!  Take this! 

Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?

Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it.

Butters!

Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven.  So I guess it's cool. 

Open.  Bellog. 

Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo.

You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies! 

No need. I have one for you right here. 

The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do!

Shut up, Scott Malkinson. "I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes."

Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag.

Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?!

The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih! 

Well, because yesterday I got my period. 

Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy!

I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!

Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. 

Bad! That's a bad snay-ah! 

Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!

Ahhh, good. A hostage will bring a fine ransom.  Well well well well well!

Alright Jimmy, see ya. 

Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week.

Are we sure about this? We'll never know the future.

Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! 

Hör zu, diese ganze Dinge ist ein Fehler. 

A little penis-biting, perhaps?

Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that? 

Ogh! God-damnit..!

...Kenny?  Kenny?!

Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!

Clyde?!  The fuck are you doin'?! You just let a Mexican through!

No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson!  All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!

Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go.

Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel? 

No! Noooooo! No, God, Nooo!

Hooray!

That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!

Polly Prissypants! Rumpertumskin!  Jesus Christ! 

They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead. 

No, Fonics Monkey!  No, Fonics Monkey, that's a bad Fonics Monkey! 

Muh-Mom, I've only just heard. They're making Chinpokomon dolls, mom. You can collect them all. You can collect them all, Mother; quick, come on. Let's go to the toy store.

Forget it! Just forget it! 

Okay, you're on, Jew! 

It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. 

Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir! 

Then you did sleep with my mom?

Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five.  How about five bucks?

See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally! 

That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.

No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that!

And stop your bitchin'!

Yes! I did it!  I jumped over the homeless!  Yes!

Live together!

What if I did, Kyle?

No kitty! That's a bad kitty! 

Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. 

WAY worse!

Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean. I'm gonna have to smack it in the face. 

You ready?  Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say,  "Shit."

Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime.

Token, calm down.

It's Sally Struthers!

Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about video games, but now I'm branching out into talking about people talking about music and the arts as well.

I don't idolize you anymore, asshole! 

There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?

That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways. 

No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.

The city isn't what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went to crap. It's like... everyone's sense of morals just... disappeared. Bad economy made things worse.  The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down.  Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things.  He didn't.  As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs protection.  There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage.  To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man.  I'm the hero this town needs. I am...  the Coon!  As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact. 

All right. You go find chicks, Kenny.

You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you! 

What??

Will somebody take those books away from him?

Shh shh shh shh Butters Butters.  You you like putting fishsticks in your mouth?

The Provider awakes!

This is for your own good, Brother Kyle.

You will? Wow, you guys are the best! Thank you guys!

Let's go! 

Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master!

Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?

...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer.

Where did the Confederates go, son?

Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.

'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!

Sweet.

It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!

All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?

You got the money?  Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point.

Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.

Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here.  Look that way, make sure the cashier doesn't see me.  Is anybody coming?

Selling T-shirts kicks ass!

You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes.

The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?!

I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.

Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do.  By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are...  extra vinegary...

Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?

Go, Kenny!

Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking topical and revamping old Catholic jokes!

Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?

Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming.  I know that you are all deeply troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman once and for all!  Yes, Clyde!

What the hell? Can't find the server?  Kickstarter.com!  Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth!

Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong?

Uhhh, hmmm. What?

All right all right, here's ten dollars! 

You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up.

Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!

I'm not fat, I have a different life choice.

Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures.

I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now!

See? He's an asshole. Fuck him.

Check.

Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that your parents think that you're in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're both screwed! 

I tried getting one last week!

Got something to say Kyle?! 

Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered.

Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home. 

Oh, biiitch.  Your—mom—is--a--bi-bi-bii-biittchh.

That's ri-aayy.

Wait what?

Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, "Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?" "Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman."  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!

Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.

Hey, let go of him! 

Butters?

The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well.

Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers.  If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands.

Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them.

You what?!

No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being "mys-teriously" arrested, huh?! 

Maaaa. Mah mah mh.  Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days?  In those days? In those days? In those days?

Alright, fine! Here!  Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this! 

Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle.

Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!

...Uh oh.

In court?

What a dork!

Oh, shit, dude!

AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! Rumpertumskin!! RUMPER  Rumpertumskin... WHY? Why did you do this??

That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.

Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding me?

If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom. 

Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!

Look: you can stay over nyah , but I'm going over nyah. 

Ogh! Now I'm gonna kick my friend Kyle in the beanbag and see what happens, by crikey!

And why did the guys send you, Kyle?

Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights!  Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! 

You'll just have to wait and see.

Agreed.

My consciences just caught up with me.

But they say I can't be in their club!!

It it done?! It is all ready?! Alright alright, move aside everybody, move aside please. I gotta go.  Oh! Ahm. This is gonna be so awesome.  Aha! Lock! Privacy. Oh, this is gonna feel so good!  Perfect.  Yeah, you're gonna take it. You're all alone now, toilet. Nobody can hear you scream. Yeah, you're gonna open wide.  You're gonna TAKE your punishment! That's right! Get ready!  Oh my God, this is so awesome you guys! It's just like at home!

You can't do that!

Yeah!

Orange who?

You can't just "hit" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it!  Shut you butthole, or I'll kick your ass, you fuckin' drum!!  That's how you rock, dude.

What are you guys doing?

Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! 

Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!

So then I can say, "What are you, a gay fish?"

Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents.

We were talking about Wales the country.

Eh, no, that, that was just a dream. And I'm not fat, I'm big boned!

I don't know, but it sounds pretty sweet.

Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?

Do you have them or not?

Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination work to do! 

You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.

Ey, get off of him, you fuckin' nutsack!

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

Oh, dude, oh.

Fucking gross!

Uh, sure!

Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!

Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?

I'll certainly do my best.  Ow.

It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!

Jimmy told me about this game.

Oh boy.

Yeah.

Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck.

We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.

Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts.

Stan, what's a queef?

Eh! 

This picture I like to call "The Pierre". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha.  And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth.  I call this picture "The Sleeping Menstrual".  This one, I call "Hot Fudge Mondae".  I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.

Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. 

How do I reeeach these keeeeds?!  Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, "Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat." You know what happened?  They lost.  Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives.

Oh, for Christ's sake!

Eh. You're making me sick, dude.

Wait, we need Ben-Gay. 

But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse!

He's lying, dude. Hit X

And I'm Rick Cartman.

You can do it, Fonzie.

Whoa, how did I do that? 

You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me.

All right, cool, brah. Go with Christ. 

Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it.

Sister Anne is a blasphemer!

You are making it up. 

Put them in my laptop! 

I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet! 

Weh hunh hrhrh hrh huh-right! Like I'm some hippie Indian.  You know what I'm sayin' G? Check you later-I'm gonna go chill with mide-my dad. 

All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and get super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?! 

Really? 

Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. 

Thank you all for coming. Prince Token, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormick . Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At Scott Malkinson's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves.

Hmm.  I can't.  I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. 

Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.

Oh yeah, okay.

I'm not fat, I'm big-boned. Ech.

I did. I'm the Rad Russian.  I come from Russian to crush your puny capitalist heads!

Craig, could I talk to you real quick?  Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater.

Uh, yeah, sure sure.

Ee-yes, by doing that,  and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!

That's niiice, Peter Panda.

Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.

You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you.

Oh, god dammit!

You said Pete Melman couldn't kill himself! By making Jenny Simon crap her pants worse than Pete, I've made her the number one story on Eavesdropper! 

Snow igloos kick ass. 

KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMIDS!

Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat.

Well, Token's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know.

Ah, nice. Come on, mateys! 

Let's see... Matthew 15:11. "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man." That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting. 

Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.

Hey!

You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O.

Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go.

Dammit! Can't this thing go any faster?! 

Get out of here, asshole!

YES I AM!! 

We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us.

Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house. 

Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny!

What?! Aw, God damn it!  Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha.

Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?!  Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?!  I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!

What the hell are you assholes doing here?!

Look like ice cream to me.

Revenge is so very, very sweet.

Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge.

They're not people, they're HIPPIES!

Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.

...Eh the... Founding who? 

Thank you, Kyle.

This TV is great, Chef.

No! No. Don't.

Okay, ready Kenny?

Ey! I need to use the phone!

Oh God...  Okay, how long now?

Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-

Don't be jealous, guys.  This doesn't mean we can't still hang out.  It just means that I matured faster than you.  You'll get your pubes guys, someday.

And a one, and a two, and a- 

Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it.

Uh what?

Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics.  Bull's eye!

Butters, shut the hell up! 

That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents?  Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We're not the ones bombing them now, we're- we're just kids.  There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault.

Oh it's over, it's finally over! 

You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon.

So that's what this has all been about?

No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!

...Shit, I gotta find Butters! 

Butters.

You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle? 

Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.

Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this!  Oh my God, you guys, seriously!  Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich!  Aren't you stoked?!

Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take.

Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey.  Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr.

Wake up, Kyle. 

Dude, what are you doing?

Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money.

Oh, come on! Japanese girls do it. 

Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh! 

Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing.

Step out of the car, please, sir.

Oh no! Oh the humanity!

No way dude.

Aw man, that's too bad, Token. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop! 

Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.

Boy band.

Yeah, I like fishsticks.

That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.

Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?

Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs. 

Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog

Oh Jesus, what now?! 

Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!

This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.  Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers. 

CartmaaanBrah!

Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.

Kyle, what are you doing?

Shhh, Kenny...  Old Ken is taking it especially hard. He's always loved dolphins so much that he-  Yeah yeah but, but keep it in a two-shot, though.  Yeah, keep it there.  He's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything.

Oh, weak, dude!

Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!

You do?

Neither did we.

Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now.  And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy. Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS? 

Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.

Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left.

Attention! Attention please!  This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it!  Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands!  Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle. 

Poopin' outside,
Makin' self-serve ice cream
For my friends
Specially Kenny.
Hey, Kenny, Can I borrow one of your gloves?

How could you know anything about who my family is?

Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends.  And he's had a profile for more than six months.

Butters, what's the problem?

No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time!

Uhh nuh-nothing...

I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do!

...Lame.

No, mine. M'yah!  Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha  bluh oh, ha-ow! 

Uh, what's the question again?

Break my Xbox and you'll never know.

The fuck is this?!

Butters.

Hah, I love you guys.

No hey ut what, what I meant to say was "asslicker cumballs." And uhh,  I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! 

...Ice cream?

Yeah! I'll be a Jew too.

Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean!

Yeah, he's excited.

Right. What are we playing again?

Please, you guys, I don't know what to do!

"I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes."

Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS!

Hucky-sucky five dollar.

Honestly, I wouldn't really care.

What?

It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be soo stoked. It's the best surprise ever!

Kyle's makin' mudpies; you guys want one? 

You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?

And-uhh who's, who's in here with you?

Dude, relax.

O-hoo, what's that, Kyle?

What's this?

Hey, screw you.

Jesus, we're too late.

We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room. 

Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense.

And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie.

I'm trying to have a flashback.

Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here? 

"My arms hurt." Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business! 

What?

Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee

What's your problem, kid?!

City of Santa Monica
Lots of rich people
giving change to the homeless

Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now! 

Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita. 

By who? Goddammit Garrison, who is my father?

You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.

And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you. 

What is the Great Question?

Kenny! Kenny! kenny...

Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for...

Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the balls!  Kyle!  Quit it, Kyle. Give it up, Kyle!  Okay... Okay! Okay okay!  You win! You win. I give up.  Hahaha! I had my fingers crossed. 

Tango tango tango! We've got it! Let's get it to the containment center! Go! 

Ah, son of a bitch!

This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?

I'll I'll call you back, Abe. 

Buh, alright.  eh, Butters?

Oh, it's about freakin' time you showed up! You don't want me, you want that impostor Cartman! Come on, I'll show you. 

No they don't, you jealous weakling!

Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy.

Two.

O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! 

Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!

What the fuck is this?!

Huh. Ohmigod! Huh.

God! She didn't take this long to die.

It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that last for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen. 

Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.

Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle.

Toshiba Handibook??

What?! Hey, that's mine!

I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics.  Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety.

Detention! That's it! 

You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son.  You just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules. I won't let you dominate my life anymore!  Goodbye, Mother. 

Mom, mom! You wanna see what I want for Christmas?

Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again.

Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny.

Yeah.

Don't you touch him! Leave him alone!  Peter Panda!

The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you? 

No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I  What happened?!

Yeah, but I was like "I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle." In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?

Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service.

We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa! 

Alright, your turn Craig.

Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan...

God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park.

Wait a minute! Who are you?

Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.

Haha, very funny.

Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go!

You're damn right they do!

Or a really sweet one. 

Stop it!

No it isn't, you guys!

Motherfucker!

Wwow!

Hit the PA system NOW!  Put me in the main line! 

She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it.

Well, I guess we'll have to roshambo for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me square in the nuts as hard as you can...

They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.

Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?

That's funny.

All right! Let's go save those whales, you guys! 

We just received a letter from the WWE.

Just give me my money back.

Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'...  Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme.  Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this "Obama" wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline!  What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell!  You all know my pit boss, Butters.

Five dollars?! Jesus Christ!

I don't want powdered donut pancake surprise. All the kids at school call me fat!

Yes, and no time to do it. No time... 

Shh-shh, here he comes.

Me neither. 

Thank you, Rumpertumskin. And what do you think about me, Clyde Frog?

God, what a fag!

Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it?

That. Was. Amazing.

...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.

Wow, he’s good.

So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a  li'l ol' scheme  that involves them.

Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.

See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live. 

Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching murder porn, and now they're screwing up Minecraft too! 

Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?!

More Hot Pockets!

Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.

You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?

Because Jews don't believe in heaven!

Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet!

Get online now!

Monday she's a bitch, 
on Tuesday she's a bitch, 
on Wednesday to Saturday she's a bitch
Then on Sunday, just to be different, 
she's a super King Kamehameha bi-atch!

I will do the German dance for youIt's fun and gay and tra-la-la I hope my will enjoy my dance Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay

You got a hall pass, brah?!

I won't do it! He used to be my friend!

Jews...

Okay, It will be like this forever.

Oooh, then we can enter the carving contest! I'll run home and get money from Mother. Do you guys need some, too? 

Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.

Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat.

Wait. I remember. It was the red button! 

Previously on Battlestar Galactica 

Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?!  Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired.

Well, I guess now that that's out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy!  That's it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red rocket, dog. Red rocket now.

It does?

Full cheeks!  Winking brown eye, brown eye winking! 

Butters.

Uh ho, you guys.

I'm gonna, just give me a minute.

Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps!

Good, good.

I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself! 

Like find out where Mrs. Streible lives, and go over there, and... TP her house.

Naw uh, 'cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for me.  What is that? WHAT IS THAT?!

I am, too!

Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half.

Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams. 

And a tricky lahty do

That doesn't even make sense.

Lame!

He's fakin'! 

I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.

I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?!

Finish her dude, she's a zombie now!

It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal! 

No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!

Kyle, you're bein' an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah.  Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch! 

This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian!

Yeah, you know what?  Screw this!

Yes. I will be your new best friend.

Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle.

Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?

Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Did you all hear that?  Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this!

Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit.

Sorry Blavius. I've got other plans. 

They're everywhere!

We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers,  which led to their collapse. But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel?  We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well,  but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane?

'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!

Hey guys. Good morning.  You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon.

Huh? Oh no! Agh!  Get off me! Get off me! Somebody help!! Please?? Somebody get it off of me!! Get it off of me.

What the hell is Christmas Poo?

God, when is this gonna get to the commercials? 

How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!

It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay. 

Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention. 

Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys!  You guys, please don't tell anybody.

I'm not pouting! I just heard all these jokes before!

It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?

Well, I'm out guys.  If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends.

Hey, I don't have to take that kind of crap from you scrawny weaklings!  Eh, eh. Sweet. Check me out, I'm such a beefcake I can't even get through the door. Eh.

We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.

Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! 

Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence.

I'll kick you in the nuts!

Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday!

Jury found me innocent, Kyle!

You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!

But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave.

What the hell is wrong with you people?!

This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend. 

Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.

And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy?  At Besty Buy I'm sorry.  To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom?  Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?

Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live.  Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor. 

Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho,  huhuh, he, haha.

I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!!  It's wrong! 

Here, you need a smoke, brah?

That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized!

Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! 

How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?

I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now!

But I'm not gonna do the-

Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack? 

Well they should've gotten out of there!

Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.

AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please?

No, I didn't do a damn thing! Nothing! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!

Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.

We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! 

Butters, I had to!  Okay, I had to put it on the Internet!

Yeah!

Nothing. Now, sir, is there some kind of a...

Hey you guys, this works pretty good right now.

I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!

So?

Hi guys.

Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle.

The torso he would dump into the lake. 

You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!

Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei.

Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work.

What's this?

...All right, fine Chef, go!

Dicktits!

Wait, what?

Shoot him, Butters!

Bohogh, egh. 

We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico!  Oh, God dammit! 

You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. 

Oh God!  Hello? 

So our only solution is to cut off their life force.

Hey, I know! Let's go play laser tag at FunPlex.

Come on, let's go! 

He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how?

Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here!  Oh, you got it. Nice. 

Look you guys, Butters is asleep.

Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside. 

Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna be a great day. Great day tomorrow...  Tomorrow...  "Kyle, you were wrong! We did do a record deal!"  "You were wrong, Kyle!"  "Nananananaaana!"  "Hahahahahaaaha!"  "Nananananaaana!" "Hahahahahaaaha!"  Awesommme. Yeeessss.

Red Power!

Dude, come on! We've gotta get out of here! 

Maybe the world doesn't revolve around me. 

That's true.

That's only 72 shopping days left for you!

At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble!

I'm right here, Kyle.

That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him!

Oh I get it.  This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!

We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all. 

Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!

Really?!

Clear the streets! Everyone clear the streets! We've gotta get the fuck out of here!  Mom it's starting! We've gotta go!  Come on, come on!  Come on, we've gotta move! It's spreading! Let's go! 

I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem. 

Mom? Mom...

Sir, could you step out of the car, please?

But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!

Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again.

Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!

You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam. 

Man, that is tits!

Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing card!  You can deny it, or cover it up.

Ahall right dude, this is pretty sweet! .

Hey, how come you don't have sores on your lips, Ma?

Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?

You don't have a TV show anymore, Captain, so you can just suck my Japanese-imprisoned balls! 
I'm in a Japanese prison Lawd. 
Japanese balls got me down.

It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool. 

I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.

Pussy! Cock! Shit! 

Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants.

Awesome.

No. NO! Must protect the border! Everyone's gettin through! No! Clyde! We're losing! Kyle go through! Oh no, now Stan's through! And Jimmy! It's over! The only Mexican left is Butters; we've got...  Butters!  Hey! Wake up you guys! Wake up, losers!

Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in it's vagina! 

No! That's my walkie-talkie, he gave it to me!

I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about.

Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg!

No, kitty, you have to be quiet.

What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then.  Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away?  Gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.

Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers.  What?

Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!

Got ya! 

Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!

Well here.  Roy keeps the keys in the glove box.

Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! 

I can't see anything!

Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done.

A mountain lion! 

Lock the door! 

Yeah, me too. 

They mostly come at night, mostly.  Ey, I was watching Aliens on TV!

Sweeeeeett! 

I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?! 

Wait. I've got it.

Oh-Ho, gross!

What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you! 

Huh, I can't. I'm too tired.  Maybe tomorrow.

Hold the sign up, Kyle!  Higher, Kyle!  Okay.  Here we go. 

God damn it, this sucks ass!

Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh wicky wicky Wild West!
Shelly, guess who's busted!  Hey! I said, guess who's busted!  Eh, you're not gonna trick me, I've got the goods on you!

Again!

Heh, heheh.

Yeah, but not if you guys have one, too! Now it's worthless and gay! God-damnit I'll never try to be nice again! 

Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me.

Aaahh!  You sons of bitches!  You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need. 

That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.

They look exactly the same.

Heheh, okay, okay.

I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday.

I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.

Token's a smartass.

Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time.

I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass.

Well you know, it's a...  H-ho, awesome! 'Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.'With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of bricks.'What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me'I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously.'Seriously hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.

Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other.

For centuries alchemists have tried to come up with a formula to make gold. Whoever could do it would of course become rich, and now-! The chemical equation is right before our eyes. 

Almost there, you guys.

But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say.

NOOOO! 

Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?

No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys.

What's wrong with me? Let's see. Uum.  I hate you guys. You're hella stupid.

Meh, meuh urgh.  Mbeuh.

Oh, you guys sure are going a long ways to try and scare me. I want my Salisbury steak!

AWESOM-O does not have a mom.

It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up.

Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5  This is-oh my God, look at this you guys.  This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the rung just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello?

Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.

Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.

Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with.

Ehey hey, how's it going bros? This is CartmaaanBrah! And it looks like we're in the producer's office in Los Angeles now. 

What do you mean, Peter Panda?

The fuck is this?!

Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.

Oho! So you indeed me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset!

Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup!

No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here!  We're on our way, buddy.  Magic Johnson, here we come.

Whatevah! I'll crap in Maury's pants! 

Hey!  What the hell are you doing?  Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!

Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!

A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? No, let me guess: It's a Frogman Jay doll! No wait, I know! It's a police power chopper!

Ey! Aaah! Uh-ow! Ah! 

So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh? 

Oh my dick's gettin hard again! It's protrudin' out my paaaaants!

And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up!  Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad.  What the hell is going on?

No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea

I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice...  is the justice you take.  Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls. 

Yeess.  Yeess.  It worked, you guys, it actually worked!

So if we make Butters up to look like a dog...

Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle. You... just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money, hmhmm.

We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit.

I told them everything, you guys. It's over.

Oh God, I'm bored already.

Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina.

That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!

Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha.

No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes.

My goodness, that's a lovely dress you are wearing, Polly Prissy Pants.

Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!

You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right.

Stop calling me piggy!

What?

Because you took my Xbox.

Burn it down, dude! 

Where am I?

Yeah, that's me.

So long, Kyle!

Shit! Asshole!  'Scuse me. 

Let's go NASCAR!  I'm not moving, Butters.

Enter. 

Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?

Booooooo!

Wewewewewewe...

Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to "Phantom Of The Opera"?!  Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice.  Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!

What is he still doing here?!

KIIICK ASS!

Not at all.  "Wendy, we're gonna get you Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!"

I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!

Mike, speak.

How do I do that?

No! The bread's all flat! No!  Aaaaahhhh! 

Interesting, and why is it called Passover again? 

Parents?  Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around.

I think we're almost there, you guys.

Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of.  Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token.  Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln?  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.

What are we doing out here, you guys? I wanna see if Jakov wins that game show.

You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?

Dude! He's going to the nurse's office.

...I'll split the money with you. 

Mmmm.

What are you two boners doing?

Oh man, I thought that day would never end.

I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.  We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. 

Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes!  I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance.

What?

Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand...

No I can't; I'll always be like this. 

Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!

How come the outline is missing its hand?

Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us! 

We're playing "Lambs."

The answer to #27 is 5.

It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse.  Just back off, man!

These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard.

We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary.

My God, he's right.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death.  Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys.  Except for you, Kyle.

Wait a minute, isn't that...

Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here. 

That's right. Keep the change, my man.

Butters!

How the hell did you get out?

How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?

God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland!

SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH! 

Nuh-uh.

What?

Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?

Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff!

Who is it?!

Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?  What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right!  My balls!

God dammit stop ignoring me!

Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!

Yes! She fucks me so hard!

What do you want from me?

You guys, it's six in the morning, I have to get some sleep.

Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!

"It isn't safe." That's not what you said back in the cafeteria, Kyle. In the cafeteria you said Somalia was "awesome."

I want to know where I came from.

God-dammit! 

"But Mo-o-o-om."

Puh-I know, dude. Pete Melman crapped his pants. So freakin' funny! 

We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!

Agreed.

All right, see you there!  Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!

Kyle, quit it! Stop it, Kyle!

Hooray!

Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it.

Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!

Oh, looks like Kyle is commenting on my commenter window, bras! Be sure to comment on that. #kyleisgettingfrustrated

Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet?  Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!

Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!

I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.

All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! 

Alright. Why don't I have pinkeye then?

Gih-  Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please?

Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin.

Boner balls. Boner balls-boner... Boner forest. Dense... boner forest.

Bad Jimmy!

Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.

Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!!

Yes, but I'm not going to die.  That's why we gotta get along, people!

There's fear and darkness all around you
The criminals are on the run
No use in not having your hall pass
I'll take you to the principal 'cause I'm the Dawg
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg
The Hallway Monitor!

Come 'ere, crocky.

Is there anything else I can get for you?

What do you mean?

Wait wait! Wait, look at the lady judge.  She's eating Chipotle.

No time! NOOOOOOO!

Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters.

No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.

Sweet.

They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!

What is that?

Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn! 

All I know is I'm transginger, and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers.

No, it isn't, you guys. 

Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home! 

Christ, he's like 50 years old!

What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step?  So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tahink … tahink … tahink.

Mom, I am serious! This has gone on long enough! Get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken!  That's how you want it, bitch?! Fine!  I hate you! I'm running away!

Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass! 

Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?!  Hey, Kyle.  Uhh. Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh.  We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up.

Yeah?

No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems.

Aw, dude, gay!

You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device.

How long is that Chessy Poofs van gonna be outside?

I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.

Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.

My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet.

Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?

Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!!  Then... that...  Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!! 

Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy.

Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit.

Alright, alright.

Ok-Okay, okay.

Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?

That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.

No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick.

Fine! That's fine. 

Fly bu-what?

Haaahahahah. You're so funny, Jakov.

...and them I saw them all at the bus stop, and this son of a bitch is standing there!

I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.

Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!!  And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!!  They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep

This is bullcrap! 

Yeah?

No you're not.

Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti! You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!

We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer about the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that's supposed to play during the commercials.

What's the new topic?

Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.

AWESOM-O will answers the door. 

EHAGH!  Moooooommmm! 

What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?!

Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!

Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming.

Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job?

You're gonna fight me after school?

You're going down, bitch!

What?

...Oh, suck my balls, Kyle! 

What?! What the fuck that that mean?

I thought that-

What?? Who the hell is this?!

Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five.  On your American Express.

Well I'll tell you somethin'! Being from a low-income household isn't funny! Oh heell no, my momma's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam! 

Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?

An interrupting cow who

That does it!  I do not need to sit here and be ridiculed! I'm gonna go be home-schooled from now on!

I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.

Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?  Byah. Oof! 

The word is out.  "Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts." I tweeted it.  It's trending.

Sir! Sir!  If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you.  Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.

That's right, it's a butt fungus.

...Oh, man.

Wow!

Ichi banzai

Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well.

No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!

Whoa! Heheh.  Whoa!  Whoa! Heheheheheh.  Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the-uum, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh.

Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy! 

You guys can't scare me! I know you're making it all up.

Noooooo! 

So, how can Mr. Hankey be here, and in another mall at the same time?

Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you!

Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool!  Oh, what the hell?! 

Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?

Black people say Hey hey hey!  Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! White people got you beat, black people; you'd better represent! Let me hear you say "I don't blame the white people. No no no!"

That's four hundred for us! We did it! 

Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!

Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars. 

I wanna Fudge 'Em.

No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? "Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight." It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!

that's why they're lame.

That's right you will, God-Damnit.  Move it POVs, I'm an American!

Red Power!

Do not open your eyes until morning.  Or else I will kick you in the nuts.  Square in the nuts.

Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me-hee

Nuh uh.

Gee, that's kewl. 

Maybe this'll teach you to listen to authoritah. 

Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!

Why not?

What?! Eeyy, you son of a bitch! I'll kick you in the nuts! 

Hold it right there, Kyle! 

They're like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground.

Yes or no, Kyle?!

Oh my God! I'm a black African American!

Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. 

Dr. Mephesto, I need help.

I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!

Like anybody wants KFC without gravy!

Where is the detonator!

What could possibly go wrong?

Boooo!  Boo, Wendy! Boo, Wendy Testaburger, Boo!

Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moooommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars? 

Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!

Ohhhhh my God.

You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that-  Motherfucker!

Antonio, no!  You son of a bitch chicken from outer space... thing, come back here! 

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life.

No, I did, Pip.

Come on Fluffy! 

Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?

Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!

Butters? What the hell are you doing?

Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted.

God, will somebody shut her up?

I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done.  Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen.

Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.

Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!

Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first.  Goddamnit!

Okay. One! Two! 

What did I do to deserve this?!  How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!

All that treasure.  It's all mine!  So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it!  You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys!  Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass!  Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing. 

God-damnit, mom!

I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.

Oh, no.  Damnit!  No, Kitty! That's a-- Wait a minute. Come 'ere, Kitty!  Uh. Yes. Uh...

Dude, what's the matter?

AGGHHH! Let me live! AGGGHHH!

And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television.

Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. 

Hey, ah I feel a lot better.

Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales!

Ugh... Two people?

Uh... Ow! My ass!

We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?

Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!

Butters...  Butters! You can see me??

Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! Goddammit! 

Yeh.

His name is Token.

Hey! Hey, what is this?! Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you do this to me, God? Next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? 'Cause I like to get lubed before I get FUCKED! Huh?! Some lube would be nice! Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick next time you decide to FUCK me! 

What?

Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first.

Now how the hell did he do that? 

How?

That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.

...Alright, fine! Get in costume!

Butters, no! Are you crazy?!

Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind?

Guys, I need to talk to you.

GODDAMMIT!!!

I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.

Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer. 

They look great on you, Butters. They really do.

Mmm. It's chocolaty and delightful.

Kyle! Hey, Kyle!  I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance.

Mom, get the door! 

I only have three dollars left, asshole!

Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.

Nnno! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet!

Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.

Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up. 

So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did?  Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. . Kyle!

Not too expensive for Token's rich ass family, apparently. 

In virtual reality, yes you did.

Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop.

Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?

Uhh yes, of course?

That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle.  Gentlemen, I'm off to start planning! 

But I'm not a starving Etheropian! I have to get back home too!

C, H. "Ch." Chalk.

Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..

Wendy, Wendy.

The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power.

They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!

Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?

What is this, a PTA meeting? 

That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that?

Noooo...  Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.

...So?

Aww, see? That's what I was gonna say!

Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?

Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe! 

Well, you know, with your wiener.  Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. 

Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war!

No! No, it's too soon!

I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats.

Okay?

Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me.

Oh, really?

Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!

Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.

Then why don't you wanna go?

Gingers? No!

All right, here we go! Jimmy? 

We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here! 

Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright?

Where are we going?

You know, jus'... layin' down some rhymes for G-folk, you know what I'm sayin'?

Dude, don't call me a Canadian! 

Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things.

'Cause.  He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went.

Save me!

Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.

Nno Grandma.

It's the right address-wait! Look there!  There's Mrs. Streible! This is the place. 

I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.

Sent her away where?

Well my hot spicy boner, of course, Dad.

Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch! 

Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence.

I can't, my mom said...

That's easy!

Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time!

Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show?  Oh.

God, I hate you guys!

I did?

Now say it again, louder.

That guy's an asshole!

You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING!  He's here somewhere.

Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come.

Real guitars are for old people.

No, Kitty, this is my pot pie!

Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome.

Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? "Big titties! Buttmunch!" There's no walls anymore! "Shit!" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. "I wet my bed last night." 

Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now.

Right, heh.

Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.

Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it.

Wow, is that where Santa lives?

No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez.

Na-ah! She's being a total bitch!

Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go.

There she is! Get her!  Die, you stupid bitch!

I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!

Oh, thank God.

...Cocksucker!

We did!

Let's see. Oh! Oh! 

Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed.

Hm. That was... weird.

Not by giving me brain damage!

Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost Christmas! 

Okay, okay. I'll tell where the triangle is. It's inside my shoe. 

Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle!

Hey, dick-whore. I guess you saw the commercial, too.

A what??

Sick! Stop it, lady!

What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle.

Let's do this.  Stan, hook up my bra.

Where is Chef?

Clyde Frog! Clyde!? Clyde Frog?!  Clyde. CLYDE FROG! 

Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!

A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots & Ladders game used only three times, DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase of any deluxe hamburger at Red Robin.  All this can be yours. 

Mom?

Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me.

What?!

No thanks, I'd rather naught.

Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away.

You vas-deferens!

Butters-

You're not allowed to have people over!

Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy.  There. Yeahm.

Hahaha, now say "Caroline, don't go into the light!"

All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.

That co- ugh.  That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning.

No, no. Polacks aren't that funny dude. Try somethin' else. 

You want to sign Ms. Lopez?

And yeah, we want Cheesy Poofs!

Oh my gohhhd, so cute! 

Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class.

Dude, yuh-eh-you just don't...chop off somebody's fireman!

Awesome! Give me mine! 

Here's my snout.

Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back?

Yeah, what if we haven't?

Yyeessss! Yyeessss!  Awesome!  Ho ho!  Sweet!  Yes!  Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seat belts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft!  Yes!  Yes!  Oh, cool!  Oh, look how much fun I had!  Whoa! Heheheheh.  Ah! Heheh.  Whoa! Heh, heheh.  Woooo, Adventure Island! Check it out! Awesome!  Yoohoo! Yeh-hehess!  Yehess!  I'm so happy! I'm so happy..!

Um... okay. How about this:  Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a... golden retriever, or something.

...Oooo...

Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch.  Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face! 

"Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."

Aw, man, you guys suck.

Kyle, stop it!

Well, get me down from here!

I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!

I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.

Respect my authoritah!

Screw you guys, screw you guysScrew you guys, scr--

Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!

Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.

Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me.

Shut up, Butters.  Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning. 

Mr. Kitty, shhh!  Damn it!  Shhh, Mr. Kitty you have to be quiet, or else they're gonna find you.  What?!  It's the neighbor cat. He hasn't been caught yet.  No- no, Mr. Kitty. I know you like Rufus, but he has to fend for himself.  I can't hide anymore cats, Mr. Kitty.  I'm in trouble enough as it is.  All right, all right, fine. 

I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded! 

God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.

They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America.

If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct.

Where's your pass?! Show me your hall pass, brah!

Well, right, or we could always do that.

Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody.

Go... Right... Where am I going? 

And I am the official messenger boy, I am.

We can't let her get away with this!  I think tonight we need to do something drastic.

Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass! 

I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!

Hmmm.

Stan, are you getting good ideas?

All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly.  Oh jeez, no, no, I can't hide you all.  I'm sorry, you'll just have to find somewhere else to-  Well, I suppose I'll get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on. 

Jews...

How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!

Oh, god-damnit!

Butters, could you take a seat, please?

Shh!  I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer.

I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers.  And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, "I'm not getting away with this, am I?" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just-

Butters, can you keep a secret?

Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!

We want you to give our parents herpes.

Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.

Okay, how about this one, Kenny? 

You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!

I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.

No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh? 

Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!

Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math!

These guys are such blumpkin catchers.

Yeah. I didn't wanna do it, Jesus. They made me do that.

Sweet.

Look at, look at the description. Brown eye! 

Dude, girls are such fags. 

Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us. 

Yeah, I've been working this beat for about three days now. You definitely have to have pretty thick skin or else these people, they just walk all over you.  Sometimes you have to go undercover to get the worst of them. 

Yes! 

For what?!

Clyde's a dick.

Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! 

No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it. 

Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now!

You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off.

'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.

Okay, Butters, I'm booting up the core competency now.  Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?

Yeah, huh?  It-it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah!

Hoh, this should get some comments. 

Crack baby basketball.  Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us!  We could actually really use you!

Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God!

You're welcome!! Now leave us alone!!  My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and exterminate them!

Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!

This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys.

Stop? But why?

I see, very interesting. 

Pfft, apologize?!  That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.

You speak too much, sir!

Coma... How long?

Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it.

Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again!

Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!

I couldn't resist. I'm sorry. 

...The fuck are you talking about, Butters?

Me, too.  I'm choosing my own toys from now on, 'cause-- 

--way; Set an open course for the virgin sea
For I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard...

Nobody told us if we win too many games we'd go on to the finals!

"Rise above it!" Get it? Like he can rise above anything! 

Craig?! You asshole!

Race war! Come on! Race war!

Thank you, Stan.  Sh sh, here they come, here they come.  "And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?

It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo!

Which road?!

Sure, Kyle.

No. Nothing.

Will you all shut up so I can do this!?

I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.

I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behnd my back!

Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting.

Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's!

Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out. 

My dad was a Denver Bronco?

...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-

Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!

That inconsiderate jerk!

Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has…

Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass.

THAT's gay, heh.

Dude, how long is the wait?

What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times.

Who?

Dude, I want wings!  Ahghgh!!!  Oh Jesus, it's only you!

We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people.

I suppose your socks smell like the Botanical Gardens!

You were what?!

Hey, everybody! Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides , six roller coasters , and tons of great surprises!  And the best part is:  You can't come!!  That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister , a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow!  It's the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!!  So come on down to Cartmanland now!  But don't plan on getting past the parking lot,  'cause remember:  So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come!  Especially you, Stan and Kyle.

What's the matter?

Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. Respect my authoritah! 

They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!

Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale.

Hey, there it is!

Well we can just make them out of paper.

I said I'm a real person, asswipe!

No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback.

It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!

Me neither.

Mom, this is degrading!

They can't. Mephesto can't die.

His tongue? Chef?? Chef is my dad??

Ugh..! 

Really?

Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's.  It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap.  I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area.  I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents.  And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. 

Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.

Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in Santa's sleigh!

Kyle!

Help! Help! 

So who do we throw the party for?

The trees' biology?

Hey, yeah!

Aw crap!

Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow...  Yesss... Yeesss...

Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!

Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding!

Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach. 

This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.

Uh huh.

Okay, yeah, maybe.  God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us.

No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there!

Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become.

They're gonna... take over the world! HAA!  Too many of them.  No! Leave us alone!  Nooo!  Damn it no! No!

Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all.

Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.

Oh yeah?! I roam with twelve gangs! And we only commit hate crimes! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt! 

I'm juh duh duh duhhh! Do you know why you're a hallway monitor?! Because you don't have any friends! You should kill yourself! You should kill yourself!!

You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that not spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy! 

You see that? Dayanica Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off!

Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?

All right, fine! Forget it! 

Mom! The babysitter has her boyfriend over!

What's the matter Kenny?

Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God! 

Oh, my God, this guy again. 

Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die.

You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?

So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.

God damn it!

Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?

Hoh boy, here we go.

Oh my God!!

Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa!  Kyle, I'm totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time.

Uh, hold on just a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my payment?!  I'm not letting you guys screw me over again. Give me what I wanted, now!

Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?

Yeah, something feels...unfinished 

Dude, look! There's everyone's backyards!  Dude there's Craig's house! That's Craig's house!

...You're gay!

Ugh, ugh!

Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?!  Don't... touch us! We know what the Chinese are up to! We saw the Olympic Opening Ceremonies!  The gig is up! Everyone just s-step over to that wall!  I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them. 

Hi, Mr. Hankey. Nice to see yuh.

Nobody

That's awesome, Kenny. 

Hope you have a good one. See you later. 

Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen, okay. We were both at my house all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail! 

That was pretty cool.

Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it's tough, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.

Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away.

MOOOM! I can't find my mooom!

Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.

Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?

Yeah, yeah.

God damnit, you're supposed to trade those, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!

A marina?

Lehh, eh, screw you guys!

Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything.

You can't do that to me, I-

And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!

Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?

You guys are all such pussies!

The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!

Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants! 

No! We still have to fight!

You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time.

All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow.

Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it! 

Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle.

Right, and wi-  Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle.

Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole!

Aaaa-

No! Noooo!

Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.

Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.

Ten darra?! 

...play stupid games.

No, it's not good, it's fuckin' awesome!

and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.

You guys...  Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this.

I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima.

I knew it! 

No.

My family sucks ass!

I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it! 

I am studying, Mom. I'm learning with the Fonics Monkey. 

Juden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Juden est verboten, God dammit!

Heh, he's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass.

Calm down! We cannot understand you!

Uh oh. 

Huh?

Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too.

Tell me about it.

Oh man, you've got to be kidding me. God damn Japs are everywhere. 

Mom, I'm not going to win the spelling bee; I never do.

Damn, that kid is cool, huh?

Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle?

I don't. I made it up. 

But I won the environmental essay contest.

Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation.  This sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation." 

Surprise! 

Mexicans are told not to cheat. "Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child." So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.

Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark!

I just gave you AIDS.

Sweet.

He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.

Oh, nothing. No big deal, really.

Everybody get in a single-file line!

He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.

Stan, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you. 

Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest?

Where is your husband?

Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.

Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class,  you will see that the announcements are now being done in video.

Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh Kenny?

Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.

Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like "Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!"

Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey!  What the hell is that?

That's right.

Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company "Washington Redskins," it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people. 

Prepare for battle! 

We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?!

Oh, good. I'm starving.

What?!

Sorry about this.

We were there first!

Weak.

That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!

Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better!

Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second.  Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2  stand just a little bit more over...  here.  Let's see, maybe a little more up in here.  And just a wee bit over here.  And right about...  hm'ere.  There we go. Good. 

Oh, cool.

Ready. I will do the German dance for youIt's fun and gay and tra-la-laI hope my will enjoy my danceFiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ayWould you like some sauerkraut, German boy, German boy?Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut--

Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch.

We will!  Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy band of the country! Someday you will all be among those who can say, "I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall."  And so, without further ado, all five members of the...

Scared of a plastic frog?

You guys! 

Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say.

All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! 

Oh, that's so lame of them. 

But just remember that I do all the talking.

Shut up!

Have you been a good boy, Kyle? Have you been making Grandma proud?

Because, because what? Because he's cute?

It's okay, I'm here.

Argh!

...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing.

I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh! 

Higher, you guys.

That and youth. Those guys are old.

What's that supposed to mean?!

Uh-huh? That model airplane kit? Go on.

No.

I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.

Well. To think all this time I'm actually a Naive American.

I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?

Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today.

No Kitty, that a bad God-damned kitty! 

Who is this?

Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the coolest.  God damnit, there's no more Pengins!  Kenny, Pengin is my favorite. That's the last one. Let me have it. 

Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?

Oh ahhhh, three bucks.

All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.

You just hit each other, smack each other around. 

We don't care, Mom.

Oh, I like that. 

Go ahead, the door's right there.  Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu.  How do I reach these keeds?

That's what I said.

Okaaay.  I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon.

Yeah, I wanna leave.

Come on! 

Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here.

Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life.

Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.

Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing!

Zzzzt zzzzsssht!  Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out.

You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies Butters. You have to hurry!

Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left.  Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang!

God, I have to everything around here!

Are you going to eat those pancakes?

Just bring out Elton John already!

We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me?

Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.

No. NOO!  I won't do it. I won't do it, you hear me! I'm better than this.  And to hell with you, Mr. Kitty. You're a bad kitty! Bad, bad kitty! It's time somebody stood up, and did the right thing. 

What?!

Mom, I need another energy drink! 

Whoa, whoa! What?

Hey, you changed your clothes, Token.

Yeah yeah, enjoy the party. 

You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous.

You... You killed Kenny! 

A man just broke into my house and is-  Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?!

I've done it lots of times.

You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!

What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!

Who does she think telling me to go brush my teeth?!  Jesus. What's happening to me?

Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! That's an obvious suck-up move.

No, man, that's just a TV show.

Well, I gotta go home, guys. I'm gonna sit on the toilet and read comic books. See you at the bus stop tomorrow. 

Well, I'm a badass cowboy living in a cowboy's
Age, wicky wicky scratch yo yo bang bang
Me and Artemus Clyde Frog go save
Salma Hayek from the big metal spider
Wicky wicky wick, wicky wicky wick, Fresh

Well... mm-Rumpertumskin.

I don't know, it's just so... perfect. 

Yeah, go home you little dildo.

No, nothing  No, nothing here! Nothing this way!  Tr... treasure.

Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's fifty percent rise in one, year!

Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine. 

That's stupid and immature, Cartman!

Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news.  I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow.

Yeah!

Well, I can't find anything- wait. What's this? 

Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?

Man, that was such a bummer.

Christ's sake..!

Stupid asshole!  Yes, hello. I'd like to speak to the president of XBox, please... The president of XBox, like, the head of XBox... Fine, CEO of Microsoft, whatever. Put him on. I need help blowing up PlayStation people... Eric Cartman. I'm a wizard and a king... A wizard-king, yes... No, I'm not king of wizards, I'm a king that happens to be a wizard.  Just put the CEO of Microsoft on the phone!

He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls. 

Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much. 

Hello?

I told you guys. I've been watching all day.

Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle?

Thank you, thank you. 

...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call...

Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal!

Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!

Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on.  Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? 

Yes I will!

Yeah!

All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed.  Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!

All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout.  Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions?

Look, we spent all night at the recording studio. Now it's time to sleep!

Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?!

The rest of you will just have to try another day.

Dude, we need your turkey for our play!

That didn't help at all.

IT ISN'T OVER!!  It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!

It's Token. I think he's a ticking time bomb.

Dude, Filipino hookers don't get fucked the way I do!

...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda! 

Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve!  Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others. 

Stand by, please.

Hey Jimmy, what are you up to? 

Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.

No, Kitty! I don't have anything!

Don't talk about my mom like that!

Dude, since like, noon or 12:30 today. 

Asshoooles! 

Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters?

Gayness! 

Huh?

Ahem, how's it going brahs? This is CartmaaanBrah!

Yeah, listen, I'm running a retail business, but I can't get enough of people's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I'd like to buy some of yours.

Kenny's a random slut. 

U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!

See any hunters yet?

Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely.

Shhh! Butters!

Aw man, that was sooo awesome! 

You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep. 

Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!

Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!

You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys! I mean-

Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!

Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing. 

Ugh! Wait! You guys. Seriously. 

Could you um... go on the Maury Povich show with me and say that I'm out of control and do drugs and have sex so that I can go to the largest putt-putt gold course in the wwoooorrlldd?

We'll let you know, Butters.

What? 

Gaaah!  Heeee!

What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon?  Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse?

You see what you did, Kyle?!

Red Power!

Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him.  How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in Game of Thrones?

Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?

Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be so funny!

Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go!

Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, "Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it."

Oh? I've got a better idea. Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?

Jennifer Lopez

Wwhat's that?

He's a black kid that goes to my school?

The swimsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the candidates. 

You feel bad for the roosters?

Yes, bebebudjuhbluhbluhbluhbluh. Thank you. 

Bring it on, queer bait.  Aaaahhhh, yes! 

Silver Bells, Silver Bells, it's Christmas time in the city...

NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.

It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?

When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?

Uhhh??

Like, eight days ago.

Butters.

Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!

Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park...

Oh, then you won't mind if I take it! 

You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-damnit! I am so fucking sick of the future! 

Alright, Kyle, listen.  Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.

Dude, um, what are doing after school, Token? You wanna, you wanna hang out? 

Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.

Egh!

But... it's me.

Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?

Ohh. Nothing. It's just... nothing.

You're done?

It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in America, so we brought it back to your crappy country. 

No, you CAN'T go.  Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out

Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.

Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?

Just tell us already!

...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you Lord.

Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most.

Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya!

Ahh! 

Ah, crap! 

I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!

You ginger Jersey Jew!  Your tactics don't work on me!

Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!

Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister.  You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die.

Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!! 

God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!

I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing.

No??

Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.

Billy Mays!  It's him!

Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!

Cartman's birthday!

Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people!

Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea.

Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town.  They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested

That's right, you get back there.

What?

Really tough, you know. It's... really hard. It's like , we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures.

No. Whose betrayal is this? 

Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Token, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.

What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get?

No! Uh-I mean, eh, why would they do that?

Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!

This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life! 

Butters.

No! That'll just make you bigger fags!

Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye.  How's it goin', man?

...But he's not gonna get in trouble.

They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. 

Huh?

Really?! Nobody was playing with any fireworks?! 

I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, "Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!" and I smack him on the head!

Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now.

Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?

You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch.

Bliegh!  Yugh. Uh, okay, try again. Hep .

Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.

Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.

Huh??

This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth!  From with-

God I hate future TV. There's too many commercials! 

Alright Stan, just sit down at the computer. 

I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that?  You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper.

Dibs!

So I don't get AIDS.

No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!

Ey! What the hell is wrong with you people?!

Here.  Oh, hoho. Ow.

There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. 

Ms. Struthers, please. Just listen to me for one second. You started the Feed the Children Foundation for wonderful reasons: to help starving, helpless people who live in a rotten part of the world. Well, it's for those reasons we wanna help our friend Marvin now. 

Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?

Right, except for you.

Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?!

Oh, yeah.

Goddamn it! When are they gonna say "shit"?!

Jews...

Well, go put that pizza in the oven, bitch! I'm hungry!  Ow!

Aha, charade you are! Looks like you're the turd now!

Boy, I say.

How do you feel? Do you feel okay?

I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.

Really? Awesome!

Hmmm, let me see. No!

Token, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time  I'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock! 

¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?

Nuh-uh.

Where are you going?

Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?

No, never. It's perfect.

There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse.

He was a basketball player.

That's right!

Argh!

Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all "my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that." But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay?  See? You can't remember.

Alright, they're gone!  The Cartman store is open! 

Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well?

Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!

What the hell...? 

You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!

"Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson." 

Yaaaarrgh! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!

McNuggets is scared, dude!

Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?

A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this "poutaine".

...Okay, you have one minute.

Aaaah, runrunruuun! 

Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?!

Well then, perhaps we could interest you in  another butterscotch candy? 

So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, "I'll smash your teeth in!" My head is all like gashed open.

What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.

How much?

Uh, one.

What the hell?

It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.

Hey...

You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on!  Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan prediction from coming true, buddy?

Yes Mom?

Protruding vaginal boner.

God damnit! People are walking away! 

I'll take three lunches today, please.

What the hell is "Hooked On Monkey Fonics?"

Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was.
Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?
We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade
We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice
Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles
The world seemed to all make sense
but that sense seems to slowly fade
After Third Grade
In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons
We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue
We had warm cookies and hearts full of love
And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you...
There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute
To Third Grade

Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks! 

No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family.  I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could pretend like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, we could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day.

What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay.  Put him on speaker.

Where the fuck did he go?!  Haha! Game over, Butters! You lose!  The fuck is this?!  No. NO! 

Get to an airport!

It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't stay here, or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom.

Let's punch this baby.  We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on.  Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status?

Well, I tried.

Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!

Get their hands on what?  Dude... 

You've got to be kidding me!

I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath. 

Hello again!

A turd sandwich.

Aha! Do you see?

Goody two-shoes.

Alright, let's hear it for Kyle!  He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! That's super funny, guys!  Laugh it up, everyone!  Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel!

Hello??  Whoever you are, just give them back! Haven't you done enough to me?! 

You guys!  I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me!

YES! YES!

Look what we got.

That's right.

What now?

Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more. 

Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind. 

I'm going! 

Uuh, problem, guys.

It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude.

It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool?

How many people?

Alright are you ready to try this, guys?

...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex.

Until you puked on her.

Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. today. I have to be the first to get one!  Come on! 

You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too.

Oh, they think we meant gay fags.

Damnit! Damnit, I was so close! Damnit!

Yes! Yes!

Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame.

What is this? Halt!  It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me!

Hi Kyle. 

Oh, well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate pie, but uuuuh-I left it at home 

You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy.

Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final lie

You guys, Kenny's eating his own hands. 

Cripple fight!

So what?! That makes you from Jersey!

I brought it up because you already brought it up!

Let's hope to Christ this works. 

I ate my underwear!  What the hell do you want from me?!  Weh-

Now, personally, I like the baby green.  But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house.

OHH, SICK!! AWW THAT'S IT!  WE'RE LEAVING NOW!!

Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!!

You scared the crap out of me, Ike!

Okay, okay, okay you guys! You know what? You know what?  That's what.  Suck my clit and balls.

But  I'm gonna need your help.  Can you get psyched?? Are you gonna get  psyched up??

Oh, sweet! 

Jews.. ...play stupid games
Jews... that's why they're lame.

Nothin' Na- Due-nothing. 

Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?

Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?

So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?

Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!  Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for!

Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, "Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?" Right?

That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did!  Dude, it's Puff Daddy!

Garrison? But he's an asshole.

It's sad how jealous you are, Kyle. It really is.

Adults so don't get what's cool anymore.

Egghhh. Dude, home-schooling rules.  Yeeehhhhhhss! 

Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.

How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves.

You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel.

Kickass!! 

I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?

Nothing! 

Are you spying on me?!

Hey, hey! That's my bathroom! 

Thanks to Kyle's mother.

Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!

Okay okay, let's stop there for a minute. Remember, on tricka lahty do, that's a "lahty do" Okay, really need you guys to enunciate the "lahty" Uh, Nadif, if I can get you and Abdikaram to sing the harmony on the second "yo ho". And uh, Hashmish, is it? I'm sorry, but you're a little flat. Remember to sing out, don't close your throat, m'kay? So let's go from uh, bar 14. We'll pick up after the quarter rest. Ike? 

That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face!

Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom!

That's right Stan.  It's a cash cow, I tell you.

It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! 

G'dang g'dang! G'dang g'dang g'dank!

Oh. Hey, I'm out of control!

Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. 

Take him down. 

What?!

You'll be inside of me...

Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick.  Wendy, you're not gonna believe this.  I just found out my mom has breast cancer.  Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs.

Yes you do! 

We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh! 

All right, this should keep my cat in place while he spreads the urine.  Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? 

Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!

Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?

Hey, Chef.

Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything.

Excused? Oh, oh but we are in the middle of class. 

Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!!  Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! 

No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.

Yeah, and he’s Jewish.

Who's there?

Thank you.  Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative.

Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over.

No, I found it.

I'm not pickin' it ma! God damn it, I have an itch! 

Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?

Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies!

Huh? First graders?  Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, y-you sons of bitches!

Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends ; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now.

You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!

Ah! Eh. Nuh!  Less than a minute! Less than a minute!

Kiss it. Come on.  Kiss it.

You can't hurt me.

That's the proper way to say it, or else you get a spanking.

Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled! 

I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!

Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line.

Aw, son of a bitch!

Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen. 

So what?

I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video.  What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra.  And you're the first to see it.  This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this.  'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for...  right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again.  Wait for it... wait... there!  Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us.

Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.

O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?

Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!

Wha'evah! Wha'evah!  Maury, my mom can't control me, I'm tough! Go on, aks hurh!

Nonono. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second.  Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then?  Back then? Back then? Back then?  Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me.  With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.

Why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day?

Hello, is this City Wok?

Ey! 

Don't call me fat, buttfucker.

ANTHROPOLOGIST!

Ey, let me have some grounds. 

That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. 

Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns!

Oh, your pussy village?

NNNOOO!  No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!

Dude! That is Craig's mom's bush right there! Wait, wait what's that?  Oh shit, dude! Bail! Bail! 

That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is so cool.

A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here

What?

Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!

Eh-ih... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me.

Yeah, it sure does!

Oh my God, that is what I've always said.  I love this guy!

How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet.

Hi, cousin Elvin.

How do you know?! I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it.

GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! 

Can I ask you a question, Weasel?

Tha... thank you?

Hey, Jakov, how's it going?

Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-

'Cause I'm hella cool, that's why.

Forget it. 

No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle!  Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house! 

And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?

You guys, you guys!  I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters!

Oh fuck.  Oh what's the- God damn it!  Hello?

That's not true. You're just saying that.

You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media!  I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! 

Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere.

Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.

Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something.

Time out?

Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.

They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand! 

I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!

You guys see me block that defense today, I was kicking ass.

No, Mother! No more lies! 

Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!

You're sterile, is that it?  No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it?  Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless.

Look!  Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff.

Oh no? Don't you remember the time he went crazy, and tried to kill Kathie Lee Gifford?

—Christmastime is presents for me.

Heidi Turner  is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it.

No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something.

My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, don't ye. Well let me get right down to it theyen. Like yourself,  I am also in the slave trade.  But at the moment I find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin' if you could share some secrets.

Big Ring Slammer. Comes with posable neck-smash grip.  That's pretty kewl. Let's see...

I wonder who took it.

Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master.

We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.

Bye, Easter bunny! 

You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?

You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson.

I know. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck.

Happy Birthday to you. Happy- 

Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.

Go ahead, that's more for us.  You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry?  Who's the hungry man?

A-ha! 

Alright, stop, stop, stop!  This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot! 

That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday.

It wasn't me! 

Next audition!

I guess- we might as well- go home now. 

Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?

Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp! 

You say Kenny, but I say tomato! 

Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here.

You guys are just hella jealous.

Ehh, eh, ehhhh! 

Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.

Shut up, dildo!

Red Power!

Butters.

Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Choopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money... 

Huh?

I have to go number two.

Thank you. 

That we be, lass. It's all paid for on me mudder's credit card.

Stop playing games!

We're sorry.

No no, these guys were just leaving.  weren't you guys?

The same, you and I!

Hey, there's a pay phone!

I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?!

Why... why does that matter?

Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?

What'd we do to Timmy?

I love you too, man. I just  You look so delicious! Must eat your brains! 

Paradox...

NO!

You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!

Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and "filled the gap." 

Come to try and stop me?!  It isn't gonna work. 

Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here! 

I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band,  Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.

What?!

I have to call my friends over; they're never gonna believe it.

No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.

Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?

I'm happy that I totally got away with it.  What's a 911 area code? Hello?

This is very serious, Butters.

I'm a little piggy.

No, Kitty, this is my pot pie, Kitty!

Sir, step out of the car, please.

The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!

All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right?  I think I figured out how to do it.

Hooray! 

Yeah. So bad.

Oh, I'm not gloating. I just got a little call from a record company in Los Angeles and, they want Ms. Lopez to recored an album next week.

No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.

I'M SO PISSED OFF! 

Who are they??

Mmmhmm.

Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.

Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you. 

This... is your pirate boat? Dude, the FUCK! Alright, seriously you guys? What kind of pirates are you? I mean, really? The FUCK, dude, the FUCK?!

Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's eveyone, I guess.  All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.

I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.

If anybody calls or comes over, I'm not here, okay?

Video playback initialized. 

Stan, what the hell are you doing?! 

Medium spicy. 

You're a- stupid Jew.

Yeah, but we totally don't.

No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys? Carving pumpkins for Halloween?You guys are my best friendsThrough thick and thin, we've always been togetherWe're four of a kind, havin' fun all dayPallin' around and laughin' awayJust best friends, best friends are we.I love you guys. 

Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here.

Bye, Kyle!  Happy Channukah!

Ooo, ah, that's a different company.  Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ­¡Vamonos!

Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!

Me! Eric Cartman!

Thank you. Big-nosed kike! 

What contest?

That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay!

Go see the movie, Kyle!

Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party.

A clubhouse? Heheh, that's the lamest thing I've ever heard!

No way, dude! What would I wipe with?

Waitwaitwaitwait, cut!

Oh, hi, Chef.

I'm better-looking than you!  The girls think I'm better-looking than you, Kyle!

Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang. 

Okay...

I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg.

'S up, homies? 

Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms.

Dude, that was total carnage!

What? What joke? This is real!

Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!

Go kick his ass, Stan.

Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God.  Okay, okay, so get this, get this: The milk company calls me, right?  And they call me and say that two people from Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think it's their kid. 

It's all right. You've got it, no problem-  OP.

Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!

...Really?

Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic.

Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead! 

Uhhh excuse me? 

Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes!

Yich. 

Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like.

That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.

Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!

Oh, man, c'mon!

Heh yeah, that that's right.

But I...  but...  Stand back!

Jews...

Extra crispy? 

Mom, have you been here all day?!

What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.

Mom, I want a Twinkie.

Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.

Fuck!

Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.

No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!

Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny? 

Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Uheheheh, heh.

No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!!

Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there.

What? What the hell are you guys doing??

Shhh.  Be right with you.  We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed.

I think Sexual Harassment Panda is cool.

Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man.

No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances.

No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!

Okay, alright, so listen: I know our family is poor, okay?! But before we lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he's the poorest kid at this school!

There, see?! How do you like them apples!  HA!

Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!  Mom, can I watch American Gladiators?

He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night!

Aww, books? God, I hate those!

Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymarethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas.  God dammit! 

Right?

Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework,  gave me the soda from his lunch.  I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East.  Right, Kyle? 

And another thing: it says that Mr. Hankey is also appearing at the Crossroads Mall!

Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.

Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey!

Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls.

Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this? 

No way! I'm never going back to your parents' house!

It's my balls! 

Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!

Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!

Uh! 

Why?

Heheheheheh. 

Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!

Thank you! Thank you all. That's all I wanted to say. That and... The Bat-Mobile's outside.  Seriously guys, you gotta see it. The Bat-Mobile! It's outside.

Can we have some candy now please?!

Ow! I hate you!

Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere.

Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú?  ¡Carlos! ¡Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we  spackle with the sponge.  See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado.

Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.

Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!

Mom, seriously, people are seeing me!

This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys. 

How can I trust you?  How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself.  Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.

Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!

Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was.

Eh, I gotta get out of this stupid costume.

Wow.

I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real.

Ms. Crabtree?

What what?  Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning!

Oh God-damnit! 

Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair!

Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!

Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home.

You... You what?

Planetariums suck!

Sweet. What is it?

Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!

Oooh, I get it.

We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us?

Gross, Kyle!

They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train.

But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! 

Small penis?!

I want a part in the new movies!

Oh my god they're so gaaay!  Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap.

Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?

Black or white, it's alright. Black or white, let's not fight.
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the jury, so don't blame me, son!
James my man was wrong (It's not our fault). James my man was wrong (It's not Eric's fault).
Black or white, it's alright. Black or white, let's not fight.
White people say Ho-oh!

WAAAGH! Damn your black heart, Barbra Streisand!

Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?

Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!

Well then, perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population!

Aw awww!

Well well well, here he comes. It's BJ McKay and his best friend Bear.

You're being extremely negative, Craig. 

Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning.

I only know how to do it doggie style.

Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing!

Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on. 

Yeah? Well, where's his hall pass?!

Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!

You are all very bad kitties! That is a bad, bad kitty!

No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!

You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is. 

Yaaaaah! Wait! I'm sorry! Ah I'll stop! I'll stop!

1, 2, 3, 4...

Red Power!

Dammit! Tell me who my father is already!

Wo-what's that?

Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping.  Dammit!  Kyle, wait I-  Kyle, hold on a second!

Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys.

This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.

Let us get back to our work at the church.  Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah.  Hello?

She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes.

Hi, Mom.

Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip!

Yeahhh, you already know about it?

Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it.

Hey, I know how we get the balls on Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks down the street! They're always making crasy masks and special effects for their dumb movies.

Better.

How much KFC are we talking?

My baby takes the morning train and she takes another home again. Hmm.  What do we have heah? 

Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that.

Yeah, may be.

Ey! Don't call me a little piggy!

Thank you! Number twenty-four?  You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go!

Oh, I didn't think you were coming, Stan.

This is like my fifth time. 

Of course I am. This isn't about you. This is about CartmanBrah, brah.

Uh-huh-  Oho! Ohoho.

Yeeh, stealth bombers  Yeah, and talk about a bitch, I haven't seen-

That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.

Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again.

You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.

Whoa. What the hell?? 

Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?!  Ugh, goddammit you guys, this is so seriously. 

I'm a little piggy; here's my snout.
Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.
I'm a little piggy; here's
- Aalrightalrightalright, now give me back my money!

Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?

Goodbye Butters. I must be going now. I'll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters! Goodbye! 

I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant.

If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!

Yeah, well this year I have a secret weapon! 

... Oh dude, laaame.

How much further to Ottawa! Christmas is only twelve hours away.

Well, looks like once again, the Dawg has prevailed. I hope you've learned, kids, that if you don't go with Christ, you could end up just like that splattered bitch down on the pavement.

What?  Hello?

And with a yee hee hee!

Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool. 

Check.

Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-

Wow. What a day this has been. I was on TV, and, I'm a hero. 

Okay, bye. 

Hunh!

Yeah, I'll see you around.  Sure is too bad about my grandma, though...

They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again.

All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out! 

Aw God, that movie pissed me off.

That's not the way this country works, Kyle.  Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter.  It's the law.

That sounds perfect.

Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too.

LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!

There, you got it, you got it!

You guys, come here.  This is totally awesome.

I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.

Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality. 

Well...you did say free ice cream? 

Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at! 

I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!

...But Mo-o-om, I have to get Chinpokomon dolls before everybody else does, 'cause then I'll be coo-oo-ool.

At 1. p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.

Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!

All right! 

Ugh, finally!

Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle!

Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?

Hey, that is Tom Cruise! 

Is that why it stinks so bad? 

All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice. 

What the hell is that supposed to be?

And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say "Es ist Zeit für Säuberung," you all chant back "Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten."

Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I watched it on YouTube about sixty times.

That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve.

Ugh. Llet me go! Seriously!

"Coming in for attack, Captain." Pipew, pipipew  Give me the space cruiser, Kenny.

Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out.

Whatooya mean?

I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig!

...Wow.

Yeah!

Es ist Zeit für Rache!

Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott! 

Hey! He slept with my girlfriend, referee! In my country we don't wait for a bell, miste- ah!

Mr. Jefferson, hello?!

Well, I don't see any crocs out here.

The Rad Russian.

The fat one!

That's... so... cool!

Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh

Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America!

Okay, that's cool.

Oh!

Whoa! That totally surprised me!  I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.

Hahahahahaaaha! Hahahahahaaaha! Hahaha, Hahaha, Hahahahahahaha!

DO IT!  Come on buddy.

Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls!

Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?!

Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on.  Check it out. I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right? 

Don't give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy!  Oh wow, this is nice in here. The girls bathroom is a lot cleaner than the boys. 

Are you sure?

Aw, Ma.

No it isn't.

Yeah,  So, what are the plans to take over America again? I fohgot. 

Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny.

Ah, hello everyone. Achtung.  My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.  Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done.

Here, Butters!

Fuck you, Kyle! 

There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!

Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!

Totally!

So, what does that mean?

Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny! 

Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him.

This can't be happening! AGGGHH!!

You know how?

What the hell are they talking about?

Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.

We drill.  I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. They pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside.

Fine.

You're a jakovasaur; that's what they call you.

Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger.

I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog.  Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog!  I can meet new friends on the Internet!  Here's a chat room: "Men Who Like Young Boys"  That's perfect.  Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li-  Wow! Look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316.  Hi Tony.  "So what are you into?"  Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face.  "Kewl. Wanna get together?  Smiley-face?"  Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face.  "Meet me at Mel's Buffet restaurant tomorrow morning."  Sounds good. See you then! Clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face.  You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend!

Killer.

It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.

Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.

It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.

Suck my ass!

It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!

You do?

AIDS?

Hey Butters. How you holding up, man?

What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool!  You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!

No...  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!

Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!

...No.

You guys are in big trouble! Now get me down from here!

Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before.

Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh.  It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh.  He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish.

Boooo, Wendy Testaburger, Boooooo!  Boo Wendy! Liar!

Stop doing what?

Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?

Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! 

I have authoriteh?

Well, where is it?  What the hell is that?!

Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who my father is, I just have to. Maybe I can work in a sweatshop for a while uh...  Well, see you guys. I'm gonna go stay in my backyard for a while.

Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house.  Get out of here!

I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez.

Gay.

Oh God-damnit!!

Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale. 

Union Mafia bastards! 

There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow.

It's upside down.

Then maybe I can make myself believe it too.  Thanks you guys. I'm gonna go chase a dream. 

Yeah I do, pop tarts are frosted.

Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on. 

This is awesome!

Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus! 

Then we'll ride our Big Wheels.

Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo.  Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.

Did you make love?

Proper channels?

Dude, do you wanna the Terranace & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that? 

Red Power! 

You guys?  You guys, you'd better get over here.

Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.

You did?

Stinky britches, you got stinky britchesStinky, stinky britches, you got stinky--

Why the hell not?!

Come on in, Bob.  All right, just let me use my tools... 

Takin' a look here.  Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five.

Kick ass! 

But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.

You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag.  My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool. 

Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?!

I'll do it.

Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?

My potty? What are they going to do to it? 

Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too.  One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards!

I'd like to see you do better!

Stephen Tamil? The fifth grader?  Oh shit!  I told you to lock that door, Token!  No.  Nononono!  Where are they Kenny??!!

Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass!

God, I hate you, Kenny.  I have to get another knife; this one's hella dull! 

Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction.

Puhah! You guys don't follow Eavesdropper?   It's a Web site about all the students in the school! 

My stupid friends want to go to the mall to visit Mr. Hankey, but nobody would drive us.

It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it. 

Here we go, this has gotta be it right here. 

Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.

Ey! You ate all the pizza!

Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy.

Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush.

Nononono, you gotta go  "But Mo-o-o-om."

What?!

No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole!

Wait for it, wait for the whore line.

The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look.  There, okay. Let's see here.  Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?

Oh, Christ.

HUH?!

Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass.

Date-rape psychosis.

Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.

Testicles and scrotum! 

...I'm gonna be on television, I'm gonna be on television...

All right Butters, will you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.

Oh, hey, Kyle.

I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter!

There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!

You guys really think I could do this, don't you? You really believe in me. 

Kyle, what?!

We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance.

The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office.

Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.

I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do!  Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit.

MOM!

What?

Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes.

Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!

Uh. It's over?

'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.

Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.

Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable!

You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?!  This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home! 

Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh.

Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house!

Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans.

Hiya, Dad!

...play stupid games.

How good?

Step on up, get them here! Mr. Hankey & Me T-shirts! Get them while they last, folks. for only $14.95! 

Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now.

Quiet!

Yeah yeah, Pete Melman!

No. Dude, I've seen this on TV. They shine that light in your face, and then they try to get you to tell them stuff by squeezing your balls really hard.

Quiet, Ms. Lopez.

I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall-Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall-Mart all along!

I'm doing some sweet bun-sow moves.  I'm a little better than everyone else here.

But it was one of the best times I've ever had.

What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!

That's right! I'm back! 

Ha ha! 

So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Token's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!

G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!! 

Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye.  Brown eye! 

Get me down from here!

I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind.

Calm down, Kenny!

THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?

I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!

Billy Mays? Billy Mays?!  Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays!

Don't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunate! Follow me!  You guys, come on! Right now! 

Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!

Yeah, he called me a pussy! I'm not a pussy, you're a pussy!

Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash!

Aaah! Ten dollar!  Ten dollar, soldier boy!

I'm over here. 

Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry.

That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776. 

I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble if you don't-! Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine fine!

Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley.

Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to-

Who's "we"? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry!

Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?

We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend.

What?! Fuck you, Cupid Me!

Aw man, screw this. 

Oho yes! I did it I did it!

We need to speak with you, ma'am. 

Shotgun! It's my car, I call it first: shotgun!  Kenny, I called it shotgun!  Dammit, Kenny, get in the back!  Hey, Kenny, there's a sale on orange jackets over there.  Look, Kenny, there's an elephant parade!  Ken-ny. Kenny, look. Look! Go get it! , Go get it!  ha ha ha, you poor piece of crap. 

Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?!  His family's totally poor; I'm not staying with poor people!  All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man.

Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass.

Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart.

Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business.

Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece?

YOU SON OF A BITCH! 

Th... That is correct, my honor.

I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.

...play stupid games.

Butters.

That does it! I'm calling my mom right now, and bustin' your ass! 

Butters?

Oh. I uh... well I ah ah  I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term "fag," Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante?  Kenny?

So... here it is.

Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny!

Can't go on... need... appetizer... eh...  I'm sorry, God, I'm sorry I mocked poor people. I'm sorry I wasn't more sensitive. Please, Please God, uhh.  Heh, my god has forsaken me. Eh, err.  Huh, I wonder what's in here?  SNACKY CAKES!! MMMM!  Sally Struthers?!

Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave.  Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye...  Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right!

Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don't like the peanut-butter filled one.
Eric.

That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.

Holy shit I think I do.

Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis?

OP-pression!

Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them.

Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.

Five times one is of course...

They did?

No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle!

It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!

Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob.

Like what?

Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: "Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches"!  Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast!

Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.  Ah, now, where were we?

Put more clay on the balls.

There we go, Saright?

Yeah.

Oh my God, look at this!  Motherfucker!

Well, I do just as much work.

You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. "There's no tooth fairy." I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh...  M- Mom?

What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!

Yeah.

Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, Kyle!

What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!

Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!

Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow!

Later.

Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class, don't tell me how to run my hallway! 

Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS.

Huho. So you're not my dad?

Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable.  Let this be our final battle.  Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah!  Ugh. Kyle! Stop it!

...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too.

I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew!

Okay, fine!  I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!

What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??

Keep your mouth shut, brah!!

Egh-- 

Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks

Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.

Super neato! 

Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.

People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.

You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!

No! No! The bread is all flat! No!

Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.

Un oh...

Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Say that to my face, pussy!

You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man.

Oh, thank you, Jesus.  So we're friends now?

Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers!

Good morning, gentlemen.

Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro!  I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real.

Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage.  I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny!  I'm talking to you Kenny, achtung!  Poor piece of crap.

People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!

What? We're not gonna come visit him.

Giant Douche sucks!

But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps. 

Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!

Look, it's working! 

Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!

Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together.

And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs!  Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD.  The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?

Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal. 

I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!

Puh!

Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.

Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?!  Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore!

Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars.

I love Cheesy Poofs, you-

I believe in the family-owned enterprise.

Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.

Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!

NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die. 

Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.

Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians!

O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes. 

You're the worst character ever, Towelie.

No, Token! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah Token, Token!

You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your pants.

He might have been, by crikey.

Just another minute.

Oh, it's soo sweet, you guys.

Ow!

This is gonna be so fuckin' sweet.

Uuugh.

Whoa! Cooool!  Oh wooow! No waaay!  It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!!

Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- 

What's homecoming?

There it goes.

We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.

Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket!

U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her. 

So there is no war now in the future.

No way!

We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.

Vunter Slash?

He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude.

Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated!

I'm telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we don't have any privacy anymore!  Just between you and me, I think everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. Did you guys read "1984"?

They're going to kill me! 

Clyde!

Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense?

Yes.  And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle.  Good luck. 

You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake.

NO!

Butters.

Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!

Hoo-ray! Jakov is staying, you guys! 

Yeah, let's go.

Tih-  Tooth?  What the hell? Mom!

Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants. 

I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-

Hey, what about us? Our show? 

Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels. 

Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.

Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys.

I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time. 

Okay, listen up, Mexicans. We need you to read  "The Old Man and the Sea" for us. Comprende? "The Old Mand Y La Mer".

No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, "Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?" And I was all like, "No way!" And this little light went on in my head like, "Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin." But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  What a misunderstanding, huh? 

I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast!

You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say!  I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! 

Sweet, now I can just play with myself.  Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft! 

Yeah, that's right.

I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom.

Son of a bitch.

I slaughtered five baby seals with my bare hands. What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!

Nice form, compadre. 

How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond.

Yes! Go away, you stupid towel! 

Sweet.

If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down!

Will you tell me what they look like? The meteor shower. They mostly come every few years, mostly.

Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!

Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.

Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three feti; I've gotta sell the rest before they spoil.

What?!

Haaaa! Haaaa!

We always have.

Alright lads! Go home and write your farewell letters to your families! The land of pirates awaits! 

Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.

Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!

But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?

Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you.  And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!

I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!

Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!

Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.

Not interested I'm me?

Shut up already!

Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here?  Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle?

Please just let me go! Ah, I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna-  I don't wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you! 

Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump.

Por favor, buy our CDs de musica. 

I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass.  Shut up, you guys! It's not funny!

Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm home. 

I'm alive!  I'm alive, you guys.  I don't know how, but I'm alive!  Can you believe it? It's a miracle.  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.

Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.

Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy.

Nothing. Just leave me alone, okay?

You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass!

I thought I was safe here! Stay there guys, I'll be right back! 

Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.

Hey, that kind of looks like... Tom Selleck.

...Tits.

No. That's okay. I'll see you guys. 

There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!

Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!

Ah ah ah, that's my seat, Craig.

Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, "get the fudge out!" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!

Hah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you.  Ow! My ass! 

Oh yeah, watch me. 

So maybe she doesn't know.  Maybe she doesn't know, Kyle! Excuse me, Ma'am, I see you're eating Chipotle.

Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.

Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?

A snuke?

You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old.  I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.

All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.

Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go!  Oh my God! 

...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like...  Like uh...  Liiike...

Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay?

Man, Indians have it good, huh?

Heh, oh, nothing, forget it.

Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!

Well, I dreamt that I was a poor Vietnamese girl, and then you guys made me ride a big, scary bull, and then Leonardo DiCaprio gave me a spankin' for several hours.  Eeyy, where did you guys win all those Terrance and Phillip dolls?

So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!

Attention, shoppers. Outside, we have... cripple fight. Cripple fight outside! 

Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday.

Turn it off dude!

Open this door!

My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday.

Well, hi there.  Uh, wha-what are you doing tonight?

Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard! 

What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled! 

Turning right at O two four niner. 

Goddammit! Who's my father?

I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday Bunduru!  Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny's backstabbing game. 

Yeah that's good, but now go ARRRGH!

Did you guys see that? That was sweet.

You guys, my hand totally smells like spaghetti now. Smell it. 

I know, I know! 
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right

Alright, let's go! 

Ey, sweet!  Sweeeeeet! Check it out, guys; you don't even have to put a quarter in her.

Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?!

Goooood morning, guys!

Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours!

He's a little wuss, what's it look like? 

Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!  Die! 

No! No!!

Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off...  That's a dude jacking off...

And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.

Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!

You've already been here awhile, Kenny, so you have to introduce me to your friends, okay? And make sure they know I'm kewl. You've gotta have my back, Kenny! 

Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks!

No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone!

That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?

His mom... His mom goes: "Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay."

Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom!  Mom?  Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit. 

Yeah, we just have to keep him wet.

Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!

' No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just- uh.  Oh man.

Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better.

All right, that's good.  Okay, open your mouth, Butters?  That's good, just like that.

Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry. 

Why, thank you, Peter Panda. This is Distinctive Earl Grey.

Hello?

Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?

Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!

How's it going, everybody?

God damn it! 

He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?

...When I get all my superpowers, I'm gonna use them to smote you two assholes right off the planet!  Dude, superpowers are sweet.

You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch!

Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them.  Here, put these teeth in!  And just say "herro" and "prease" a lot.  "Oh, herro prease." Ping pong ching chong.

I can not possibly eat one more bite of its chocolaty goodness. Oh, but but but, but I'll try.

That should blah  ah- here. 

Yeah. Stinky, stinky britches

How much?

Yesh, kewl.

Eeeehh..!

No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno!

Oh bros, weak!

Yeah, come on, let's go!  I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!

Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!

Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! 

Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles...  Double-Stuff Oreos...  He ... He's taking the top of one and...  ...and he puts it together to make Quadruple-Stuffs!  I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs!

Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?

I know you're trying to make me feel better, Kyle, but a rich smart kid has no place on a racetrack. 

Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.

You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues

Oh. Um, uh... Kenny?  Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it. Huh, Kenny?

Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad!  All right, let's be partners, Kyle.

That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.

What the hell did I do?

Rrrrrrr! Principal Victoria. Principal.

God-damnit!

Poor people tend to live in clusters.

Give it back, Kyle!

Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!

Whooaa! 

Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!

Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh. 

Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!

Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!

Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.

I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies...  After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili.  Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott?  I call it, "Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."

We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.

We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!

You will?  Ah.  Oh, ah, thank you for your help.

I'm going as fast as I can!

Ye-ah, screw those guys. I don't even like them.

God dammit! 

Weak. 

You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.

Oh, no! This is my Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early!

Oh my God, and you can hear me??

Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.

Betsy MacIntosh?

Just take the money, Butters! 

Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!

Yes.  Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys? You can just...you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around,  or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters.

It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!

This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.

Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?

Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!

I'm still fucking angry!

Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was  smacked down by the Lord-uh!  God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh!  But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides,  so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya  to this part hmya.  Who will help us?

Hey, dudes.

Dude. Come on, now. Come on.

You know this guy?

Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me "fatass," "butthole," and "douchebag." I really don't feel like you guys's friend. 

Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed it to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well.  For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger!  Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia!  It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners.

Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And...Right-click!  What the? Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions! 

Whoa!

Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!

Marina del Rey
They're so nice to the homeless
built them port-a-potties

Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence.  Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave!  That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny.

What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?

Hey, it might be!

Six adorable children please.

Yes, very nice. Apparently, these are the pirates.

GOD I HATE CRAIG!!  That son of a... djah!! 

Sweet..!  Awww, dammit! Aw, not again!

Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura 2000.  Yeah, well,  it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's,  flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar.

Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards.  Wewewewewewe...

Primary engine running?

Outlander! 

Heh, sorry. 

Shut up!

Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.

My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean.

Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.

Pussy. 

That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended!  Yeahhh.  Mmm yeah, you like that?  All right, Clyde, you're first! Get up here!  Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde. 

Oh! Oh, I'm a I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez?  Is it a coincidence that they ended up together?!

It's still in baggage claims!

It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.

Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!

Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now!  Now you guys get down there-  Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go!  Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well.  Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too.  Hey Kyle. Have a seat.

No, you didn't.

I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class? 

Eeyyy , Spooky Laboratory, you guys. 

Well he called me chubby!

...Train together

Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die! 

Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?

Got it. 

What the hell?  Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only!

No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!

What's wrong?  Has he been checked for bombs?

Gimme that cake!

Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!

All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside.

Nobody's gonna know. We just drive it around the marina real quick. Look, if anything happens, I'll take full responsibility.

Don't, mother! Just, don't.

Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!

Son of a bitch!  Oh no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time!

I got it!

Oh my God, this is awesome! 

We didn't go to your comedy show.

Yeah.

"Thank you" and this is to..?

Bolo ties are...  really in right now. Cool you have one.

Get your ass to jail! 

Come on guys. Let's get out of here. 

Okay, we're ready for the-  What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!

I'm sorry. Did you say something, Skyler?  Agh!

Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.

Shu- shut up you guys, shut up you guys. 

Nobody.

What-evah! I ran for Congress and won. Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hid her body! What-evah, I'll do what I waunt!

Hooray for the South!

You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! 'Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!

All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black. 

Dang! That's nice!

I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys! 

Oh! God damnit!

Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there?

We had a little problem.

My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month.

Clyde, you there? Hello? 

Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!  What the fuck are you doing?!  Kyle, stop it!  God damn it, don't!  Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone!  NO!!  AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle!  Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND!  I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you!

Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.

Really?

Go away, Pip! Nobody likes you!

Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face!  Oh goodness, 'scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one.  Well, gotta run, everybody. Got some big things in the works.  Isn't having Tourette's awesome? 

Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-

You guys, seriously! somebody get me down from here!

Es ist Zeit für Rache!

Your gift of hope is a great deduction. 

Nuh-uh!

Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.

You got stinky britches, stinky--

You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.

Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome!

Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends! 

Uh huh.

We have to get out of here! Now!  Kyle! Kyle!! 

Washington. Redskins. 

Yeah, Starvin' Marvin.

...You see.  Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature!

I-I did. I wrote something down.  Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle. 

So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China.

All right!

What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!

We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!

Ey, you guys! 

Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is the NSA's worst nightmare!

Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny.

...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.

Oh. I can't take these. 

What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!

Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!

Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day.  However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood?  Alright, let's go. 

Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.

Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real!

Yeah. Come on in and join the party. 

Oh yeah?! Well I don't need you guys anyways! You guys can kiss my-  Aha! There's a king croc right there!  And what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna sneak up on it, and jam my thumb in its-

Let's see. I want that Clown Criminy game , and that Power Jim doll.  And, let's see...  Do you really like this remote-controlled truck?

Everyone hold! 

Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!

I'm playing the drum.

Oh my God! You guys have to do something!

Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for sure.

What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? 

That is really starting to piss me off.

Hey! The white man has marred my people long enough! You keep your God-damned mouth shut!  Stan, I need your bike in order to ride over to the reservation.

And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.

Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?

I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.

Duhhh!

How about we sing "Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch", in D minor.

The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! 

Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix! 

Yeah,  get out of here! 

God damnit!  Shut up, Kitty!  Any problems, contact Eric's Mommy at 303... Aha!  I'm gonna call mom and tell her that the babysitter is having her boyfriend come over! Then we'll see who's the turd! 

Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?

We have crab people. Just sayin'.

...I've got time. Do youuu??

You can't hit me! Didn't you see those nanny videos on TV? 

The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere!  Don't you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my God!  You guys! YOU GUYS!!

Hey dudes.  Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!

Hi Ellen.  Do you guys like fishsticks?  Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you.

I wasn't picking it-I had an itch, for cryin' out loud!

Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom. 

Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble!

I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault.

Oh okay.  Let's go NASCAR! 

You what? Stay at home? All day? No school?

"That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes."

Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!

Who are these buttholes?

I can hear you, douchebag.

That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!

You guys wanna see Craig's mom's bush?

Go on, Kyle.

What?!

Uh oh! Mmm-mm! 

Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack.

Mehah...  What's up, bin Laden?

More old people!

Not much, just taking my  one million dollars out of the bank. 

What if you didn't have to give it up?

My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure.

Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?

Sure, you guys, what-ever. 

There's more people viewing it!

Now you say, "It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again."

You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!

Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th. 

Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence.

Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts!

Shut up, Kyle!

Yeah, this guy crushes.

No- nooo.

Dude, I think it's totally working. The girls are totally buying it. 

Dah, give me that!  Talk to me Mike.

But I'll have to sing the Cheesy Poofs song for that talent va-a-an!

You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay.

That's it?

Oh?! Ohhh?!  Yes? Yeah, hello?

That's what I thought.

Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays?

What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys. 

Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars!  She's only given me a lousy quarter before!

Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, "Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!" Okay?

Hey, that's not a bad idea.

I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!

Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?

There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?!

I'm not fat!

Sweet.

Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.

Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?

Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. 

Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, "hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!" 

I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.

Heh.  Mom! Uh I can explain. It was all Shelly's fault! She didn't watch the cat!

Get down on the floor!

I don't know.

Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks. 

All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth.  God, this is gonna be hard to say.  I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change.  Help me change?

Well, you see Butters, everything worked out.  "Oh, thank you Eric. I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass."

It didn't work, Mom! I infiltrated the NSA, and I was a whistleblower and I thought everyone would be super-pissed off at what exposed about the government, but nobody cared! Nobody cares if the government is listening in on everything! Nobody cares if Santa Claus is hooked up to a big horrible machiiiine!

Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here?  Flame on!  Flame off! 

We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.

Mom! Doorbell!

Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week.  And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog.  And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of-  -eh- Ow!  D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow!  Eh! Oh! Help.  Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!

Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.

Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog.  Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your collar.  You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come home and save me.  Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope!  That's it! That's it, Mr. Kitty! 

Aw, crap- Kenny!  Bad. Kitties.

Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!

Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well.

I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you.

Ooo, Colonel?

But I don't know how it works.

I'm gonna be Jesus!

Do you know what this is?!  This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts. 

That's ten bucks you owe me, dick-face!

HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW! 

Oh, dude, here it comes!

Yeah, and I've learned something, too. Robert Smith kicks ass!  Oh no! She's back!

You guys. What if Ms. Crabtree doesn't come back, and we're all trapped here forever.

That isn't a very romantic story, Mom.

Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth! 

Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance.

Oh my... God. 

Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butthole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!

What else do I have to do?!

O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!

Now, leave me alone, don't do-  that, dugh  God-fucking-damnit!!! 

Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.

Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!

NO!

No no.  Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push.

Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew!

Jews...

Heh heh, I'm sweet.

Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here. 

Sweet. Now, I'm gonna go kill those guys!

Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?!  No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard!  No! 

Aha! I knew it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture!

Heeyy, that's Starvin' Marvin.

Jesus Christ! 

Yep!

Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. uh watchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it.

Why don't we just talk about the swastika?

Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us!  Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe! 

What? People see the truth?

Well, he hasn't been here yet. Where's this? 

I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.

Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat?

Hel-lo ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars?

Yeah I got the stuff.  And I got the money. 

You shut up,  ass-logger!

Whassat?

I can't. I have to go home and get in shape.

Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!

Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny?

I do! I do care! Look how much.  Look. Look how much I care. 

She's not here right now.

Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro, and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch.

No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...

You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?

Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg.

Eh!  Goddamnit, stop running into me! 

Wow! Kick ass!

Your girlfriend's a slut, dude.

Alright!

Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE.

Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.

I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?!  Do you think this is funny,..?

Gotcha! 

But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.

Jews…

In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. My only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here.  If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system.  Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all.

Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?

You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole!

Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too.

Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss.  Kiss it.

I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation! I don't need to hear crap from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial! Screw you guys! I'm going home.

All right, keeps your pants on.

Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA!  That son of a bitch!

I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it to the deep end.  I did it! I did it! I made it to the deep end! Hooray for me!

We are going to start... a Christian rock band.

Dude, it's Craig!

Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake! 

Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?

Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow. 

I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.

Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom.

I want one of those time-phone things.

No, no, he's done for. Come on! 

Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. He'd put balls on his chin. He was such an awesome friend.

Hey! You guys are screwin' up the song! 

Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?

Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?

Eh-- 
For I've got to be free
Free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard
We'll search for tomorrow, on every shore
And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on
Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay
A gathering of angels appeared above my head
They sang to us this song of hope
And this is what they said
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed about their starship and headed for the skies
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads

That makes sense.

Did you not see Erica Smith's boobs, Kyle? They're like perfect water balloons.

Really Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?

Lame, yes.

What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!

Mom! Answer the door!

Mister!  No! Stop, Token, stop! My brains! Stop eating my brains! Brad Pitt!  Hey Token. What's up, bro?  Fist bump? 

What are you?

Now you're gettin' it.

That's it! You've got it!

His name is Thumper?

Try doin' it faster

It's okay! I'm a hallway monitor!  Keep separation! Leeroy, check out our twenty!

Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?

Game on, Jew-boy!

Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know.  Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know, ...together?

Everything's great, Mom.  No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you silly! Noohoho! 

Craig, don't be an asshole.

What?

Kenny.  Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.

Yeah, History Channel rules.

Dude, that's awesome.

I got RIPPED OFF! 

The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us!

I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now.

That-s al- Oh, Cupid Me!  Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?!

Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce!  Oh God yes!  Where did you get that?!

I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices!

Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!

Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth! 

It is not!

What the fuck is this?! 

Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us.  Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted.

...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.

Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer.

Drive, Drive!

Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it!  I'm pretty sure this occurs only rarely in nature! 

Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album?

I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood.

I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone!  What did you do with my picture?!

Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until-  God-damnit!  Hey! Merry Christmas, asshole! 

Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.

What do you mean, Rumpertumskin?

If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left!  Black guy in the back!  Alight, now let's find Zimmerman.

Okay, hokay, I'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks!

I said, get off my boat!

Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle?

Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- "student atheletes" then?

Can't do anything?? You're the NSA!

Who? 

Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way. 

What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people.  What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?!

All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle.

What did you say?!

OH MY GOD!

It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it. 

Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit!  To arms!  Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an enire pirate crew willing to do anything for me!

What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die!

It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.

Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.

Romper?

But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.

Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool. 

I don't wanna.

Yeah I'm good. How are you, Kyle?  They're all gonna pay! Every day they pushed me and pushed, and if it happens again today, it's going to be the last time.  We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess.

Science-damnit!  Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records?

More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start.

Dumbass, it's November.  The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need.

No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!

It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor! 

The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...

Democrats piss me off!

Just ignore him; maybe he'll go away.

Could yo do me a favor?

How?

And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight! 

Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?

I don't know, two!

Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown.  Everyone's gonna be there!

No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?

Oh, man, this sucks.

Whoa! Calm down, ho. 

Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle! 

I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.

P'h. Nice costume, you guys. You spent about a buck fifty on those?

He's my evil twin? But he doesn't even look that much like me; he's all fat and stuff. He's hella lying.

I can't believe what I'm seeing.

Well if you get grounded in virtual reality you get grounded in real life too! For EVER! 

Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on.  Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow!

Stan, don't you know the first law of physics? Anything that's fun costs at least eight dollars.

Now, that's what I call a sti-

You can suck my balls!

Whoopee.

How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?

Hey, what the fuck dude?! God fucking damn it!

Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged turkey. 

Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!

Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home. 

Whoa, what uh, are you serious?  Oh my God, that's KFC gravy!  You have KFC! Yes!  This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?!

Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better!

Come on, brothers and sistersWe've all got to join togetherJoin together and give me moneySo I can buy more Chinpokomon!We've got to stop this fight and...

Radiohead. Yes, of course. 

Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later!  Aw, man, this is so tits!

Ey! I'm the leader of Earth!

Oh my God! 

We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead.

Let me guess: I'm in trouble again!

Why Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Token and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are!  Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?!

Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.

She's gonna close soon! Come on! 

Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!

Muscleman Marc! AAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAA!! 

IT'S NOT FUNNY, MOM!! 

Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever!

That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.

NOOOOOOO! 

You knew about this??

Alright.  Hey, this is great! 

All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair  and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!

Sweet!

Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?!

So who put his who-who-dilly in your cha-cha?

Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing?

This is where you came from?

We did it!  So long, Trent! Have a nice time!  Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!  Hahahahahaaahaaa! 

Good.

Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.

No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on! 

Ooohhh, forget it! 

'"I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink."' 

You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.

No, Kitty, you can't have any!

Mom, we're pretending, remember? Sex and drugs.

This is hopeless. How am I supposed to shoot Token with all these stupid rules?!  Wait a minute. I can't shoot Token,  but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida?

No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!

Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice.

Come on, we gotta get to work on some songs! 

Gentlemen, I thank you.

So what are you gonna do with all these underpants that you steal?

Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK! 

Why not?

It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now.  Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?

NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!

Huh?

Praise God-uh!

Where the hell is Stan?!

How much money did you micropay today, Stan?

What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!

Doodoo doot doo, dadadadada daa, ya da dadaa
Doodoo doot doo, dadada daa,
heydy heydy heydy,
how's it goin', guys?

Beefcake!

Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You're reached the big time. 

Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer "bad touch."

I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut! 

Of course, man. It's cool.

We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me where your son is!

Five bucks.

No, Chef has always been super-cool.

Uuugh.

We did it you guys. We're totally heroes.

Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter!

Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.

Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my asscheecks.

Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?!

We gotta get serious while we’re in our prime.

Uh Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now.

Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split

Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck. 

Dateline. Right.  I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye! 

You're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please!

Mom, she's lying!

Uh... no, that's okay, Mom.

Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy

"Nobody's gonna notice"?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?! 

It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole!

Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school.

Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick?  When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water,  and you put their hand in it... 

Huh?

Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs.

Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.

Right, I already got that one.

And shopping malls! Hooray! 

O! At least I have as ass, Jew!

Mom!

Yeah!

It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth!

Hey! Do you guys remember the time I found out who my father was?

Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states "benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being." I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters? 

Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!

Go on! Walk the plank, you scurvy dog!

You know we might not even make it into the studio.

Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!

Yeah. We'll start right away.  We'll have to do it without him.

No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!

You guys! Come quick! 

Cool.

Oh, doctor.  Thanks. Thanks. 

Remember candy, focus on the candy.

Even 10% is good enough. Here you go. 

Damnit! 

All right, Stan, you've got it, man!

Yep. We're all done with the video, let's move out! 

Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.

Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.

Ten percent, my balls, get lost!

You're gonna help me freeze myself.

Actually, gingervitus is the medical term.

He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.

Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad!

This... is so cool.

Why don't we just shoot him?

Aw, just a few more things.

Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!

Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!

Family Guy is written by manatees?  Of course, it all makes sense now.

Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you...

We'll see about that.  Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny.

KNOCK IT OFF!

Don't try to change the subject, Kyle.  You've done a really good job of getting out of this bet, but it's finally time to settle. Get ready for your sundae, Kyle. With extra nuts. 

Well well well well well well well well well Kyle! You came all this way to try and join my pirate club.

Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an overseer.

Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog.

(Hey! Help!) 

You song of a bitch!

Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry!

¡Respeto mi autóridad! 

Grab my hand.

Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape!

Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor.

Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland. 

Well, come on! I don't have much time! 

Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is?

Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep.

I- I, I learned that... you shouldn't judge somebody because... that-no, wait.

Hay, wait a minute.

Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls.

Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze.

What??

Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day.

Dude! Dude! DUDE!  The fuck are you doing?!

This guy sucks ass!

You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.

Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.  Haha, hahahaha! 

Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!

Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!

What?!

Looks like the game is over, old man! 

Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Oohh. Eow.

Oh, excellent! They're taking us to a ship. Once we commandeer our vessel the plundering will be easy indeed, lads. 

Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.

Stan? Has anybody actually seen the nurse, and come back to tell about it?

You say, "No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!"

Happy holidays, everyone!  Enjoy the rest of your lives with CartmanBrah.

Ohhh, God, No!

Eeyy! Give me that back!

W-yeah, of course. 

Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break.

Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you.

Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done.

You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again!

Nothing.

So I'm gonna stay like this forever?

What's your name?

Oooo, very nice.

It is fried chicken!  Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae.

I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere.

Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.

Hey guys. How's it going? 

What?! Aw, no!

Ey! I am a cop, and you will respect my authoritah!

Oh, now you've said it, too!

You guys cannot leave the pirate club now! How can you not want to stay in this paradise we've created?! In Somalia, people have no laws! They have no rules! And they never grow old!

No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit!

'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez. 

Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!

Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! 

No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!

Die? Kenny?

Hey, towel!

Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here. 

He's from Jersey, you guys.  Let's just get away from him.

Hey! You son of a bitch!

Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls!

Well yeah, dude.

Would you like to touch my body?
Come on and touch my body!
Oooo, my hot body!
Don't you like my hot body?
Come on and touch my titties!
I felt them just like?
Come on Justin, touch my body!
Mmm, Justin, yeah!
Touch my body! You and me!
Check it out, my not-hot body!
Come on, my body!

Hey Token. ...Sup bro? ...How's it goin' dude? I know how it feels now.

Five. 

Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll!

Interesting.  Ooo, Stan's asthma inhaler. I want that. 

Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?

The men are just inexperience, Sir Kyle. They need more training.

Yes! Move it! 

No!

Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!

Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it—hey come here, dog. Dog, come here! 

Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of "shit". We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob. 

Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. 

Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy! 

Forget him! He's done for! 

Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides!  Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared!  AAAGGGHHH....

There you go. 

Aaah! Son of a bitch!

So weak. So weak, dude. Man.

Seriously! Mom-

That's awesome. I'm so stoked that we're best friends.  Fist bump.  Fist bump. 

Oh, Jesus, dude. 

Egh. God damn it!  Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig.

Aww crap.

Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style!

You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to have a see.

Here it is, my big moment of fame.

Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man!

Answer it! 

Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time." When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.

It won't take long, sir.  Ow...

Hey, sucky-sucky? Only ten dollar.

Thaat's right, suck on that. 

It isn't fair!  You goddamned assholes, it isn't fair! 

This is killing me. The human body was not meant to move quickly like that.

What?! That's bullcrap! 

Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.

I ain't helpin' crap!  I want to eat some paeh.

All right, let's go! 

Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.

I'm pissed!

Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but…Patrick Duffy.

Damnit! I knew you'd say that! You always have it out for me!

Next?

Put the lotion in the fucking basket!  Oh no! Precious!  I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it!  Now you say, "Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!"

Shut up!

How the hell did Mr. Hankey get so popular? Look at all this Mr. Hankey stuff. 

Huh?  Eh. Aaah-ah! Aaah!

We're twice the ninjas you fags are!

No, it was just a dream, my mom said so.

Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion but-

Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl 

Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who's got Skidmarks Monday.

He's gone again.

Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think.  Do you see anything?

Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle,  I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.

This is gonna be fun!

I... am going... to Casa... Bonita! 

YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to fuck me!

Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert! 

Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots.

I can't go with you guys right now.

Ugh.

So this is it?

Mom! You got the new Duffy's catalog! I-I'm gonna circle everything I want for Christmas, okay? Mom? Okay? O-kay , let's see.  I waant... thiis... aand... this...  and...  let's see, comes with so...  ...comes with two bars , so there we go, have that...  and, let's see...

I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you...  pretend to use your finger like a gun or something.

Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand! 

Yikes!  Ow!  Son of a bitch!

Hi guys!  Very Merry Christmas. God bless one, everyone! 

I'll bet you can't.

Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.

No no, no. Separation.

Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!!  Dowww!

Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale.

No, my birthday isn't until Saturday.

Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.

Suck my balls!!!  Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously-

Yeah, I'll bet.

Sweet.  Hey Jimmy, what are you doin'?

That could be up to you.

All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out! 

Ow! Son of a bitch!

... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks. 

Hooray!

Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks!

That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls.

You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked!

No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!

God damn it, who the hell do you think you are?! If you don't stop right now-!

UUuuugh!! 

We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line.  That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and...

Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!

I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you're a good listener.

Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!

Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! 

Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.

No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out.

AWESOM-O does not understand.

Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one.  Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes?

Number seventeen step forward, please?  You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant. You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parrents died in the 9/11 attacks. Go!

It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs.

There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!

Yes, come in, please. 

Oh, Goddammit!

If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!

Huh.

Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  Wah! 

Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish.

Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home.

Eup. 

KFC!! 

Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn! Oh, for the love of God, how much longer?! 

Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good.

I... am... so... pissed... off... right... now.

Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.

If that was possible.

He's not our friend. 

Bad! 

Uh, god damnit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool. 

God damn it, shut up!

Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.

If we can hold on to the night.
We've got to find our way together...

My dad was a ginger!

Daaaa! Daaaa! '

I know my rights! Stop right now! 

I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.

Oh, so that's where all my underpants go.

Hey you guys.

Aww, my mom is so poor she walked down the road with one shoooe.  And if you ask her if she lost a shoe, she'd say "No, I found ooone."

Take it! I can't eat this crap!

What the hell is wrong with you?! Stop it, Kitty!

Every night, the dream is the same.  I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls.  And it turns out I was right. "Time to pay up, Kyle."  But then...  "NO! NOOO!"  It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust. 

...Token. Do you want me to pass her a jelly bean?

Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts! Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts! I'll kick you in the nuts!

So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?

Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!

Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.

Butters, you wanna play me next? 

If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face!  Well any God damned second, Kyle!

I thought you weren't supposed to run around with scissors.

That is so awesome!! Thank you God!  Oh praise God!

Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?

Hell, I'm not goin' with you!

Well, you can see here that we raised approximately $95, falling well short of our $2 million goal illustrated here.

You... your Mom said you could take three friends.

Aaaaa!  Yes!

Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we  all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion.

I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!

Memememee!

Yes.

What? Oh- AWWW!  Ben Affleck's spooge!!

Ike, will you do something about Clyde, please?  Very nice, Ike.  All right me hearties! Keep your eyes open for boats to plunder! 

Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!

I care! Where's the closest toy store??

Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!

Be a man Stan.  Just say, "Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies."

Ey! Ey, get me out of here! God-damnit! Ugh. Smells like Kenny's house in here.

Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk.

K-kill me.

Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us.

Oh no, really?

Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube.

No, it was just for a second!  What, what can I do? How how can I reverse this?

You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song.
I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me
I'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby!
You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right?
What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby!
Your love... is my life! You know when I’m without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh!
I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you to
Save me! Jee...sus...bay-by!

Thta's pretty kewl.

Christ...

Ech! Screw you guys. Home. 

What the?

I can't believe I got a stupid shirt!  The holidays are bullcrap!

How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door? 

I can't! They're stapled to my head!  I hate you guys.

Oh cool, the movie trailers!

SHUT UP, KITTY!

No, not with my eyes. With these!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Seventeen. 

What?

You guys! I got it!  It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!

Guess what I have sitting in my back yard?

Come on, bitch! Dance!

This is gonna be the best version of the Miracle Worker ever!

Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed. 

Now, zap his hella ass back to your- hella universe!

Friday?! Aw, Jesus!  I'll just... sort of get in here- in here. 

"Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling federation and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth."

Buh-ters! Buh-ters!

Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy.

I'm just thinking out loud.  Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh?

Dude, no way!

Dude, I'm a pirate! What the devil do I care what me mudder thinks anymore?

Oh my God you guys, look at this!  Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling.  Holy hell yes!

Take that, Jimmy!  And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again!  Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?!  Oh, Kyle. Hey.

Avast!  These aren't pirates, they're just a bunch of black people.

Or will there be?

Hey, Romper Stomper.

Nobody screws up my trick-or-treats and gets away with it!  Aaah, kew!

Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.

You're welcome, now leave us alone!!  Now! Let the extermination begin!  We will start... with the daywalker!

Eeeeeeh!

Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck!

Of course we know what a queef is, you queef!

Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter.

You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.

No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes.

Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything. 

But... Casa Bonita.

Dude, this is hella weird.

Yes. These people, Jakov, these people need you. I need you. Please, Jakov. Stay?

Ey!

He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men.

I'll eat my underwear, Wendy.  And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us.

Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh. '

Nope! It has to be Kyle!

I guess we gotta go back to school. 

I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera. 

Stan wants to ki-iss Wendy Testabur-ger

Amen. 

Well, Stan, thanks a lot for having such a cool uncle that got us all detention for a week.

Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?

No! Think about the people who could get hurt!

In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually- 

We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter! 

So? So now I can do this!  Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!

Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth!  Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse,  and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one,  think again. 

This... explains everything.

Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team.

Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.

Tweek!  TWEEK!!  TWEEK!!

We have to rehearse all that we can!  Now, check this out:  My mom made us costumes!

I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.

Food! I have to have food! 

I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!

Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here.

Pleeeeease???

There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!

It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.

This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.

That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.

Stan, okay. What's your name? 

Well, you... could make them... go away for a while.

Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this. 

This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on! 

Who cares??

Fine! Who would you go crazy for?

Yaaaay!

Um, it was um, this one time...

Oh, whoa. Whoa! 

Ey! Help me, you son of a bitch!  Huh, I'm gonna die up here.

Ey, you did me already!

Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass!

Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!

Memememeee! 

Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks.

HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!

I'm sorry, Principal Victoria. I didn't mean to do it, how could I have been so foolish?

I don't get it.

Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes.

But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do,  so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the--   Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-damnit..! 

What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?!

Why not? You chicken? 

Okay, how about ... that? 

They'll be done.  ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso?  All right, did you read the book?

Nice bolo tie, Stan.

OH, FUCK JESUS!! 

Mmoooomm?

It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.

Kick his nutsack! 

You don't drink tea in a ballpark, you French piece of crap!

You TIVO every episode of Family Guy?

Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.

Uh huh.

Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll.

What? I didn't do it, Kelly Nelson's a liar!

Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash! 

Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility.

...Aw man.

Uh- chair. C H A R E  God damnit, how come I get the hard ones?!  Get over here, you son of a bitch Fonics Monkey!

So where is Chief Running Water-I mean, Dad, now?

Come on, you guys, hurry!

I did it. I... AM... GOD!!!

Yeah, dude! My mom says all I have to do is chow on this box.

No! Don't!

No way! Flutes are totally gay!

Oh!! You guys, my ass, seriously..!

Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!

I'm prepared!  For my book report, I read The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. It was very, very good. Have you read it, Mr. Garrison?

Let's just see where Token's clothes come from, shall we?  Ooooo, Armani Exchange!

Oh my god, eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus help me!  Oh! I lost a doughnut!  Oooh! Oh oh!  Oh my God!  Leave no doughnut behind!

Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was?  God.  He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever.

Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!

You wanna know what it is, guys?

Piss off, you stupid assholes! 

Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?

What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?!

But we have to perform!

Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time.

Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here. 

They are gonna cut off his fireman!

Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.

What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!

The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass.

Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!

Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.  You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said.

Heh. Wow, that sucks.

This new song by Alanis Morissette. I can’t get it out of my head.Stinky britches, you got stinky britches

Fine.

I caught it, I caught it!

Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih!

I don't even know you dude!

Noooo...  Trying to find a job will be even harder.

I know I know, check it out, look.  I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!

That's right, Kyle.  Crap-filled vagina!

He is real, you guys. 

It's...  Why, it's a miracle, you guys! 

Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price.

Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.

Noooo!  I'm back. Wow! I'm back!

Oh, it looks like you finished your Fudgecicle, Elvin.  God damnit, be quiet, Elvin! Shut up, Elvin!  No, Elvin, bad Elvin! 

Who's we? You got a turd in your pocket? Hahahaha.

Oh-my-god!  You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.

And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! 

Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.

No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's  AAAA no, NAAAA!  I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year.  Ah, I need to be going now.

Miss Lopez, come on out here. 

Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?!

You mean, we make something that looks like a dead body?

Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-

Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole!

So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks!

We're goin' to see the mall manager.

Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.

Oh, I've got a better idea! Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms?! Because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me, Mom!

Step on it, Mr. Worf! 

Oh, Goddamnit!

Okay, Mom.

Oh man, this is so great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you! 

I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.

Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god.

Yeah sooo I'm thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of running water, yeah kind of Zen it out.

I guess, damn!

Uh oh.  Sounds like you're still angry, Token.

And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch.

Did you guys see a big panda bear in here, or not?

Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.

I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.

Seriusly! Why are you... doing this-?

Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm. 

That's fine! That's fine!! Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan!  Fuck you, Tweek!  Bebe, you're still cool. 

Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award.

It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!  I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- 

Ugh.  Just remember the song "Can't Touch This" and you'll remember the code word!

Oh no! Nononononono! Sorry, Wendy, this tryouts for a boy band! 

A grizzly bear!

Let me by...

Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are! 

Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.

Ahhh, sweet.

You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.

It's about friggin' time! Give me that! 

Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?

Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!

This kicks ass, you guys! John Elway is my father! 
My father is John Elway, my father is John Elway
Deedun, Deedun.

I am Captain Cartman and this here be my terrible crew! We be lookin' for a ship to pirate with

So... whatcha doin' for lunch? Eh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even baked cupcakes. 

It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?

Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.

No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!

What's goin' on?

Don't touch me! 

Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time.

I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things!

They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!

No. That's why I'm here. I think you should still give Heidi an A on the project. You see, I broke the egg, not her. And so, I should get an F, and she should get an A, which means that together the grade should average out to C minus for both of us.

Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive.

I have balls.

What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future.

I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you! 

A lot of stupid things that we regret.

Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye. 

Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me.

No, Mom, leave me alone! 

What the-? 

Yes! Yes I am, Billy Mays!

Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people. 

Here. We got you some sticky cinnamon buns. 

that's why they're lame.

And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...

Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. 

JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!

Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous!

I'm going this way!

Yes.

Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle.

Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now.

Mmm. I can't possibly finish this whole cake. Oh, yes I can. 

...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here.

Well, he is not listening to my authoritah!

Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like "No no, the fight hasn't started yet," and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair.

No! No, nono, you're right Bebe! Farts totally aren't funny. 

The Zookeeper 2: Zookeepier! 

Yes. Yes, sir, any second—we're just waiting on one more member.

Uh, Butters, I don't know how to tell you this, but, Lisa Berger is going out with Clyde.

...And so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television.

I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.

They're just standing there, talking. 

Oh, that's cool.

Hey, wait til you see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass.

Yep. All set.

We're trying to raise money for our friend, Chef.  Would you like a Moon Crunchie or a Snacky Cake?

Yes. He's been following us for like two hours. 

Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.

Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.

I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.

Uh-oh. 

Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick

I know what it means!

Oh-kay.

Well alright. 

Ah, Kenny! 

...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!!  Ready, pony?  Bite it!  Yes!! 

Whoa...

Hi guys.

Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.

Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this!

Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 

President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?

It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom. 

They were your FRIENDS!

Okay?

I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner-chicks like vacuum cleaners 

That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance & Phillip last night!

Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit. 

Come on, Kyle. Let these Sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control functionality. 

Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? 

All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?

I'm gonna tell my mom on you.

85 bucks?? I don't have that! 

Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the run-down school. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I should've done a long time ago.  Nobody notices what I have in my front pocket. A little surprise for them all.  I'm prepared for this, but still I wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will! 

Oh, I see. Now you're going to join in on the little joke huh?

No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you know, you're fuckin' fags. 

...No, our teacher's dead. Remember?

Token, you're... waiting tables?

Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball!

Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you!

You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it. 

Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?

Damn, Ken.

Nice, I like that.

Just get rid of it Butters! Don't tell me where you spend it and don't ever let me have it back.  From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.

What do you think it is?

Okay. 

All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf. 

Uh huh.

I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars!

Old people!

I have never been a dick to you.

Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!

Where are you going?!

Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself!

What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way we can get the new gaming system.

Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny.  Will you join me?

Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah.  "Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire." Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!

Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. 

Clyde, Clyde? Did you see that?  Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too.

Oho kick fucking ass, dude! 

It didn't smell that bad; you guys are overreacting.

Hahahahahaaaha!  I got you kinda! I got you kinda!

With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again , proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!

You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese.

Auth- authoritah?

Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement.

All we need is teeth.

Hello? Soldier boy. Me so horny. Me love you long time.

Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother is away at a party right now.

Hey Token!  What's up, bro?

Kick ass!

Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, "Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!"

Oh my God, this is just sooo awesome!

I'm not a robot, I'm a human!

Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling. 

Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard?

Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?!

I beg you to give me back my money.

Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!

I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!

Guys?!

More tea, Rumpertumskin?

Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?!  Oh yeah! She's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls, but she's dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! Stan-an's a gir-rl! You'd better curb your dog, Stan! You'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you! 

Sweet.

Dude, what the hell happened?

Your haiku insults have no effect on me, Kyle. I'm regional champion.

Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap!

Everyone target scorpions.

This... is... bullcrap!

Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing!  How do I reach these keeds?

You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me. 

Mommy, I want my Mommy! 

Hi, is Kenny home?

And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.

We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!

Eeyy!

Moving?

Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open!

Hey, stop it!

Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?

You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives.

Emmanuel Lewis, huh?

Country of origin?

I don't need the toy! I've found something better!  'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!

O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll
Kyle's mom is a bitch, 
she's a big fat bitch, 
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world
She a stupid bitch, 
if there ever was a bitch, 
she's a bitch to all the boys and girls.

Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone??

Aren't they cute, you guys?

Stupid puppet. 

No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!

AAAAH! 

Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?

Oh, here comes the unholy butthole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!

I'm so fucking bored! 

I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible.

You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.

Alright! Let's do it, boys! 

I'm gonna get you! 

Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?

This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future. 

He talked about having oral sex with my ass.

Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!

No! We were so close!

Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!

Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented Let's Plays, Kyle.

Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle.  Let's see what I can muster up here.

...No.

Really? You will?

You son of a bitch!  Wait a minute.  Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device. 

Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!

Oh, fat bitch, huh?!  Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT!

That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!

Oh, Goddammit!  They'd better not sell out!

Aw, Goddammit!

H'you guys! Come quick!  You won't believe it!

Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole!

You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?! 

Yeah, I love these Salty Chocolate Balls, Chef. 

Your CEOs?

Puh! I heard that.

You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.

Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before.

You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you!

You signed an agreement, Kyle!!

Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five.

Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.  Sure, we'd be happy to take your money. Yup. Go to our kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, bye bye.

We're playing Ninjas, Butters.

When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?

Oh, crap!

I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca.

Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?

Informative if you want to die.  Gusy, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all.  Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They're gonna GETCHA! 

Working on what?! Your dance moves?!

Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?

I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?

This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball.

...play stupid games.

Inspiration. Wait a minute,  that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?

Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?

Hey!  Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!

That's right, Butters.

Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time.

Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, "Poopypants Pete", but th- but then I also thought of "Mushpants Melman."

You know, there's really only two seasons here in South Park: Winter, and July, heh heh heh. But, but um, seriously, South Park has always been a place of discovery for me...  Ey, you sons of bitches! Get back here! I'm having a god-damned distinctive honor!

You ready?

In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one.

Oh! Oh, did you hear him?!  This is exactly what Adele is talking about!  Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle!  Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day  to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers!  You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look!  I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!

Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.

We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us! 

I would never let a woman kick my ass.  If she tried anything, I'd be like, "hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!"

NAMBLA?

Oh God, they're coming! 

It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.

Then I'mo kick your ass, Tweek!

Aw, man, this sucks! 

No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town.

You are, too!

How about geebo, or, or mung?

That was us!

You're a no-good swindler and a 2-bit thief. We were here for money, not goo!

Hey, everyone? Excuse me!  Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up.  Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle.

I don't wanna.

Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter.

Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am.

Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!

You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday.

Jews...

Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?

On my dream.  On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember...

Fuckin' gay as hell. 

The college know-it-all hippies.

We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus! 

Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor.

You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!

Okay, that's enough fatass jokes for this week.

I'm going to kill myself. 

Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this?  You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty.  Bad Mr. Kitty.  Bad kitty! No more memeing!  Come on, guys.  Bad Mr. Kitty!

Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives.

Right. I think I know exactly where to start.

Mom! Mom, they did it!

Well hello. Another person who  cares about the future of our school?

Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch.  Okay. 

I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty?

Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass!  Oh God, help me you guys!

Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies.  Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic?

Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars?

Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom.

Oho man, I can't wait!

...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters! 

I wish I was still there.

Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.

No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning.

All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice. 

What isn't it?

No! Goddammit no!

CartmaaanBrah!

NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!

Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together!  This is gonna be tits!

Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it!

Eric Cartman.

Hand over the gold!

What?

Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true.  I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera . I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children.

We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!

What the hell are you talking about?

Yeah, stupid.  Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's body is big enough for the both of us.  Shut up, Kenny.

You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it?  Hello?

They must have realized we left. Damn.

The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play?

...I think bail.

Mmmath homework, Mmmath homework. Where did I file that?

I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.

Okay. You win, Kyle.

All right, hang on. We're about to land.  Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.

God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk!

I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now,  I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here!

Don't talk to us, kid.

Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris!

Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play "Magic: The Gathering"?

You guys, that's it!

I told you guys.

Pube fair?

Not now, Mom! We're playing Texans versus Mexicans! Gah!  All right patrol, you all know the drill. Not one Mexican is to get past this border! Not a single one! Yeehaw!

That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh!  Theah!

M'kay.

Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.

Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.

Come on, Fonics Monkey, drum!  Come on! 

Well, because, unlike you guys, I just got my first pubes! Ayada da daa, yadadadadee! 

Who's this asshole?

I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body.

Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time.

Baby?!  Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!

I am Department of Interior guy, and I have authoritah!  No! Jakov, don't go!

I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever...  switch sides,  it could make Stan's army problematic for us.

Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here.

Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies

Uh bonus?

How about we have us, um... hmmm.

Where are you going, Stan?

Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you.

You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a winner...

I am the AWESOM-O 4000. 

Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call him Ben Assfleck.  Ben Assfleck, say that's funny.

whatwhatwhatwhat?  Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!

Awesome!

Did you guys see that?

Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. 

Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!

Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!

I'm gonna be home-schooled, and leave all the pain and suffering of public school behind me! Screw you guys, I'm a-gonna be home-schooled! 

Look: If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?!

What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated. 

Dude, what the hell is he doing?

I think my mom is a corporation.

Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an "A-"?

Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!

We're going again on Friday, right?

Jews can't be firemen.

Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.

Yes. Thanks to us and Chipotlaway, the spirits of the celebrities can now rest.

Well, I'm going to Spooky Laboratory!  Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells...

I was just-  I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial.

Oh wait, I get it now! The F-word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people. I'm sorry Momma.

Aw, crap, there's more of them?

All right, Butters! 

Aaah! It's the succubus! 

Damn, I'm pretty freakin' cool all of a sudden.

How's the clubhouse coming, Stan?

Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!

Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?

Well, screw you, fatasses! 

I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd!

I bet you twenty bucks it'll work!

Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh.  Here you go, God-damnit!

Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You  you actually got her to come! 

And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.

Jews...

That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry—

Yes.  Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous!

S'awright?

Ey! How come you never pick me?!

I've worked it all out on Expedia.  We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want.

Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right?

Cool.

Ey! Seriously!

It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.

What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!

Hey you guys.

I am not, Kyle!

But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time. 

There! 

Memememememe, me!

Nobody followed you, right? You didn't tell anybody?!

Yeah yeah, I'm showin' the guys!  Check it out. Eavesdropper got a hold of the phone call from the nurse to Pete Melman's mom.  Just listen, listen listen.

Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?

Damn, we might be screwed.

Dear Mr. Hansen, 
I have Tourettes and I want the world to understand what it's like. Won't you do a special report on me so that the world can learn to ACCEPT us instead of just laugh? Donkey Boner!!! 
Eric Cartman

Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind. 

So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue.

I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to our basement!

Cool! This game rules!

Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST!

God damn hippie! 

Whoa, whoa, wha- whoa, whoa!

Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water!

Come on, hurry up! 

Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.  Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?  You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.

...No.

Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!

Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!

You can let go now, Butters.

Yeah you! In the park this morning?! "I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!"

JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY!  It's Stan's stupid Captain America costume! That's what's throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to get that I'm the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?! 

...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!

How?!

Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!

Oh hey guys. How's it going?

Are you HIV-positive?  Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle!

Very nice. 

Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke!  "Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?" There! 

No, dude, it's... badass.

Naive American, Stan, and the bear is very important to my people. 

I told you guys! Here it is, right here. "The brown noise."

Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!

You're welcome. 

Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.

Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.

Fine! 

What?

I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!

Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face.

Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk.

Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this!

Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass! 

Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy!  Dude, what the hell?! Did you see the news?!

Butters' dad killed his mom. 

Hang on. I'm going to do something killer.  God damnit, stop it, Kyle!

Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag?

Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.

It's a midget, dude.

Butters...

So... you don't like Family Guy either, huh?

Guys, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure!  For that is the way of the--

Ugh... what... where...

Kill her Stan!

NO! NOOOOOOOO!

A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!

Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!

Oh, god damnit! 

Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual?

Sweet! I'm gonna be rich. Bet you wish you hadn't given me that triangle back now, huh, Kyle? Dumbass! 

My weenies won't cook.

Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!

Holy crap!  Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!

What has happened to this place?
I don’t recognize it anymore.
It used to be so fun and special.
What is life worth living for?
The dream is dead, our land is gone;
There’s a hole in my heart and I can’t go on.
There are too many minorities (minorities)
At my water park (my water park).
This was our land, our dream (our dream),
and they’ve taken it all away.
They just keep coming and coming (minorities).
I tried to go and tell the police,
But even the authorities
Are minorities
At my water park.
There’s no place for me to sit anymore,
And the lines just keep getting crazier.
There are Mexicans all around me.
The lazy river has never been lazier.
It’s a 40 minute wait to go down one slide,
And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!

What?  Hello?

Hey, I'm on your guys' side.

Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice.

Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts?

We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!

I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit!

And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could even be a spy!

Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat?  Okay, let's go.  So how are things, Kyle?

This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!

Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world!

You?!

Waaaaa! 

Oh there she is! There's my mom right now! 

You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?

Ah, dude, your dad's here.

There's no talking to this guy.

Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone?  Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!

Token, I wasn't on that jury. Okay?

Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners!  Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right?

Aw dude, look, there's Craig! Heheh.  Craig's mom is taking off her clothes.

Well, that should be fine, just fine. 

Oh. Really?

Who cares? Kenny's dead!  When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?

But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by.  You know the way out, right? 

What??  Who the fuck is this?!

Yuh, you mean it?

Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!

All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow!  Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde!  Clyde! Clyde, you asshole!  Goddamnit we lost Clyde!

You're the scientist, jackass!

Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?

This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot! 

Sister, have you read this book?

Hello-o.

Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways!  Screw you guys, I'm goin' home!

Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they'll try to unfreeze me right away.  I have to be hidden.  That's good.  And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!

You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick! 

You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf.

I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.

And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff. 

Nuh uh!

All right, when she stops yappin' again, say "Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right."

What the hell are you doing?!

Heyeah, I want to get a circumstision, too. 

If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, now let go of my hand.

Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise.

Okay, is everyone accounted for? Goddess Wind?

Turd sandwich.

Yeah? 

Hey you guys!  You know what time of year it is?

You have... sexually harassed me for the last time! It says right here... that now I can sue you and take all of your money.

...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?

All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters. 

I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. 

Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.

I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh?

Guys! Guys?  Can anybody hear me? You guys??  Token, Token, I'm here!  Hello! Hello! Hello!  Clyde, can't you feel me?  Feel me, Clyde!  Jimmy! Jimmy, it's me, Eric!  Jimmy!  Can't you feel your hair move?! That's me!  They don't even know yet, that one of their best friends is dead.  Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul.

Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country.

Ey! Get out of here, PewDiePie! This is MY holiday special!

The New Orleans Saints. 

Yes! I'm the best!

Kenny! Kenny, wake up!  Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny!

This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by  teh- ...tehhhh 

Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't.

I did it! I did it!

...I could pile at Shakey's, heck.  Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!

Sucky-sucky, five dollar.

Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip.

Who let-?

Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound? 

No, Kitty, you can't have these chicken tenders, because they are mine, and I keep mine to myself, oh?

It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome.  I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do! 

Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!

Kyle?

So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.

Sally. Sally Struthers. The lady on TV. She knows everything. Sally Struthers.

Bang bang bang... 

T'heh, whatever. 

Dude... Token!  Token. Dude.  Psst. Token.  Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Token! Yeah, get in there.

All right turd sandwich!

Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again. 

And then, you pee on it!  heheh-heheheheheheheh.

You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!

Beth found out they have a room at the Airport Hilton. We need to search it. Here's the hotel!  Beth, tell Leeroy to pull up here!  All right, let's go! Move out! 

Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew!  I'm gonna get that feeding tube removed if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court! 

Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.

Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.

Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.

For he is LordLord, Lord, LordWhere are you from, little boy? 

Look what the tooth fairy left me last night! 

All right. Give me $10. 

Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mackey?

Oh, son of a bitch!

WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-  -AAAH!

Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?

HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads!

All right, fine Wendy!  I'll fight ya you big bully!

You sonofabitch Butters!

You turned him into a teapot?

Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.

Ow! 

What?!

Ow!  That hurts, you buttlicker!

Heeeey! 

Minata! Kite kite, churi... 

God damn it!

Oho, looks like we've reached customer service, brahs. Now we can truly be everywhere!

No!

Now walk, Timmih! 

...No way.

Yich.

Don't worry, I'll get you down!

The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!

Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money.

I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.

Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.

Is a meme I will fight
'Cause I'm Faith Hilling 'til the day that I die.

That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me.

Whoa, how very very relevant.

Yeah?

Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach!  Oh, God! You guys are such pussies!  Hemmm...

Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them.

I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here

Huh!

Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen?

I never wanna see you again!  Take! Your sunshine! And frakin'! Die! 

Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?

It's okay, Red. I can take a shit here. I'm a dumb chick too. 

Get him out of here! 

We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.

Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?

Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money.

Token, you signed with us!

that's why they're lame.

No! But I don't... ah... ah...  Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back.

I was just thinkin' that... m-m-maybe we could... eat lunch together. I've always kind of...  liked you.

Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means.

Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!

Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend!

Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them.

Hello, Clyde.

Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters.  Well, let's get going, shall we?

It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.

I don't trust any of you assholes!  Where are you sons of bitches?! 

I'm right!

This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse! 

Where is your son?!

All right! 

Okay, okay, let's try to watch the language; there's children present heuh.

My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool.

All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. 
I need you in my life, Jesus.
I can't live without you, Jesus
And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.

I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.

It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole.

It’s all over the place. On the radio, MTV, everywhere.

No, he was just telling me about something funny that happened at school yesterday. Um, oh, but anyway, ohhh! Oh wow, I can't believe how great it feels to finally love my fellow man, huh? Isn't this great you guys? We sure have been throgh a lot! But in the end, we all learned it's best to get along.
Hand in hand, we can live together. Ginger or not, we're all the same.
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause it's lame. Come on, guys!
Hand in hand, we can live together.

Uh, screw you guys. Home. 

It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army , but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation.  It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be...  grounded?

It's okay Chef. Go on, remember!

It's all that matters!

No way, dude! We're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin' parents!

Kenny, when did you get here?

Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.

Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!

I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home!

It's over this way! Come on!

Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did.

Mom! Mom!

You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!

Your dad has a fucking drone?

What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.

Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?

Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful!

Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase.

Stop cheating, Craig! 

That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people! 

I get by. Let's see, I'm gonna need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings.

That kid is me.

Wha, what?

Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??

Kyle, open your eyes, man!

No. I say we take Topeka.

Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott? 

What do you mean, what am I doing?! Im just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys.

It's all Chinpokomon now.

What's that?

Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought!

Dürfen wir der Kind dort..  ...geboten?  Voilà, er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch. 

UUuuhh.  I sure am hungry.

Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!

I know. Let's go to the backyard. 

That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me.

Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image!  Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device.

I think I only need a hundred or so more aborted babies,  and I can finish up the kitchen.

Yeah, we want our money back!

There's even World War Three to look forward to.

They're not a part of your betrayal?

This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew.  Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.

One please.

Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?

God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch!

I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven't... had... KFC... in over... a week. 

I know. I'm scared too.

Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle.  Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard. 

You call them "bike-curious".

Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy?

Thank you, Butters! 

Yes, it's working! 

Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!

I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles-

I'm making it look like important people call us.

Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed…  in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room . Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open  and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway.  Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me.  And they had big heads and big black eyes…

Get out of here!

You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!

What?!

No! The Chinese, no! Somebody has to stop them!  No! No!

...and here's some old toys that I don't need anymore.  And here! Here's some Christmas cookies!  And some holly and mistletoe!  Oh, this'll the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too.

Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all up like little beavers, right, and then put 'em in a pond, and see if they build a dam! 

Damnit! Her boyfriend's here! Don't you believe me?!

Yeah! God, you guys are dicks!

Wendy,  I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight then I-

Where is Butters?

Well I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Japanese prison got me down
Said I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Don't belong here, my eyes are round.

That's enough to buy slaves!

Help! Help!

Uuugh! 

What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls?

No way dude. No way.

So?

Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ!

Haha. You fools have no idea that I would never let you hurt the Wall-Mart.

It's okay.  Mom? Bathroom!

A package? Oh, really? Well, I think I can sign for that!

Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch!

Shut your goddamn mouth.  We have Nilla Crunchies, Berry Bars--

Beefcake!

In here! 

Oh my God this is so awesome.

Heh- hello?

Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.

Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm.

Benjamin Franklin?

Oh God! 

Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish.

Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers? 

Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.  Wait, this isn't my house.

Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.

These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!

Kyle thought of it.  Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin' sweet, dude!  You're a fuckin' asshole!

I'm volunteering.

Jesus loves me this I know
'Cause Republicans tell me so
Little ones God will protect
'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect
Everything still clear out there?

Bear mace that guy! And that guy! 

Weak.

Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now.

That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts!

I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way.

Hey Butters, you got a minute?

Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?

Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose. 

Look, look how his face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!

Yeah. Too bad they have the personalities of a wet dishcloth. 

Dude, do we look like police?

Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.

Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!

You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!

Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!

But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight.  Of couse you don't have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation, they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership. Gaauu.  Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves.

Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like "Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!" 

Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!

Heheh, you suck, Kenny.

Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that.

Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!

Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!

Better.

Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?

Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see Prometheus? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about.

Ugh, let me talk to them. 

Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am.  See that? Hippies. 

Oh, awesome!!  Excuse me, excuse me? Can I get to eat some of your-  Thank you. Thank you.  Oh, I've got to get to Black Bart's Cave!  Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me! Coming through to Black Bart's Cave!  Oh!  Oh, scary! Look, a skeleton!  Oh man, I'm so scared!  Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers!  Come on! Come on, dive!  Dive, asshole!  Oh, awesome! That was cool, huh?  Whoa.  Sopapillas! Can I get some sopapillas please?!  Sweeet!  Oh! Booth! Puppet show! Puppet show! 

Uh what... what does that mean, "I'll be dead"? Hey, uh what, what was that "dead" part?

God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!

Because I do, Clyde.

Will you stop with the whole "mom smoking crack" thing?! It's a old joke!

You're my new mom?

You... can't leave. You're my friend.

What?

You can't go.

Calm down.

Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... 

Stan, nunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh hunh. Tunh tunh tunh tunh tinh teenh?

Mom?!

C'mon!

Butters, what are you up to?

No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.

Bathroom! Bathroom! 

Ey!

IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT! 

Four thousand dollars? 

Huh?

Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's goin' down, Jew-boy? 

Well, you heard wrong, hippie!

At least I have an asshole, Kyle! 

Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails?

Oh really. Ten thousand subscribers and counting, brah!

Yup! You know what Hillary says: "You can suck my clit and balls." 

She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.

You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours.

Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you...  you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved. 

I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.

We... are Fingerbang!

That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look.  Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar?

It had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding, huh?

Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault.

Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!

Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now.

What did you say?!

THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!

Yeah. Lucky for me the otters believed I was on their side.  Do me a favor: next time I'm in a recessed biocave, don't send me a level 2 homing call. 

Quiet, you sons of biscuit eaters! This boat is now pirate propertih! Now get ye to your lifeboat, lest you wanna be shark bait!

Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd better&lt;/&gt; do it better than that.  Next!

Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh-  I'm gonyanya, uhnyuh, uhnyuuh, nyaahh 

If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*  

Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?

Please Scott give me my money.

You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?

Man, that is the gayest dog I've ever seen.

Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them. 

You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like,  "my parents molestered me."

Awwwww!

The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!

Uh-huh??

Yeah, we're children.

Did you see that? Token was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead. 

Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.

Go on then! Say your last words!

Boyarrrgh!  Ike Broflovski! You littering my hallway, brah?!

No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!

Bobo?! Bobo, no!  Wha- 

We're fine!

Shyeah, that was pretty funny.

Dude, it was complete brutality!

Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters. 

Sir, we are in business!

Nnoo.

Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?!

Mmmm, no?

Alrighty then. 

How does he do that?

Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.

Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint green from its surface.

What are you doing, man?! 

Good man. Any luck here?

You may suck our collective balls, sir! 

Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang.

You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is so funny!

Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now.  Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha- 

Butters, it was my pleasure. 

Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?

Holy fuck, dude.

Maybe you have the parking brake on.

Yeah... Yeah, here you go. 

Oh, you're most certainly welcome.

It's a picture ...of me.  And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.

And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred.

Are you through databasing the clientele sheet?

Ok, let's go trick-or-treatin' now, come on!

Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?

Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed...  in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room.  Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open,  and the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway.  Then I was lying on a table,  and these scary hands wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes...

What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about?

What?

What a stupid bitch! 

Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle.

Because if you are, it's not cool!

The FUCK?!  'Scuse me, where are the pirates?  Hey, hey we're looking for the pirates? Where can we find the-uh!  Butters, get the phrase book out.  Ask these people where the pirates are.

I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!

Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.

Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.

Never mind him.  He's a very disturbed little boy.

Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?

That's right.

I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler.  Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh?  He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!

It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!

Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! "Fuck you." Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with.  To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting.  Now when people hear the name "Redskins", they will immediately think "titties" and "balls". It's just a bold new way that we can say "We don't fucking care." Go Redskins! 

It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!

Killer. 

I HAVE AIDS?

Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?

"Yes I do, you guys."  Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?

Well, I'm just saying na, don't mess with Kitty na.

Oh. Hey Kyle.

Come on!

It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.

What's that supposed to mean? Kyle?  Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!

Haha,  serves you right, asshole. 

We'll just see about that.

It worked for Creed!

Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares?

What-what do you mean?

You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!

Juvi Hall!  Stan's a loser! Stan's a loser! 

Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore.  Oh yes it is! 

No. See, must say, "Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?"

Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ??

Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle!  Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there.

Touchй, Mr. Mackey, touchй.

I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.

C'mon.

No, because people know I'm not fat! I'm buff. They probably put you at the bottom of the list because you have fucked up teeth! Or Kenny cause' he's poor

Sure you do. You're a great mom.Who's got the greatest mom in the world?I dooo.My mom is number one in my heart.It's true!

This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line!

What a crime. 

Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih.

Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that. 

Oh man! 

The guy on TV who had incredible things for people to buy? He died four months ago but they still show his commercials all the time? Oh, oh for the love of Christ, here!  Here here! This, this is him!

Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet. 

Yeh-heah, right!

Ha! Hahahahahaha

Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people.  Only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies. 

Nice!

Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.

Are you set?

That isn't necessary!

Of course he sings. He's black.

Ichi banzai! Kya!

I can't kick!

And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool.

What?

Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire. 

My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy.

Hey! I bet Kenny has some food stamps on him!

Post-season?

Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?

...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!

Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations.

Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!

Ooohhhh.

You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!

Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah.

Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place.

Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there.

I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch. 

All right. Guys, we need to talk.  You know, uh we can all just pretend... that we didn't see those opening ceremonies but, the Chinese... are very real. We've gotta do something.  Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?

All right, get down. This is my kind of bullride.

Please, Kyle. It's kind of important.

Mm-mo-om, Ah-ee née-eed suh-ome Weight Gain Four Thousaaand! I need iiit!

This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now.

Sweet!  Uh. Oh, goddamnit!

CartmaanBrah!

Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?

Chicken wings. 

Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--

E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.

Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?

What- What are you doing??  No!.. wuh...why?

Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking?  The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day.  See ya later.

...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull.

They what??

...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. 

Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton.

Come on!  Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry up in there?! 

Five darrar? 

Say "Uncle!"

Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place  in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please! 

Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now. 

Maybe- maybe he's still okay.  No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your-

I'm sorry, Token.

A- AIDS?

I wonder when the monster is gonna come back to feed again? 

You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?! Butters, do you really wanna just go back to school, where people just make fun of you?

You won't let me help.

Oh crap, there's a bunch of them. Never mind.  Holy shit, they shot this guy.

I got a jelly roll! I got a jelly roll! 

Zipliiine. 

But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.

Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me.

Suck my balls, 20!

Hall infraction! 

Mmmm.  Mmmm.

Well, looks like nobody's home.  Guess we should come back some other time.

Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caughts, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. 

Why, thank you, Polly Prissy Pants. How nice of you. 

Yeah... Sometimes upholding the law is messy. But you get by. One day at a time.

Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Good, that's good.  That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across.  Go easy. Good.

You'll never guess.

Okay, gracias.

Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample. 

Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people,  and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news.  You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends.

But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line.

No no, he's my lead. 

Oh, my God, that's so yesterday!

I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.

Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat.  Ah, sweet! The Red Cross!  I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please.

Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.

How are we gonna get it from him?

Hold it.

Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.

Kenny!

Are you sure? I haven't seen it.

You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility.  Ow..

Hm.

That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.

No! You wiped them all out!

It was not a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000! And if--  There he is!

Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.

Yes. And I've learned something, too.  Being a sellout is sweet. Because you make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don't have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home.

Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar!  So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah,  and putting a dollar in the box-ah!  Come on, don't be shy! Come on now! 

Fine, then you're comin' with me!

Ehhhhhhh. 

No no! 

Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off.

Wow.

Oh God, here we go again! 

I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!

Day is never finished, Massa got me working
Someday Massa set me free...

Aw, God-damnit!  LET ME OUT OF HMYA! 

No, you're already going to hell.

We're a non-profit company, Kyle.

I found this in the hallway.  Apparently your student Ike has a crush on you.  You got a crush on your teacher, brah?! Keep it out of my hallway! Go with Christ. Here you go. 

I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.

Huh. I don't have any ideas yet.

Wow, cool!

Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha! 

Just give me back my money...

Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass.

Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!

So what made you change your mind?

The Special Olympics? What's so special about them?

I'm gonna go take care of this prick!

Hoosajiggawha?

Okay, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to-

Yaaaay!  Oh cool, look. A Ben 10 Wrist Rocket! This is exactly what I wanted for Stan's birthday! What'd you get Stan?

Maaaa. Mommm.  Mommm.

Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey assholes!  You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right.

Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive animal lover. He's got a boner for this goat, a-

Mint condition, tax free.

Okay. 

What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!

I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone! O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!

Okay, you start on defense, amigo. 

NOOO!!

Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!

At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?!  What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies!

Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like, "Hey, get out of my ass you stupid rainbows!" 

This is a scientific test, designed to-

No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!

God I hope this works.

Welcome to this performance of Wrestling Takedown Federation: Smackdown. 

I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father.

Ey!

We got him! I know where he is!

That's right.

Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you!

What, they already have something better than Twitter?

Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about!  Now come on, guys! If you wanna be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are!  Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys!

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

At Best Buy.

Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!

Or if I did?

The hell did you do to us?!

Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!

We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!

Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as you can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead.

Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around.

Dude, shut the fuck up!

After you. 

He's a Jewish dolphin. A Jewphin.

That does it! I am suing you for sexual harassment!

Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month.

God Damnit, would you shut the hell up?!  Nobody gives a rat's ass.

Me?  I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men.

I'm not telling you.

That's it! Get in there you swarmy dogs!  Lower 'em down, Ike. 

Thank you. Thank you very much.  Thank you.

Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me.

No way! Those sons of bitches! I'm going home.

So that's what this is all about?

And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, "Whoa, I'm back."  Damn it if it's not the awesomest thing ever!

Just put it on, Butters.

I wanna shoot an Indian.

Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt! 

Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness. 

Really?

Oh, I mean, this is so cool!

Aww, sick dude!

Dude! That was so badass!

Hey, I was kidding. There's actually two girls hiding down there. Hey! 

Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy.

Yeah! You ripped off our idea!

God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?

They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go-  Thank you Butters. All right, we need to go over there and find out what we can from those Commie rats.  Oh, herro, prease, herro.

Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating.

Jews...

Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude. 

Ow!

Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it.

Whassup?  Whassup?

The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned!
The Body of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could call it my own!
You're one time, two times, three times my Savior...
Whenever I see Jesus up on that Cross I can't help but think that he looks kinda hot...

People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.

How about a robot? How much for the robot?

What?

Why?

...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away.

...Goddamnit! 

Okay fine, let him speak!  Then we kill every non-ginger here!  You... you what? 

Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! i'm walking out and I'm never coming back! 

Then you throw it away, smartass. 

Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.

You didn't read the rest, dude.

Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.

Uh-oh. Chef's moving in on Ms. Ellen.

God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!

You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!

What?! Why?

Oh yeah, nice, Kenny. 

Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you.

Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?

I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?

Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over?

Don't worry, Trent.

You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush.

Screw you guys! … Go to Hell!

You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said "Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone." But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way-  Oh, that's where I put those.  Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.

Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.

That's right.

So?

"Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes."

Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streible probably had it comin' to her.

That's right. Respect our authoritah.

It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again.

I was just setting it aside.

Yeah, I have some pubes to sell.

Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go?

Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this!  It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive!

Two donuts and a pack of licorice.  Well, Tony, the usual?  Why are you crying, Chad?

Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.

When are we gonna learn magic tricks?

They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey.

Oh wow, it's Adam Sandler.

No, Kitty, you bad kitt--!

Eugh... 

Holy Crap! 

Me??  There's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle. 

I want out.

God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream!

I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.

All right, major stone shield potions should be...Oh God, I'm going to have diarrhea again. Ohhh...Duuuh...

Command-0. 

Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation!

How do you know?

No! No, what's going on?!  Move aside! 

Tweek! Where are you going?

Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy!

You sons of bitches! 

Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damnit!

It's not fair! They were so... happy!

Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you!  Uh sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are!

How do I reach these keeds?  All right, let's go get you an abortion.

Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence.

You live on the moon?

Uh oo what?

All right men, rally up! There's still a Mexican out there and he ain't gettin' through!  You haven't won yet!  Game on!

You guys! Come out here! 

Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.

Kenny-chan, please come home at once. Our two houses have found peace. Come to the Red Robin wedding, and we will accept you as the princess you are. Yours truly, the Wizard King.

We don't have much time!

Oh shit, it's your dad! Go go go!  I'll see you later at my house.

Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.

How?!

Ey!

Hehe, I don't sound like that.

Well...  "Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"

Goddammit, don't shoot me!

Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school.

Hell, yeah I do, I got the triangle.I got the triangle, I got the triangle, dee dun dee dun

What d'ja say?

Not cool! Totally lame! 

Dolphins, eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap!

Stem cells, numbnuts!

All right, did you write the four essays?

Wow, a commercial?

You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class.

Digital malcontent now at parameter alpha. Prepare for full graphic interfaces on my mark: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Mark. 

Look at his lip.  You've got herpes, dude.

One testicle!  What an asshole! 

Oh, I'm sure I do.

Kill... you... guys! Kill you guys!!

Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now. 

Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one? 

D-don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together.

All right, tell me about it.

Why?

Really? That's cool. When did-  What did you say?  Trent Boyett?! Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at us, Trent Boyett?!

What do you mean? This song is sweet.

Yes sir!  Phew. 

Of course I care about Christmas- Doh, Christ on a stick! 

If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-

We're done! No more baseball!

All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back.  Melita! Melita, hold on.  You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?

...Huh? 

I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all.

Anything for more presents!

Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken.

Aww coool, huh Kenny? Peew Peew! I got a NASCAR, Kenny!  So awesome, huh Kenny? 

Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker.  This is going swimmingly. 

Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life.

There you are, Butters!

A Baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar...

Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember!  I shoved it up my ass!  Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap!  Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde...

You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??

Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!

Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.

WHAT?! KYLE?! 

Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!  Oh, awesome!!  Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave!  Wow, cliff divers!  More sopapillas, please! 

Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation.

What? NO!  NOO!!  You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over!

Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!

Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?

Hey, there you guys are!

No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!

Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together.

Yes. It's all finally come to fruition.  The final cog in my... master plan.  This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air.  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.

What a stupid voice.

Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?

I need to get stupid, Butters. I'm getting all the blood to rush to my head and watchin' a marathon of Two and a Half Men.

You're very welcome, Polly Prissy Pants.  Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?

Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too.

The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!

All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?

Tell her, tell her that I love her.

No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.

I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go.

I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to.  You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called "having your cake and eating it too."

You wrote it?

Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen!

That is so-ho lame!  Oh man, I...

Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.

They've got what backward? 

Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.

Oh no, there's much more.  Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it "New Moon Rising".  I did a whole study using my ass.  Here it is using some high-contrast stuff.  trying out some... different light filters here.  But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass.

Do you what this means?

Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said.

Thanks.  So, what I'm thinking is, "Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?" 

This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore.

Fine! And then we'll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too!

Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes. 

Oh, God damnit!

Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better.  Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we... 

Barely! 

Hup hup. Come on, hang on. 

Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!

If you want, I could help you.

What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!

Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth?

The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.

Dude, weak mom.

Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality.

Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!

Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!

See what I mean, you guys? 

Whatever it is, it's getting closer.  Ow! What the hell was that for!

That's it! Now I'm all pissed off!  Take that, hippie! 

We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!

Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?

Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?

I know, right?  A big rally to tell the government to stay out of our private lives! I'm gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages!  I seriously feel like I'm being spied on right now.  I'm sure the government has a file on me a mile long; that's why this is so important, you know?  Hang on, I'm gonna make a video blog for my "Stop Listening To Me" Web site.  What's up everybody? It's me again, just kicking it at my skeal. There's gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! Gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it's top secret!  You guys gonna update your blogs too?

U-hohhh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.

Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!

Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds!

All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.

I would like some Sunny Delight too.

Hey, wait a minute!  You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it!

I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides.  Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!

Ooooh-ho-ho-ho, gro-hoss! 

Jews...

Ugh. Uunnh.  Ey, give me that!  Ahhhh...

Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him. 

That's right... That's right!  Ohhh.  I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you.

Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?

Okay, let's see what Bill Kurtis says. 

What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck.

Oh no! You guys broke up?

Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?

The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!

I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie.

Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now.

And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!

Stan, don't be such a dumbass. You have to trust people. 

I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!

Now, the word is "spirituality." I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-

Goodbye, Polly Prissypants. I love you.

Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?

You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents!

Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?

Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!

Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay!

He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left. 

Töten sie die Juden. Wir können nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson. 

Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied!

So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. 

My house, too?

Choo-choo train! Yay! 

What?

Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it.

There is no money.

...Oh, okay, you figured me out.  Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble.

That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can really see them flourish. Tweek!

Ooooh.

What? That's called progress, Kyle.

Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?

Ugh. Oh, I know.  We can use Wacky Water Weasel! 

Yeah, dude, that's way over. 

Ugh, no more., 

How many hats have you made?

Hello, Mr. Hankey is appearing at the mall. Can somebody please take us?

What?

It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh...

Oh! God-damnit! Urh! You guys! You guys wanna hear my "I hate Stand and Kyle" song?! Ahem.I hate Stan and KyleI seriously hate Stan and Kyle...

Oh, no!

Just get me down from here!  Oh, finally! My arms are killing me!

It's going to rhyme, Token, just hold on.
I was not the shooter. I was not the gun.
So Token, you should be cool while we're all here at school.

Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized something.  We shouldn't be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us.  What have we become?

No you're not.

What?!

Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help.  But I hope that we're clear that this is my army.  There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules.

Clyde, Clyde! What have I told you about pissing on the seat? And Clyde's all like "Ah, okay mom, fuck! Not in front of my friends! 

Ah, that's better. 

Oh dude!  Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas!

Hey, who's screwing with the lights?

Ey, I'll get it!

Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle?

NO! No I don't wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT! 

You think I'm fat and unimportant now?!  I AM Eric Cartman! And I've got news for you! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, and on Alec Baldwin's new television show, via Shitter!

Ey!

I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet. 

Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!

Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video. 

No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be! 

I have the power to have all the powers I want.

Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-

Ironic how?

JESUS IS A LIE!

Yeah, because the government won't respect my privacy.

You will?

Really? You can? 

Yes! Yeehehehes! 

What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!

Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?!

Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!

Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool.

Yes, that was it. I was suh-so upset.  I couldn't concentrate the rest of the day. And the way his eyes kept looking at me, slowly going up and down my body, like he was undressing me with his eyes. 

Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?

Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch.

Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!

That's right!

Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!  I'm sick of it! It's completely immature.

You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers!

But can I still kill Kyyyle?

Killer. I'm gonna be on TV now. 

I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you put your who-who-dilly in her cha-cha, at the Drunken Barn Dance.

Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.

I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later.

Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?

...What do you mean?

Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid!

My moms barely bought me any presents so far.

Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!

Hahaha, no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much. 

Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!

Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! 

A child... and a female. And white.

I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?

Come... back. 

I'm not saying it!

My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa.

Hunh?  Uuh! 

I can't hear you! Lalalalalala!  I'm sorry, boys. But if you want to hurt the Wall-Mart, you'll have to go through me! 

Or, in other words, I'll let this jagu-ar bop me in the face and see if it hurts. Come on, jagu-ar, let's see what you've got!  Aaah! Ow, son of a bitch! 

Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started.

I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole.

I'm a professional, suh!  Don't worry about it, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied.

That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!

You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!

All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  See? All we have to do is cross out words like "baby" and "Darling" and replace them with  Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.

Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.

Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!

Look at me, livin' free
Free and clean amongst the Sea People
''We look for pirates and search for gold.
Life is an adventure with the Sea People
They don't ever complain, they don't call me fat.
They don't make me do homework or nothin' like that.
This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing,
Sea people and me.
Sea people and me, you guys.

Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it!  Oh no, it got Kyle!

No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine. 

Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free.  We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run?  An ice cream truck! Hey wait!  Boy, am I glad to see you!

'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? 

Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!

Oh, God, I can't see! 

I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it.

Come on. Come on.  Come on. Oho, this is so sweet!  You guys, seriously, this is sooo sweet!

Ziplining. Hell yeah.

Kyle, stop it!

What?

Yeah, see, the problem is, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kids in skewl!

Noh, he always pukes when he's in love.

Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?

No! You can't do this!

Okay.  Ohhh! God-dammit! 

What?

Be very very quiet. I'm hunting crocodiles, hahahahahaha.

Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!

How much further is it to Grandma's house? I wanna see what kind of present she got me.

Heh, four dollars for a goat? We got ripped off.

You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.

Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee!  Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while.  Oh, psych! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool!

Because that makes Butters gay now!

Whoa, Butters, chillax bro.

Look out!

...I've never heard the words "only" and "candy" in the same sentence before.

Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool.

Uh oh, it looks like Kyle is taking issue with something again. Kyle's got a pro-blem. CartmanBrah!

Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.

Juden!

What?

He used to be fat but not no more 

Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.

You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.

There's no such thing as UFOs. 

Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!

Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever!

Cucumber in the pants. Got it. 

All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.

I can't wait two months!  I can't! There has to be a way around this!

Sure, sure.

It's kind of funny, you guys.

Mm, mhm, mhm.

Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!

Fine, that's fine!

Ni-nice, okay.

In the ghetto
On a cold and gray Chicago morn 
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto... In the ghetto

Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus?

That's right, Cupid Me. People who are the same belong together.

I'm fahn. Just a lit-  No big deal.  Beh.

Perhaps we should take Topeka.

Ugh... Whatever. 

I'm not here, Butters.

Noo, let's save the "girlfriend is a whore" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.

Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.

We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow!  Get the lead out!

Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like.

Yes teacher.

It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps!

That'll be five dollars.

It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!

Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents!

Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap!

Eeheehee, Jesus Christ. 

So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes?

Who let the dogs out?

Get a hold of yourself, man!

You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah.

Ahaw, that's weak.

M'kay. Ahah-I'll be m'kay.

You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it.

Kyle please! I'm sorry!

Hi, are you Tony?
