Oh. I, I see. Welluh shucks, Kyle, I can't thank you enough for tryin' 
We should be able to find Jesus in no time!
Golly, that sure was swell. I'd say my Christmas special is going super-fantastic. Well, now it's time to hear from perhaps the two most important people of the whole season.
Well don't worry kids! I'm sending the nuggets up tomorrow to spread Christmas cheer!  And if you want, you can help them.
Simon's not so smart. He was born with a peanut in his head.
Wha- why do you, why do you have to say things like that in front of people?
We need to see Santa right away on urgent Christmas business.
Now you put that vase down! Put that vase down! That's a very expensive vase!  Don't you throw that vase! 
...Now come on, son. Don't be so down.
There's only one time of year I can come to the surface, and that's Christmastime. That's why I need you boys to go for me. 
I'm sorry, Kyle. I really thought my idea would work for you.
Oh, I just got a little cold is all. All these new people in South Park are stressful on my home.
Well, that was a nice little song, wasn't it? But let's not forget that for some people Christmas is about the birth of Jesus. So now, here's a more serious Christmas song, sung by Eric Cartman.
I know, Kyle. I've just been awfully busy with my family.  Honey!
Well, I guess that's about the end of my Christmas album. Gosh! It was sure nice hangin' out with y'all again. Well, I guess if there's just... one thing I have left to say, it would be this:
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
May your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight.
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay. 
From now on, our troubles will be miles away.
Christmastime wouldn't be the same without hugs and kisses and a Poo Choo Train.
Golly, that isn't very nice.  I'd sure like to teach him a lesson.
But son, you're a Hankey. We love Christmas!
Kyle. Be-fore I go there's something I must tell you. Come clo-ser.  Clo-ser.
Son...  You're the smartest piece of crap since Albert Poodinger! Come on! 
Good luck, Kyle. And we'll have that projector workin'! Don't you worry! 
It's completely destroyed! There's nothin' I can do!
Just like your heart beats without you thinking about it, so, too, your giraffes and your humans do what they do without you even thinkin' about it. But it is all one life form. It is all...  you.
No, I'm not leaving without you.  We started this together, we're gonna finish it together. 
Come on, gang, don't fight.  You people focus so hard on the things wrong with Christmas that you've forgotten what's so right about it.  Don't you see?  This is the one time of year we're s'posed to forget all the bad stuff, to stop worrying and being sad about the state of the world, and for just one day say, "Aw, the heck with it!  Let's sing and dance and bake cookies" 
Christmas is about feeling good. That's for everybody!
I couldn't have done it without you, Kyle.  Kisses. 
Autumn, you're drunk. Alright, now, just go help the other kids; they can't get their stockings up.
Folks'll gather round the fire
sing a song, stroll the choir
Pretty song they'll all retire
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho' 
These new folks in town eat nothin' but cous cous, tofu, and raw vegetables, and it's destroying my environment.
Gee whiz, things sure look Christmasy out here. What are you boys doin'?
Woohoo! Golly, that sure was fun. But now, for our next song, hold on to your bootstraps, 'cause we're gonna descend down into Hell!
Oh, big secret! Everyone can tell they're made of silicorn!
Hey, that's alright, Cornwallis. The boys' animated movie will being back the spirit of Christmas.
Boys, I want you to meet my wife. Autumn.
Hoooowwwwwdy-ho!!!  Howdy, folks.  Gosh you sure do smell all nice and flowery.
All right, just let me get my toothbrush. 
Oh, Kyle. Howdy-ho.  Well, how did it go? Is everyone gonna stop poopin' in my environment?
Not real? Well shucks.  If I weren't real, could I sing this jolly Christmas song? 
Santa Claus is on his way
He's loaded goodies on his sleigh
To drop them off on Christmas Day''
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho' 
Gosh, look at yuh. You're all growin' up sho fasht.
Gosh. I guess I don't know my own strength. 
HOWDY HO!
I'm Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
Season's greetings to all of you.
Let's sing songs and dance and play 
Now, before I melt away 
Here's a game I like to play:
Stick me in your mouth and try to say,
Well, oh boy, that was a super song! And now, let's hear from the school teacher, Mr. Garrison.
You know something, Kyle?  You smell an awful lot like flowers.
Okay! Boy, oh boy, this place suuure needs a lot of work.
Santa's loaded up his sleigh
flying around his merry way...
It sure has been tough. Nobody seems that into Christmas out there.
Aw, that was just a stupid song, Cornwallis! I was jus' tryin' to get you to stop your bitchin'
Have you all been brushing behind your teeth?
Well, I've got a loong night ahead of me.  Bye-bye and Merry Christmas 
Say, that sounds like a swell idea.  We can show everyone the true spirit of Christmas.
Santa, my friends are trying to do something very special this Christmas. Tell him, Eric.
Well, you see, boys, the sewer is a fragile ecosystem.
I reckon this could be a job for Mr. Hankey!  STOP FIGHTING!!
Sure. We should take this stuff to him right away!
It's my fault. All my fault. I got everyone's hopes up.
Cornwallis, we've got to go fix up the drive-in.
It certainly doesn't seem very Christmasy of them.
But crap is everything. 
Everything that lives on earth poos in some way
And that's how the cycle happens, each and every day
Just look at the green green grass and the birds up in the sky
It's all here because of poo, and now I'll tell you why
Grass it's eaten by cattle, which is eaten by women and men
It fuses with their bodies and becomes poo again
And that poo goes through the sewer, where it's dumped into the sea.
And it's eaten by the plankton, and becomes the fishes' meal.
And then that bigger fish with the poo still inside
Swims up near the shore and gets eaten alive
By the grizzly bear that poos on a dead piece of sand
So it can spring to life and become food for the land!
It's the poo of the antelope, the poo of the giraffe
It falls onto the earth and becomes the blades of grass
''The grass is eaten by the cattle, which comes out the other end
To make food for the humans and start all over again
You see, son? You're not an insignificant part of life. You are life.
Oh, that's no problem! We just need a little Christmas magic.  All aboard the Poo Choo Express!
You should be wearing socks to sleep, Kyle.  You're gonna catch a cold.
Well, gosh, Eric, looks like you really have the Christmas spirit!  I know someone who can help. Santa Claus!
Boy, things are starting to look Christmasy now!
Good job, Amber. Now this place is starting to look Christmasy 
Closer!  One time, when you were sleeping, I put myself in your mouth and had my friend take a picture. 
Howdy ho, boys? Let's get you back home. 
Hey, it looks like Santa has already made it to Baghdad. 
Poo Choo Train's layin' down its tracks with a
Come. You have to meet the little nuggets, too. Kids!  This is our son, Cornwallis.
Tell Santa's workers to keep making toys. We'll have Santa back in no time!
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough. 
Howdy-ho, folks. I'm afraid my buddy Kyle was right. There's not enough room in South Park to accommodate a festival.
Aw, it's too late for that, son. everyone' gone home. And I don't know nothin' about projectors. I'm just a stupid piece of crap.
I hope that Santa comes real soon
I've been waiting for some we...
