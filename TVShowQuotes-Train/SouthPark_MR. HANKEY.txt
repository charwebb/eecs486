Say, that sounds like a swell idea.  We can show everyone the true spirit of Christmas.
Howdy-ho, folks. I'm afraid my buddy Kyle was right. There's not enough room in South Park to accommodate a festival.
Simon's not so smart. He was born with a peanut in his head.
Christmas is about feeling good. That's for everybody!
Poo Choo Train's layin' down its tracks with a
Hey, that's alright, Cornwallis. The boys' animated movie will being back the spirit of Christmas.
Hoooowwwwwdy-ho!!!  Howdy, folks.  Gosh you sure do smell all nice and flowery.
Woohoo! Golly, that sure was fun. But now, for our next song, hold on to your bootstraps, 'cause we're gonna descend down into Hell!
No, I'm not leaving without you.  We started this together, we're gonna finish it together. 
These new folks in town eat nothin' but cous cous, tofu, and raw vegetables, and it's destroying my environment.
Son...  You're the smartest piece of crap since Albert Poodinger! Come on! 
I'm sorry, Kyle. I really thought my idea would work for you.
My family and I are here to get the drive-in ready for the biig movie.
Golly, that isn't very nice.  I'd sure like to teach him a lesson.
Uh, folks, please. Little towns like this simply aren't made for friggin' films. We love havin' visitors, but golly, too many of you is hurtin' our ecosystem. Be-sides, folks, film festivals shouldn't be about what celebrities are comin' or what film is gonna get sold. It should be about people gettin' together, and watchin' movies, and about people who could never get their movies seen havin' a chance to have it watched, if only once. A good film festival should be something where we all say, "Gaw, let's forget about lawyers and managers and studios and celebrities. Let's forget all those things for just a while, and just watch some new art." 
But crap is everything. 
Everything that lives on earth poos in some way
And that's how the cycle happens, each and every day
Just look at the green green grass and the birds up in the sky
It's all here because of poo, and now I'll tell you why
Grass it's eaten by cattle, which is eaten by women and men
It fuses with their bodies and becomes poo again
And that poo goes through the sewer, where it's dumped into the sea.
And it's eaten by the plankton, and becomes the fishes' meal.
And then that bigger fish with the poo still inside
Swims up near the shore and gets eaten alive
By the grizzly bear that poos on a dead piece of sand
So it can spring to life and become food for the land!
It's the poo of the antelope, the poo of the giraffe
It falls onto the earth and becomes the blades of grass
''The grass is eaten by the cattle, which comes out the other end
To make food for the humans and start all over again
You see, son? You're not an insignificant part of life. You are life.
All right, just let me get my toothbrush. 
But son, you're a Hankey. We love Christmas!
Aw, that was just a stupid song, Cornwallis! I was jus' tryin' to get you to stop your bitchin'
I hope that Santa comes real soon
I've been waiting for some we...
Well, that was a nice little song, wasn't it? But let's not forget that for some people Christmas is about the birth of Jesus. So now, here's a more serious Christmas song, sung by Eric Cartman.
Well don't worry kids! I'm sending the nuggets up tomorrow to spread Christmas cheer!  And if you want, you can help them.
Oh, that's no problem! We just need a little Christmas magic.  All aboard the Poo Choo Express!
Hi, Chef. Your big chocolate balls are just the trick! 
Just like your heart beats without you thinking about it, so, too, your giraffes and your humans do what they do without you even thinkin' about it. But it is all one life form. It is all...  you.
Sure. We should take this stuff to him right away!
Folks'll gather round the fire
sing a song, stroll the choir
Pretty song they'll all retire
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho' 
Gee whiz, things sure look Christmasy out here. What are you boys doin'?
Oh, Kyle. Howdy-ho.  Well, how did it go? Is everyone gonna stop poopin' in my environment?
No, you're not a part of it, Cornwallis. You're all of it. Don't you see?
Okay! Boy, oh boy, this place suuure needs a lot of work.
Well, you see, boys, the sewer is a fragile ecosystem.
You know something, Kyle?  You smell an awful lot like flowers.
Howdy ho, boys? Let's get you back home. 
Tell Santa's workers to keep making toys. We'll have Santa back in no time!
Good job, Amber. Now this place is starting to look Christmasy 
Wha- why do you, why do you have to say things like that in front of people?
Well, gosh, Eric, looks like you really have the Christmas spirit!  I know someone who can help. Santa Claus!
Hey, it looks like Santa has already made it to Baghdad. 
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough. 
Not real? Well shucks.  If I weren't real, could I sing this jolly Christmas song? 
Santa Claus is on his way
He's loaded goodies on his sleigh
To drop them off on Christmas Day''
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho' 
We should be able to find Jesus in no time!
I reckon this could be a job for Mr. Hankey!  STOP FIGHTING!!
There's only one time of year I can come to the surface, and that's Christmastime. That's why I need you boys to go for me. 
...Now come on, son. Don't be so down.
Cornwallis, we've got to go fix up the drive-in.
It's my fault. All my fault. I got everyone's hopes up.
Well, I've got a loong night ahead of me.  Bye-bye and Merry Christmas 
We need to see Santa right away on urgent Christmas business.
I know, Kyle. I've just been awfully busy with my family.  Honey!
Well, oh boy, that was a super song! And now, let's hear from the school teacher, Mr. Garrison.
Now you put that vase down! Put that vase down! That's a very expensive vase!  Don't you throw that vase! 
Oh. I, I see. Welluh shucks, Kyle, I can't thank you enough for tryin' 
You should be wearing socks to sleep, Kyle.  You're gonna catch a cold.
Good luck, Kyle. And we'll have that projector workin'! Don't you worry! 
Honey, can we go inside for a second?  Well, it's decided, kids. Tomorrow we're gonna bring back the spirit of Christmas!
Santa's loaded up his sleigh
flying around his merry way...
Boy, things are starting to look Christmasy now!
Golly, that sure was swell. I'd say my Christmas special is going super-fantastic. Well, now it's time to hear from perhaps the two most important people of the whole season.
Aw I can't. The sun'll dry me out.
Aw, it's too late for that, son. everyone' gone home. And I don't know nothin' about projectors. I'm just a stupid piece of crap.
Come on, gang, don't fight.  You people focus so hard on the things wrong with Christmas that you've forgotten what's so right about it.  Don't you see?  This is the one time of year we're s'posed to forget all the bad stuff, to stop worrying and being sad about the state of the world, and for just one day say, "Aw, the heck with it!  Let's sing and dance and bake cookies" 
It certainly doesn't seem very Christmasy of them.
I couldn't have done it without you, Kyle.  Kisses. 
Well, I guess that's about the end of my Christmas album. Gosh! It was sure nice hangin' out with y'all again. Well, I guess if there's just... one thing I have left to say, it would be this:
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
May your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight.
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay. 
From now on, our troubles will be miles away.
Oh, I just got a little cold is all. All these new people in South Park are stressful on my home.
Boys, I want you to meet my wife. Autumn.
Don't forget to change your sheets once a week! 
HOWDY HO!
I'm Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
Season's greetings to all of you.
Let's sing songs and dance and play 
Now, before I melt away 
Here's a game I like to play:
Stick me in your mouth and try to say,
Autumn, you're drunk. Alright, now, just go help the other kids; they can't get their stockings up.
Kyle. Be-fore I go there's something I must tell you. Come clo-ser.  Clo-ser.
It's completely destroyed! There's nothin' I can do!
Closer!  One time, when you were sleeping, I put myself in your mouth and had my friend take a picture. 
Howdy-ho, folks. We're gonna do somethin' a little bit different tonight. Instead of our normal thing, we're just gonna sit back and enjoy some holiday songs. And if ya don't like it, well, I guess you can suck my tiny little balls. So let's start off with a festive Hanukkah song, sung by my favorite Jewish person in the whole world.
