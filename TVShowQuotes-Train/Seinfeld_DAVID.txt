Oh, he's ruined it for me.
Oh, hi, Jerry.
Just had our third anniversary on April 8th
No, let's go in.
Wow that's so touching
Excuse me Mr. Dalrimple. I am so sorry.
(interrupting) George please, please I'm fine.
How do you feel?
David Richardson.
Then what is it?
Well, that's easy for you to say.
What kind of car is it?
Good!
But Mr. Dalrimple--
Uh-huh.
You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew you. All you told me about was the ending.
Oh fiance. Boy you coulda done a lot better than him. (Susan laughs) Come on Elaine lets go.
(Mad) You know as far as I'm concerned, this whole thing is George's fault
Whatever. I don't even do it.
I can't do the move.
Hi George
What move?
Something the matter?
(Looking in through the window) Hey it's George
No, he called me a hack. I'm just not into doing it anymore.
All together, that could run about sixteen hundred.
Hello. So, George, uh, you're the one who works for the Yankees, right?
Bad gasket?
What is all this?
Yeah.
All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, you take *that* out of town.
I'll come up with some new stuff.
Well, I sell insurance, but Beth used to be Don Mattingly's doctor.
(very sad) right
Oh, that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it out anyway. I didn't need you to tell me that stupid twist.
No, I'm sorry.
What?
I don't know. Maybe five hundred.
Am I happy Beth left me? Of course not. Do I hope to pick up the pieces and move on? Absolutely
Excuse me. (answers the door) Beth
Yeah, that's right.
