Well, I sell insurance, but Beth used to be Don Mattingly's doctor.
Something the matter?
Oh fiance. Boy you coulda done a lot better than him. (Susan laughs) Come on Elaine lets go.
(Mad) You know as far as I'm concerned, this whole thing is George's fault
(very sad) right
I'll come up with some new stuff.
No, let's go in.
Sure.
You're Jerry right?
(Looking in through the window) Hey it's George
(interrupting) George please, please I'm fine.
Excuse me. (answers the door) Beth
Oh, hi, Jerry.
Excuse me Mr. Dalrimple. I am so sorry.
Am I happy Beth left me? Of course not. Do I hope to pick up the pieces and move on? Absolutely
David Richardson.
Hello. So, George, uh, you're the one who works for the Yankees, right?
Wow that's so touching
Yeah.
I can't do the move.
Yeah, that's right.
I don't know. Maybe five hundred.
How do you feel?
What?
Just had our third anniversary on April 8th
No, I'm sorry.
All together, that could run about sixteen hundred.
Oh, he's ruined it for me.
Whatever. I don't even do it.
What kind of car is it?
Then what is it?
Elaine, here's to you being there.
Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work.
Oh, that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it out anyway. I didn't need you to tell me that stupid twist.
You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew you. All you told me about was the ending.
Uh-huh.
Hi George
What is all this?
But Mr. Dalrimple--
Well, that's easy for you to say.
No, he called me a hack. I'm just not into doing it anymore.
