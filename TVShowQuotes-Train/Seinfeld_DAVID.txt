Am I happy Beth left me? Of course not. Do I hope to pick up the pieces and move on? Absolutely
Hi George
What kind of car is it?
Elaine, here's to you being there.
Then what is it?
(Mad) You know as far as I'm concerned, this whole thing is George's fault
David Richardson.
Yeah, that's right.
Oh, he's ruined it for me.
You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew you. All you told me about was the ending.
Oh, that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it out anyway. I didn't need you to tell me that stupid twist.
Oh, hi, Jerry.
Excuse me Mr. Dalrimple. I am so sorry.
(interrupting) George please, please I'm fine.
Whatever. I don't even do it.
But Mr. Dalrimple--
What move?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't know. Maybe five hundred.
All together, that could run about sixteen hundred.
Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work.
Well, that's easy for you to say.
Well, I sell insurance, but Beth used to be Don Mattingly's doctor.
Uh-huh.
You're Jerry right?
I can't do the move.
(Looking in through the window) Hey it's George
No, let's go in.
Just had our third anniversary on April 8th
What is all this?
Wow that's so touching
Oh fiance. Boy you coulda done a lot better than him. (Susan laughs) Come on Elaine lets go.
Good!
How do you feel?
Sure.
What?
I'll come up with some new stuff.
Hello. So, George, uh, you're the one who works for the Yankees, right?
Yeah.
All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, you take *that* out of town.
Bad gasket?
