I can't do the move.
Then what is it?
You're Jerry right?
(Mad) You know as far as I'm concerned, this whole thing is George's fault
Hello. So, George, uh, you're the one who works for the Yankees, right?
(interrupting) George please, please I'm fine.
Whatever. I don't even do it.
Excuse me. (answers the door) Beth
Something the matter?
Elaine, here's to you being there.
Yeah.
David Richardson.
Good!
I don't know. Maybe five hundred.
Wow that's so touching
Sure.
Oh, that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it out anyway. I didn't need you to tell me that stupid twist.
Excuse me Mr. Dalrimple. I am so sorry.
What is all this?
Oh, he's ruined it for me.
Hi George
What kind of car is it?
How do you feel?
All together, that could run about sixteen hundred.
Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work.
You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew you. All you told me about was the ending.
Just had our third anniversary on April 8th
Well, that's easy for you to say.
I'll come up with some new stuff.
All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, you take *that* out of town.
Yeah, that's right.
Am I happy Beth left me? Of course not. Do I hope to pick up the pieces and move on? Absolutely
(very sad) right
Uh-huh.
What?
(Looking in through the window) Hey it's George
No, let's go in.
Oh fiance. Boy you coulda done a lot better than him. (Susan laughs) Come on Elaine lets go.
No, I'm sorry.
Oh, hi, Jerry.
Well, I sell insurance, but Beth used to be Don Mattingly's doctor.
