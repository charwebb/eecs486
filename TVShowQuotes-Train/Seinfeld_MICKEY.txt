Sorry buddy, this is the "Hamlet" of diseases. Severe pain, nausea, delusions, it's got everything.
Oh Hi Kramer. What do you want, I'm a little busy.
Wait a second, wait a second, you got me all wrong. It was all because of the kid. (numerous little people begin to crowd around them) (to Tammy) The kid was growing. He shot up two and a half inches in a month. (to all the little people) I woulda lost my job. Any one of you would have done the same. You got no right! I'm Mickey Abbott! I stood in for Punky Bruster when all of you was nothing. (seeing the crowd still doesn't agree with what he did, he points at Kramer) It's all his fault. (Kramer acts like he doesn't know what Mickey is talking about) It was his idea.
Hey Jerry.
I told you we should've gotten here a half hour early.
I offered him cigarettes, (to Jerry and George) but his stupid mother is hanging around. She won't let him have any.
Oh, he's always been jealous of me. I always get to stand in for the bigger stars; The Cosby Kids, Ricky Schroder, Macaulay Culkin.
So you can't get Corned Beef?
Don't listen to him Kramer, you've got a good job here.
All right, don't panic. Let's just decide now. Which one do you want?
So, Bradley. I guess this is the last place you expected to find yourself.
I knew you wanted her. That's who I wanted.
(slamming the door) That little Bastard! He saw the lifts in my shoes. He knows I'm heightening. (to Kramer) This never would have happened if you hadn't pushed me to get those things. I told you.
Nah, rock flies right through paper.
Rock
Pleasure.
Hey Tammy.
Hey Jerry.
Rock, paper, scissors match.
(to Jerry then both Jerry and George) But I got a big problem. The kid I stand in for, he's growing. He was four feet last month, now he's like four-two and a half. He shot up two and a half inches. I can do four-two, four-three is a stretch, any higher than that and I'm gonna be out on my ass doing that para-legal crap.
How about lunch?
All of a sudden.
We'll look like idiots. (They exit)
That's it, it's go time! (Charges toward Kramer, only to be held back by Jerry and Elaine)
Hey Jerry. Where's Kramer? I've got exciting news.
Hey, kid, quiet. Were did a nice little boy like you learn such a bad word like that? Huh?
Watch it!
Let's just put they're names in a hat.
Why not? What the hell are you talking about?
Not for you! Who holds a door open for a man?
AH!
Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice! Alright I get to wear make-up! What did you get?
(almost starts to laugh) Bradley! (looking to the crowd) It's very important that you sit down (Kramer still trying to sit down) Now for the last time, (angry) Try again to Sit Down! (Running at Kramer with his arms in the air) Sit down you big stupid Ape! (Mickey tackles Kramer)
That's not bad.
Kramer
There is no break.
I knew that Commie stuff was going to get us in trouble.
He doesn't have to say anything, he just has to sit there. I'm playing a detective.
I got two kids in college.
They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. It's an easy gig.
Look, you take that commie crap out into the street.
Hey! That's my cirrhosis! He's stealing my cirrhosis! (he jumps Kramer) You wanna be sick? I'll make you sick.
So what if I want to open up a delicatessen?
(To Beth) How many is that for you?
Yeah, why should we knock ourselves out?
HUAAHHH!!
(turns and moves up to George, points his finger at him) It's little people, you got that?
What? Now? I can't
Wait, wait (goes to grab her arm)
HUAAHHH!!
What am I gonna do in here?
We're double dating tonight, and if we wear the same shirt we'll look like idiots.
I'm not sure she was my type.
If you had gotten into the backseat of the car we could've figured this whole thing out.
Oh alright, alright. I'll be right over.
Wait a minute. You are doing gonorrhea, aren't you?
Why not?
No, no one wears the shirt next time.
Come on get your bead on. We're going to be late.
Ah! (pauses for the hug) Alright (Kramer still holding on) Alright! Kramer! (pushes Kramer off him)
What the hell does that mean?
I got my hair cut that's all (turns to look at Kramer)
Bacterial Meningitis. Jackpot!
How you doin' Johnny?
(to Kramer) Out of the question.
So Tammy, finally, today's our big lunch.
Well we're gonna be here a while so take a seat. (Kramer starts trying to sit down, Mickey has his back to him and gets out a pack of cigarettes, Mickey then turns around once he has his cigarette to find Kramer struggling to sit down) You know if it hadn't been for that secretary of yours...I said sit down! (Kramer still trying to sit down, Mickey throws the pack of cigarettes to the floor) Are you deaf Bradley?! I said sit down!
Rock, paper, scissors match.
Ya but..
(in complete disgust as seeing Tammy leave with Johnny) AH! (turns and looks at Kramer) AH!
Lets not even talk about it.
Oh, thank you. It's 100 cotton, and some wool.
Hey Bob. What's with you? You gotta problem? (to Kramer) You see that look he gave me? (starts to get up to go after him)
You gave me gonorrhea, you didn't even tell me!
(tugs on Kramer's coat) Don't go Daddy, don't...go.
(stands up) Sorry my scene partner isn't here yet so I guess uh..(Kramer enters and runs into some chairs) Oh
(quietly talking to Kramer) What's with the jeans you're supposed to be a business man
Ya well just keep out of my business you big ape. (pushes Kramer)
I'm sorry Kramer.
Rock, paper, scissors match.
Alright, rock beats paper.
Rock, paper, scissors match.
(phone rings, sighs, answers) Hello?
Maybe. What's it to you?
(looks at Kramer) Not that I know of.
Oh, my liver! Why did I drink all those years? Why did I look for love in a bottle?
Kramer's going to be my scene partner.
(looks at his hand) Nothing beats rock.
Karen and I are getting married.
He's a good kid.
Yeah, well I'm wearin' it.
Communism, You didn't realize Communism was a sensitive issue? What do you think has been going on in the world for the past 60 years? Wake up and smell the coffee.
Goodnight
Well just get up there
Aah-choo.
Hey Tammy.
Yeah, right!. On Prancer, on Dancer, on Donna, on Ethyl, on Harriet.
What does that mean?
Santa is not a Commie. He just forgot how his good friend stuck his neck out for him to get him a good job like this. Didn't he Santa!
I like Merlot.
You're a lightweight. Come on, honey.
(to Kramer) Johnny Vigiano went through my locker.
Ya!
Rock.
You don't, you got the same ugly mug since the day I met ya.
Quiet.
No, no, you think I'm fallin' for that? I'll take Karen.
