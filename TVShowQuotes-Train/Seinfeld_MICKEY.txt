Oh, thank you. It's 100 cotton, and some wool.
Wait a minute. You are doing gonorrhea, aren't you?
Yeah, right!. On Prancer, on Dancer, on Donna, on Ethyl, on Harriet.
If you had gotten into the backseat of the car we could've figured this whole thing out.
Oh, my liver! Why did I drink all those years? Why did I look for love in a bottle?
I knew you wanted her. That's who I wanted.
(slamming the door) That little Bastard! He saw the lifts in my shoes. He knows I'm heightening. (to Kramer) This never would have happened if you hadn't pushed me to get those things. I told you.
Sorry buddy, this is the "Hamlet" of diseases. Severe pain, nausea, delusions, it's got everything.
(looks at Kramer) Not that I know of.
I got my hair cut that's all (turns to look at Kramer)
Not for you! Who holds a door open for a man?
That's it, it's go time! (Charges toward Kramer, only to be held back by Jerry and Elaine)
Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice! Alright I get to wear make-up! What did you get?
I knew that Commie stuff was going to get us in trouble.
(quickly with no acting) How long you going to be away for Daddy?
He doesn't have to say anything, he just has to sit there. I'm playing a detective.
Oh, he's always been jealous of me. I always get to stand in for the bigger stars; The Cosby Kids, Ricky Schroder, Macaulay Culkin.
Why not? What the hell are you talking about?
You don't understand. There's an unwritten code about this kind of thing. I could be ostracized. I remember when I was a kid, some guy tried to heighten. He lost his job, lost his friends, Everything. Oh, I knew I was crazy to try this kind of thing, but I was so desperate. (pauses laying on the couch; jumps up) What is this kid taking anyway? Hormones? Steroids? Would you tell me!?
I offered him cigarettes, (to Jerry and George) but his stupid mother is hanging around. She won't let him have any.
(to Kramer) Johnny Vigiano went through my locker.
Ya well just keep out of my business you big ape. (pushes Kramer)
So, Bradley. I guess this is the last place you expected to find yourself.
I'm very nervous. I'm auditioning to be in the Actor's Studio tonight.
You don't, you got the same ugly mug since the day I met ya.
They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. It's an easy gig.
You gave me gonorrhea, you didn't even tell me!
(turns and moves up to George, points his finger at him) It's little people, you got that?
Oh Hi Kramer. What do you want, I'm a little busy.
All right, don't panic. Let's just decide now. Which one do you want?
No, no, you think I'm fallin' for that? I'll take Karen.
So what if I want to open up a delicatessen?
Lifts?! Look Kramer you don't understand, this kind of thing is just not done.
Hey Bob. What's with you? You gotta problem? (to Kramer) You see that look he gave me? (starts to get up to go after him)
(to Jerry then both Jerry and George) But I got a big problem. The kid I stand in for, he's growing. He was four feet last month, now he's like four-two and a half. He shot up two and a half inches. I can do four-two, four-three is a stretch, any higher than that and I'm gonna be out on my ass doing that para-legal crap.
(stands up) Sorry my scene partner isn't here yet so I guess uh..(Kramer enters and runs into some chairs) Oh
(quietly talking to Kramer) What's with the jeans you're supposed to be a business man
Well we're gonna be here a while so take a seat. (Kramer starts trying to sit down, Mickey has his back to him and gets out a pack of cigarettes, Mickey then turns around once he has his cigarette to find Kramer struggling to sit down) You know if it hadn't been for that secretary of yours...I said sit down! (Kramer still trying to sit down, Mickey throws the pack of cigarettes to the floor) Are you deaf Bradley?! I said sit down!
(tugs on Kramer's coat) Don't go Daddy, don't...go.
(To Beth) How many is that for you?
Ah! (pauses for the hug) Alright (Kramer still holding on) Alright! Kramer! (pushes Kramer off him)
Why don't you just cut the stupid pants and get them off already/
Hey, kid, quiet. Were did a nice little boy like you learn such a bad word like that? Huh?
Come on get your bead on. We're going to be late.
(almost starts to laugh) Bradley! (looking to the crowd) It's very important that you sit down (Kramer still trying to sit down) Now for the last time, (angry) Try again to Sit Down! (Running at Kramer with his arms in the air) Sit down you big stupid Ape! (Mickey tackles Kramer)
No, no one wears the shirt next time.
Look, you take that commie crap out into the street.
Hey! That's my cirrhosis! He's stealing my cirrhosis! (he jumps Kramer) You wanna be sick? I'll make you sick.
(in complete disgust as seeing Tammy leave with Johnny) AH! (turns and looks at Kramer) AH!
We're double dating tonight, and if we wear the same shirt we'll look like idiots.
I told you we should've gotten here a half hour early.
Hey Jerry. Where's Kramer? I've got exciting news.
