Ya!
You don't, you got the same ugly mug since the day I met ya.
(stands up) Sorry my scene partner isn't here yet so I guess uh..(Kramer enters and runs into some chairs) Oh
I like Merlot.
Yeah, why should we knock ourselves out?
(turns and moves up to George, points his finger at him) It's little people, you got that?
Communism, You didn't realize Communism was a sensitive issue? What do you think has been going on in the world for the past 60 years? Wake up and smell the coffee.
I got two kids in college.
Oh alright, alright. I'll be right over.
Ya but..
I knew that Commie stuff was going to get us in trouble.
All of a sudden.
How you doin' Johnny?
If you had gotten into the backseat of the car we could've figured this whole thing out.
(tugs on Kramer's coat) Don't go Daddy, don't...go.
How about lunch?
So, Bradley. I guess this is the last place you expected to find yourself.
Alright, rock beats paper.
Maybe. What's it to you?
Bacterial Meningitis. Jackpot!
You don't understand. There's an unwritten code about this kind of thing. I could be ostracized. I remember when I was a kid, some guy tried to heighten. He lost his job, lost his friends, Everything. Oh, I knew I was crazy to try this kind of thing, but I was so desperate. (pauses laying on the couch; jumps up) What is this kid taking anyway? Hormones? Steroids? Would you tell me!?
They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. It's an easy gig.
Rock.
Yeah, well I'm wearin' it.
You (grabs Kramer)
What the hell does that mean?
I'm sorry Kramer.
(to Kramer) Johnny Vigiano went through my locker.
Not Donna, it's Donner.
Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice! Alright I get to wear make-up! What did you get?
Rock.
Not for you! Who holds a door open for a man?
I'm not sure she was my type.
Pleasure.
AH!
Oh, my liver! Why did I drink all those years? Why did I look for love in a bottle?
Aah-choo.
Karen and I are getting married.
I told you we should've gotten here a half hour early.
Lets not even talk about it.
Goodnight
(phone rings, sighs, answers) Hello?
(looks at his hand) Nothing beats rock.
Oh Hi Kramer. What do you want, I'm a little busy.
Yeah, right!. On Prancer, on Dancer, on Donna, on Ethyl, on Harriet.
Come on get your bead on. We're going to be late.
Santa is not a Commie. He just forgot how his good friend stuck his neck out for him to get him a good job like this. Didn't he Santa!
Watch it!
You sure did. Big time.
No, no one wears the shirt next time.
So what if I want to open up a delicatessen?
You gave me gonorrhea, you didn't even tell me!
Hey Bob. What's with you? You gotta problem? (to Kramer) You see that look he gave me? (starts to get up to go after him)
Ya well just keep out of my business you big ape. (pushes Kramer)
He's a good kid.
Rock, paper, scissors match.
I'm very nervous. I'm auditioning to be in the Actor's Studio tonight.
(almost starts to laugh) Bradley! (looking to the crowd) It's very important that you sit down (Kramer still trying to sit down) Now for the last time, (angry) Try again to Sit Down! (Running at Kramer with his arms in the air) Sit down you big stupid Ape! (Mickey tackles Kramer)
HUAAHHH!!
No, no, you think I'm fallin' for that? I'll take Karen.
Rock, paper, scissors match.
So Tammy, finally, today's our big lunch.
(looks at Kramer) Not that I know of.
That was quick! Nice job, Santa!
Ah! (pauses for the hug) Alright (Kramer still holding on) Alright! Kramer! (pushes Kramer off him)
We're double dating tonight, and if we wear the same shirt we'll look like idiots.
Rock, paper, scissors match.
What am I gonna do in here?
All right, don't panic. Let's just decide now. Which one do you want?
Why don't you just cut the stupid pants and get them off already/
Hey! That's my cirrhosis! He's stealing my cirrhosis! (he jumps Kramer) You wanna be sick? I'll make you sick.
That's not bad.
We'll look like idiots. (They exit)
Wait a second, wait a second, you got me all wrong. It was all because of the kid. (numerous little people begin to crowd around them) (to Tammy) The kid was growing. He shot up two and a half inches in a month. (to all the little people) I woulda lost my job. Any one of you would have done the same. You got no right! I'm Mickey Abbott! I stood in for Punky Bruster when all of you was nothing. (seeing the crowd still doesn't agree with what he did, he points at Kramer) It's all his fault. (Kramer acts like he doesn't know what Mickey is talking about) It was his idea.
Kramer
Nah, rock flies right through paper.
Wait, wait (goes to grab her arm)
I got my hair cut that's all (turns to look at Kramer)
(in complete disgust as seeing Tammy leave with Johnny) AH! (turns and looks at Kramer) AH!
Don't listen to him Kramer, you've got a good job here.
Look, you take that commie crap out into the street.
Sorry buddy, this is the "Hamlet" of diseases. Severe pain, nausea, delusions, it's got everything.
(slamming the door) That little Bastard! He saw the lifts in my shoes. He knows I'm heightening. (to Kramer) This never would have happened if you hadn't pushed me to get those things. I told you.
Oh, thank you. It's 100 cotton, and some wool.
You're a lightweight. Come on, honey.
Hey Tammy.
Hey Jerry.
I offered him cigarettes, (to Jerry and George) but his stupid mother is hanging around. She won't let him have any.
(to Jerry then both Jerry and George) But I got a big problem. The kid I stand in for, he's growing. He was four feet last month, now he's like four-two and a half. He shot up two and a half inches. I can do four-two, four-three is a stretch, any higher than that and I'm gonna be out on my ass doing that para-legal crap.
Oh, he's always been jealous of me. I always get to stand in for the bigger stars; The Cosby Kids, Ricky Schroder, Macaulay Culkin.
Let's just put they're names in a hat.
(quickly with no acting) How long you going to be away for Daddy?
Rock, paper, scissors match.
Quiet.
That's it, it's go time! (Charges toward Kramer, only to be held back by Jerry and Elaine)
Kramer's going to be my scene partner.
(to Kramer) Out of the question.
There is no break.
HUAAHHH!!
Hey Tammy.
Why not? What the hell are you talking about?
What does that mean?
What? Now? I can't
Hey Jerry. Where's Kramer? I've got exciting news.
He doesn't have to say anything, he just has to sit there. I'm playing a detective.
Right, the rage. Tons of rage.
Hey Jerry.
