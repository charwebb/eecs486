So what if I want to open up a delicatessen?
Sorry buddy, this is the "Hamlet" of diseases. Severe pain, nausea, delusions, it's got everything.
Oh alright, alright. I'll be right over.
(tugs on Kramer's coat) Don't go Daddy, don't...go.
They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. It's an easy gig.
Wait a minute. You are doing gonorrhea, aren't you?
That's not bad.
We're double dating tonight, and if we wear the same shirt we'll look like idiots.
(slamming the door) That little Bastard! He saw the lifts in my shoes. He knows I'm heightening. (to Kramer) This never would have happened if you hadn't pushed me to get those things. I told you.
Right, the rage. Tons of rage.
So Tammy, finally, today's our big lunch.
Rock, paper, scissors match.
Hey Jerry.
Let's just put they're names in a hat.
Communism, You didn't realize Communism was a sensitive issue? What do you think has been going on in the world for the past 60 years? Wake up and smell the coffee.
Oh, he's always been jealous of me. I always get to stand in for the bigger stars; The Cosby Kids, Ricky Schroder, Macaulay Culkin.
Nah, rock flies right through paper.
All of a sudden.
Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice! Alright I get to wear make-up! What did you get?
Quiet.
What? Now? I can't
(stands up) Sorry my scene partner isn't here yet so I guess uh..(Kramer enters and runs into some chairs) Oh
If you had gotten into the backseat of the car we could've figured this whole thing out.
(to Kramer) Out of the question.
That's it, it's go time! (Charges toward Kramer, only to be held back by Jerry and Elaine)
What the hell does that mean?
Hey! That's my cirrhosis! He's stealing my cirrhosis! (he jumps Kramer) You wanna be sick? I'll make you sick.
Watch it!
(quietly talking to Kramer) What's with the jeans you're supposed to be a business man
So, Bradley. I guess this is the last place you expected to find yourself.
I told you we should've gotten here a half hour early.
All right, don't panic. Let's just decide now. Which one do you want?
Maybe. What's it to you?
Hey Jerry. Where's Kramer? I've got exciting news.
No, no, you think I'm fallin' for that? I'll take Karen.
Why not?
(almost starts to laugh) Bradley! (looking to the crowd) It's very important that you sit down (Kramer still trying to sit down) Now for the last time, (angry) Try again to Sit Down! (Running at Kramer with his arms in the air) Sit down you big stupid Ape! (Mickey tackles Kramer)
Rock.
AH!
Why don't you just cut the stupid pants and get them off already/
Goodnight
Yeah, well I'm wearin' it.
(in complete disgust as seeing Tammy leave with Johnny) AH! (turns and looks at Kramer) AH!
What does that mean?
Not for you! Who holds a door open for a man?
(looks at Kramer) Not that I know of.
Wait, wait (goes to grab her arm)
No, no one wears the shirt next time.
I knew that Commie stuff was going to get us in trouble.
I knew you wanted her. That's who I wanted.
I'm very nervous. I'm auditioning to be in the Actor's Studio tonight.
Rock, paper, scissors match.
Ya!
Don't listen to him Kramer, you've got a good job here.
Well we're gonna be here a while so take a seat. (Kramer starts trying to sit down, Mickey has his back to him and gets out a pack of cigarettes, Mickey then turns around once he has his cigarette to find Kramer struggling to sit down) You know if it hadn't been for that secretary of yours...I said sit down! (Kramer still trying to sit down, Mickey throws the pack of cigarettes to the floor) Are you deaf Bradley?! I said sit down!
What am I gonna do in here?
(quickly with no acting) How long you going to be away for Daddy?
Ah! (pauses for the hug) Alright (Kramer still holding on) Alright! Kramer! (pushes Kramer off him)
Well just get up there
Wait a second, wait a second, you got me all wrong. It was all because of the kid. (numerous little people begin to crowd around them) (to Tammy) The kid was growing. He shot up two and a half inches in a month. (to all the little people) I woulda lost my job. Any one of you would have done the same. You got no right! I'm Mickey Abbott! I stood in for Punky Bruster when all of you was nothing. (seeing the crowd still doesn't agree with what he did, he points at Kramer) It's all his fault. (Kramer acts like he doesn't know what Mickey is talking about) It was his idea.
Hey Tammy.
You're a lightweight. Come on, honey.
I got my hair cut that's all (turns to look at Kramer)
Pleasure.
He's a good kid.
You (grabs Kramer)
Lets not even talk about it.
I offered him cigarettes, (to Jerry and George) but his stupid mother is hanging around. She won't let him have any.
Oh, thank you. It's 100 cotton, and some wool.
(phone rings, sighs, answers) Hello?
Ya well just keep out of my business you big ape. (pushes Kramer)
HUAAHHH!!
You sure did. Big time.
Alright, rock beats paper.
That was quick! Nice job, Santa!
He doesn't have to say anything, he just has to sit there. I'm playing a detective.
Yeah, right!. On Prancer, on Dancer, on Donna, on Ethyl, on Harriet.
I like Merlot.
I'm sorry Kramer.
Santa is not a Commie. He just forgot how his good friend stuck his neck out for him to get him a good job like this. Didn't he Santa!
I got two kids in college.
How you doin' Johnny?
Aah-choo.
Yeah, why should we knock ourselves out?
How about lunch?
Hey Jerry.
Hey Tammy.
So you can't get Corned Beef?
(looks at his hand) Nothing beats rock.
(to Kramer) Johnny Vigiano went through my locker.
Rock, paper, scissors match.
HUAAHHH!!
(turns and moves up to George, points his finger at him) It's little people, you got that?
Bacterial Meningitis. Jackpot!
I'm not sure she was my type.
Oh, my liver! Why did I drink all those years? Why did I look for love in a bottle?
Rock
Hey, kid, quiet. Were did a nice little boy like you learn such a bad word like that? Huh?
Not Donna, it's Donner.
Why not? What the hell are you talking about?
You don't, you got the same ugly mug since the day I met ya.
(to Jerry then both Jerry and George) But I got a big problem. The kid I stand in for, he's growing. He was four feet last month, now he's like four-two and a half. He shot up two and a half inches. I can do four-two, four-three is a stretch, any higher than that and I'm gonna be out on my ass doing that para-legal crap.
You gave me gonorrhea, you didn't even tell me!
Rock, paper, scissors match.
Karen and I are getting married.
Come on get your bead on. We're going to be late.
Ya but..
