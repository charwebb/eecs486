So what if I want to open up a delicatessen?
If you had gotten into the backseat of the car we could've figured this whole thing out.
Sorry buddy, this is the "Hamlet" of diseases. Severe pain, nausea, delusions, it's got everything.
So, Bradley. I guess this is the last place you expected to find yourself.
Oh, he's always been jealous of me. I always get to stand in for the bigger stars; The Cosby Kids, Ricky Schroder, Macaulay Culkin.
Oh, my liver! Why did I drink all those years? Why did I look for love in a bottle?
Wait a minute. You are doing gonorrhea, aren't you?
No, no, you think I'm fallin' for that? I'll take Karen.
He doesn't have to say anything, he just has to sit there. I'm playing a detective.
Come on get your bead on. We're going to be late.
(To Beth) How many is that for you?
(almost starts to laugh) Bradley! (looking to the crowd) It's very important that you sit down (Kramer still trying to sit down) Now for the last time, (angry) Try again to Sit Down! (Running at Kramer with his arms in the air) Sit down you big stupid Ape! (Mickey tackles Kramer)
I'm very nervous. I'm auditioning to be in the Actor's Studio tonight.
Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice! Alright I get to wear make-up! What did you get?
I knew that Commie stuff was going to get us in trouble.
(stands up) Sorry my scene partner isn't here yet so I guess uh..(Kramer enters and runs into some chairs) Oh
Yeah, right!. On Prancer, on Dancer, on Donna, on Ethyl, on Harriet.
Hey! That's my cirrhosis! He's stealing my cirrhosis! (he jumps Kramer) You wanna be sick? I'll make you sick.
Hey, kid, quiet. Were did a nice little boy like you learn such a bad word like that? Huh?
Ah! (pauses for the hug) Alright (Kramer still holding on) Alright! Kramer! (pushes Kramer off him)
Look, you take that commie crap out into the street.
Lifts?! Look Kramer you don't understand, this kind of thing is just not done.
You don't understand. There's an unwritten code about this kind of thing. I could be ostracized. I remember when I was a kid, some guy tried to heighten. He lost his job, lost his friends, Everything. Oh, I knew I was crazy to try this kind of thing, but I was so desperate. (pauses laying on the couch; jumps up) What is this kid taking anyway? Hormones? Steroids? Would you tell me!?
You gave me gonorrhea, you didn't even tell me!
I got my hair cut that's all (turns to look at Kramer)
Let's just put they're names in a hat.
(looks at Kramer) Not that I know of.
Ya well just keep out of my business you big ape. (pushes Kramer)
Wait a second, wait a second, you got me all wrong. It was all because of the kid. (numerous little people begin to crowd around them) (to Tammy) The kid was growing. He shot up two and a half inches in a month. (to all the little people) I woulda lost my job. Any one of you would have done the same. You got no right! I'm Mickey Abbott! I stood in for Punky Bruster when all of you was nothing. (seeing the crowd still doesn't agree with what he did, he points at Kramer) It's all his fault. (Kramer acts like he doesn't know what Mickey is talking about) It was his idea.
That's it, it's go time! (Charges toward Kramer, only to be held back by Jerry and Elaine)
(quickly with no acting) How long you going to be away for Daddy?
You don't, you got the same ugly mug since the day I met ya.
All right, don't panic. Let's just decide now. Which one do you want?
Don't listen to him Kramer, you've got a good job here.
I knew you wanted her. That's who I wanted.
I offered him cigarettes, (to Jerry and George) but his stupid mother is hanging around. She won't let him have any.
I told you we should've gotten here a half hour early.
(tugs on Kramer's coat) Don't go Daddy, don't...go.
Why don't you just cut the stupid pants and get them off already/
We're double dating tonight, and if we wear the same shirt we'll look like idiots.
(in complete disgust as seeing Tammy leave with Johnny) AH! (turns and looks at Kramer) AH!
(turns and moves up to George, points his finger at him) It's little people, you got that?
Oh, thank you. It's 100 cotton, and some wool.
Well we're gonna be here a while so take a seat. (Kramer starts trying to sit down, Mickey has his back to him and gets out a pack of cigarettes, Mickey then turns around once he has his cigarette to find Kramer struggling to sit down) You know if it hadn't been for that secretary of yours...I said sit down! (Kramer still trying to sit down, Mickey throws the pack of cigarettes to the floor) Are you deaf Bradley?! I said sit down!
They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. It's an easy gig.
Why not? What the hell are you talking about?
(slamming the door) That little Bastard! He saw the lifts in my shoes. He knows I'm heightening. (to Kramer) This never would have happened if you hadn't pushed me to get those things. I told you.
(quietly talking to Kramer) What's with the jeans you're supposed to be a business man
Communism, You didn't realize Communism was a sensitive issue? What do you think has been going on in the world for the past 60 years? Wake up and smell the coffee.
Oh Hi Kramer. What do you want, I'm a little busy.
No, no one wears the shirt next time.
Hey Bob. What's with you? You gotta problem? (to Kramer) You see that look he gave me? (starts to get up to go after him)
