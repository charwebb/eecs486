Elaine, Elaine. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
I've taken it. Three times. I almost passed the last one.
I dunno. Dead bodies really gross me out. (Sue Ellen Mischke enters with a man)
Yes, George, the whole breakfast is breathtaking. (hearing this Elaine looks at him extremely annoyed)
I'm sorry, Elaine. I always knew that after I became a doctor, I would dump whoever I was with and find someone better. That's the dream of becoming a doctor.
I'm not afraid of dyin'. I never think about it.
Yeah, he really is breathtaking. (Elaine confused by his comment)
I couldn't tell you. You know, I'm not really a doctor.
It was built by Mark Fargman. He build a lot of these homes here.
Well, you know Elaine, sometimes you say things just to be nice. (Elaine relieved, then confused, not knowing if he was being nice to her or to the baby)
Uh, Sure. (Elaine celebrates to herself as Jerry enters and quickly looks away from the baby)
Well, I'm serious, Elaine. I went to medical school, but I still have to pass my licensing exam.
