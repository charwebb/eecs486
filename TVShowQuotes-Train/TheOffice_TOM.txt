Right! That would be hilarious! We should totally dog her, about being an artist, never making any money!

Hey, you think it's cool if I grab a soda?
Pam, I haven't seen you in so, so long!
Yup. She only knows how to play 'When the Saints go Marching In.'

Hoping it'll make our wives take it up a notch.
