Fishsticks? Yeah, I guess so. 

Hey you guys. 

I admit nothing! Maybe Irene lied to you!

Thanks, everyone. Please tell me that you'll never do that again, Jimmy.

Well it's a pretty fucking stupid law!

Using my laptop computer, I hooked into the Internet and found a meteorology Web site.  I donwloaded the data, and with my dad's video projector, I can show you the graph I made of predictable weather patterns over the next three months. 

Yeah, well, you know, I did a little shopping at J mart.

...No thanks.

Aaaah. Oh, I know. 

I'm not playing anymore. 

Mom? Dad? Why do we have a bigger house than everybody else in South Park? 

I was just thinking the same thing. It's like, she's a girl, but, she's someone you could hang out with.

I am not scared. I'll go inside and watch the tape,  just for a few seconds. If I do not return in two minutes, send a party in after me.  The fate of Middle-earth... is in my hands. 

The cough companies claim they don't intend for their product to be used by kids to get high! But one look at the packaging tells otherwise.  Theradryl DM. For kids.  Dexa Cough, children's formula.

So what?!

I don't know, I don't wanna know. I'm out. 

I'm supposed to be home by 3:30.

Hey, there was a bass guitar in my basement.

All right!  Thanks, God. 

I'd like that.

Yeah, Fatty!

Why can't I be like all the other kids?
They all have three-bedroom homes, broken trucks on their lawns.
And cut-up hot dogs for lunch
It's not my fault my parents succeed so much.
There's no one in town I can relate to.
I play with autographed baseball bats
while everyone else just plays with sticks and pine cones
Has a boy ever felt so alone?
Well, who needs them anyway? I won't pretend to be something I'm not
If I can't be poor, I've got to deal with what I've got.
If I can't be like them, what I need is more rich kids around,
So I'm not the only one, and then I won't be so... down.
Please, God, send more rich kids...
To my...
Town

Sooo black people are midgets. 

How do they eat?

You just don't get it, Stan!

Whoa! Where'd you get those?!

Are you serious?

I'm just so happy you guys moved into town. You see, I used to be the only rich kid. All the other families here are kinda  low to  middle-income.

Jesus, lions suck!

Wow, she's hot.

Yeah, I was watching with my whole family. And then we saw all the replays this morning in the news.

Oh yeah.

She is pissed off.

Come on! Hurry up!  Hey, what are you guys doin'?

Yeah.

Okay good, yeah.

Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?

Oh! Sure, that works.

Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air.

And I am Black Chaku,  with the power of perfect spelling!

What?! How did that happen?

You mean, you want me around?

Well, I'm Token

"Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy." 

That's good, Fatty, get pissed!

No, because there's a spring in there, and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna hurt my finger.

Nuh-uh!

I'm sorry too. I wouldn't even talk to you at first because you were black. 

What the hell is wrong with you?! Why are you all here listening to this?!

Yeah. We need a leader like Bebe. She can teach us all so much.

Yeah. Now that it's over, I.. I guess it was kind of fun. 

I'm out. 

Here comes a sedan. 

Yeah, but don't worry. It didn't do so good. We got killed in the ratings by Honey Boo Boo.

I think, you're really great.

Well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't-

Six!

Oh, come on, guys. You have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me.

But I...

...And when the woman has four penises in her at the same time, then stands over the men and pees on them, is that part of being in love too?  Five midgets, spanking a man... covered in Thousand Island dressing. Is that making love?

Wait! I liked being ripped on for being rich better! 

Oh I see, so I'm supposed to feel all better now.

Oh my God! Okay!

At least then we'd be voicing our concern. I mean, if you think about it, we should feel some shame for... complaining about it and not doing anything.

Jimmy and Eric, it looks like a massive snow storm is headed South Park's way. I asked my dad last night and he said that he heard the snow storm is expected on Tuesday. Guys?

Nothing.

I uhhh, have band practice.

Hey! In here! 

And why does standing your ground not apply to fucking white people?!

Why?! Why are you happy for me?!

Sure!  What's up?

Well, what am I supposed to do?

I don't care, either. 

I don't fit in anywhere.

He's just out looking for trouble.

Uh-oh, looks like it's Panda Bear Madness Minute! 

Thanks, dude.

Oh God, how embarrassing.

Yeah. You're gonna hurt the band.

What are you doing?

...Yeah?

I sure did.

Okay, really?

What did you say?! 

Hi! Welcome to the neighborhood!

He's chubby,  he's filthy , and he's just a little bit nuts.  Here he is, America's newest sweetheart, Fatty Doo Doo! 

...That's ...great.

Well, they never really had any money.

That's it, I'm dead!

Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'll see you around. 

Yeah, Stan!

I'm number two? Wow.

Yeah.

I'm good.

So, what are we doing?

But she's not black, Kyle. She's white.  The bar is determined by society, Kyle. And it's not something that can just be raised up.  Not by us, or anyone else.

You do? God, that's great!

Hi.

What the hell is going on?

Oh. Alright then. 

Come in.

Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television.

It doesn't matter, Mom. They're poor people pants.

God-damnit! 

Whoa.

Hi.

Good job, Butters!

Uh, well, actually it is kind of a big deal, Stan.

I'm sure. 

YAY! 

Roar! 

There are still people who will look at us funny. That think we're supposed to be together.

"If I could be Bebe."  "If I was Bebe I would have lots of friends because I would be sooo great. I would make people smile and think wherever I went."

He doesn't need to know the truth. Kyle will get what he wants, and so will I. 

Are... you... Aslan?

I don't wanna be rich anymore! I wanna eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and, and wear clothes from J mart!

Now you get it, Stan. 

Nothing!

Why?

If you know of a way, wizard, then speak.

Oh.

That's right, huh?

That is a terrific idea, Stan, A-Okay.

I can't help it!

I'm Token.

That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster!

Hey Eric, where's Kyle?

That doesn't mean I can just be fine.

That's easy for you to say, Stan.

Hey Nichole.

You'll never find...As long as you live...Someone who loves you...Tender like I do...

Wow, my plan to get rich people here sure did work. Hey, I got a great idea! Let's all pack some lunches and go sledding.

I can't believe it's him.

Thanks.

Okay.

If somebody kills somebody, it's a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it's a hate crime.

Hey yeah!

Here you go. 

Oh... Hey guys.  What, what are you doin' here?

I know. But why?

Yeah. What the hell happened to us?

Yeah I guess.

Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years of darkness or not?

It may be a mistake, but you don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. So don't say it isn't a big deal.

What the hell?! 

...I like jokes a lot.

No!

Nothin'

You're gonna get it now, Hammerclaw!

I can remember... exactly where I was... the first time I saw Honey Boo Boo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A shameful, fat family eating white trash food to their death. And then I saw what network it was on: The Learning Channel.  If they can feel okay about that, why can't I?

Yes.

Well I... think that.. they...

If you really think it's not a big deal, then you really are ignorant. That's all. I'm not "fighting" anybody. 

... I don't want the code name Blackie.

That's not a blinding device, Dad. It's fluorescent lighting.

Ignoring him? How come?

Pluto is also the furthest planet from the sun, though scientists believe more planets lie beyond it. I hope you enjoyed my report on the Solar System. Thank you. 

Yeah.

No!

Aah, he's a lawyer. I think.

This game is too confusing. How about we have a snowball fight?

This isn't a poem. It doesn't even rhyme.

Base!

Here you go. 

I only have this.

NO.

...What do we do?

Cough medicine?

Oh! 

Yeah, they left.

...And this is the room where my mom and dad keep their original v-Van Gogh painting.

Go Stan!

And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing.

I'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes!

Where is everybody? What's goin' on??

No.

Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are sure to win!

But you spent all the money we made!

Butters!

He's gone!

Send a cress in your plates, folks? 

Why are you involving me in this?

Fuck you, Brad Pitt!

Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television.

Yeah! We should make up a bunch of reports about how dangerous it is to be alive.

It's a DVD of the Lion King

There has to be another way!

You're a guest here! Your mom isn't in charge!

Ginger kids eat in the hallway!

What's a VHS?

Alright, that's enough!  You think I should feel bad for you because of the Trayvon Martin verdict?!

All right! 

Huuuunh  Aslan.

When was the last guy you had a manicure, straight man? 

Yes. Um. Great Aslan. I don't fit in anywhere else.

Huh?

Cartman, what the hell is all this?

I'm gonna start saying that now.

Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness.

Hello, my name is Token. I don't fit in with all the kids at South Park Elementary so, I invited a bunch of rich kids to move to town. The problem is, I don't fit in with them, either. That's why I've come to live with you.  So if you'll have me and raise me as one of your own, I promise to be the best lion I could be.  Uuuh, yeah.

Hey guys.

What?! We don't have a bass guitar.

Come on guys, let's go!

This is my room! I'll take the remote from you!

I also printed out the results on my color printer. Here you are, Ms. Choksondik. 

AAA!

Yeah, we're through.

What are we gonna do?!

It sure was.

Wow, those animals are pretty cute.

We did that!

Why the hell would I be looking way over there??

No, but you can't just pretend it never happened either!

My family isn't rich.

I have every reason to be mad! You just don't get it!

... (you're gonna miss my lovin')I know you're gonna my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my lo-o-ove.

Yeah, you said you had a startup company and that school was for douchebags.

Action News!

Yeah, I know. But you guys always rip on me for bein' rich.

I don't know what to say.

A motion detector. 

...I thnk I'm gonna go home now.

You're right, guys. From now on, I'm fine with being made fun of for being rich.

All the kids at school made fun of me today because I'm rich.

It actually aired last night.

I just wanna be like all the other kids in South Park. Please, Mom and Dad, please. 

Good job, dickhead! You lost the entire audience!

Fuck you!

Oh... Good.

I don't know.

Nothing! 

You made everyone think I'm a fucking Patient Zero!

Come on!  Hey look: there pants are only five bucks apiece. They must really suck. What do ya think?

Oh! 

Who do they say is the ugliest?

Jesse Jackson, is not the emperor, of black people! 

Yeah.

An apology?! He shot me!

What?

So can I stay?

Can I go back to class now?

...What jury?

RRrrr!! 

I helped you make a documentary, Kyle.

Alright! 

Yeah. It was great.

Ow. 

Yeah. Me neither.

Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, babyBut I'm the one who loves youAnd there's no one else! No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh one else.

Those wings don't look very strong.

We were at why I should give you ten percent.
