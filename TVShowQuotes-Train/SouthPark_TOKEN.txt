That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster!
Alright, that's enough!  You think I should feel bad for you because of the Trayvon Martin verdict?!
I have every reason to be mad! You just don't get it!
It may be a mistake, but you don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. So don't say it isn't a big deal.
All the kids at school made fun of me today because I'm rich.
Jimmy and Eric, it looks like a massive snow storm is headed South Park's way. I asked my dad last night and he said that he heard the snow storm is expected on Tuesday. Guys?
We were at why I should give you ten percent.
Come on! Hurry up!  Hey, what are you guys doin'?
There are still people who will look at us funny. That think we're supposed to be together.
That doesn't mean I can just be fine.
Yeah. Now that it's over, I.. I guess it was kind of fun. 
You- you talked. I, I understood you. I must be becoming a lion!
That's not a blinding device, Dad. It's fluorescent lighting.
But you spent all the money we made!
You're right, guys. From now on, I'm fine with being made fun of for being rich.
He doesn't need to know the truth. Kyle will get what he wants, and so will I. 
I was just thinking the same thing. It's like, she's a girl, but, she's someone you could hang out with.
Come on!  Hey look: there pants are only five bucks apiece. They must really suck. What do ya think?
That's the alarm; someone's in the back yard.
What the hell is wrong with you?! Why are you all here listening to this?!
Yeah, I know. But you guys always rip on me for bein' rich.
Well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't-
When was the last guy you had a manicure, straight man? 
And why does standing your ground not apply to fucking white people?!
How do you know? None of us had ever had any drugs before.
Good job, dickhead! You lost the entire audience!
Mom? Dad? Why do we have a bigger house than everybody else in South Park? 
Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are sure to win!
Yeah! We should make up a bunch of reports about how dangerous it is to be alive.
I just wanna be like all the other kids in South Park. Please, Mom and Dad, please. 
Why the hell would I be looking way over there??
This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!
Oh... Hey guys.  What, what are you doin' here?
I don't know, I don't wanna know. I'm out. 
If somebody kills somebody, it's a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it's a hate crime.
Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness.
No tornadoes, Eric, but interestingly enough, there is a low-pressure storm moving in over the Park County Valley. Should bring us some chilly days ahead. 
Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years of darkness or not?
Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television.
Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.  I'm trying to work my way back home.
I can remember... exactly where I was... the first time I saw Honey Boo Boo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A shameful, fat family eating white trash food to their death. And then I saw what network it was on: The Learning Channel.  If they can feel okay about that, why can't I?
Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, babyBut I'm the one who loves youAnd there's no one else! No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh one else.
Will you stop changing channels and just pick something?
I am not scared. I'll go inside and watch the tape,  just for a few seconds. If I do not return in two minutes, send a party in after me.  The fate of Middle-earth... is in my hands. 
Well, yeah, but can't we just play without these uncomfortable uniforms? 
"If I could be Bebe."  "If I was Bebe I would have lots of friends because I would be sooo great. I would make people smile and think wherever I went."
He's chubby,  he's filthy , and he's just a little bit nuts.  Here he is, America's newest sweetheart, Fatty Doo Doo! 
And I am Black Chaku,  with the power of perfect spelling!
At least then we'd be voicing our concern. I mean, if you think about it, we should feel some shame for... complaining about it and not doing anything.
...And when the woman has four penises in her at the same time, then stands over the men and pees on them, is that part of being in love too?  Five midgets, spanking a man... covered in Thousand Island dressing. Is that making love?
Well, I guess that makes sense. All right. 
... I don't want the code name Blackie.
Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. We've got water, and, and maybe somebody even left some food laying around. Come on. 
I'm sorry too. I wouldn't even talk to you at first because you were black. 
Using my laptop computer, I hooked into the Internet and found a meteorology Web site.  I donwloaded the data, and with my dad's video projector, I can show you the graph I made of predictable weather patterns over the next three months. 
Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television.
Oh, come on, guys. You have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me.
I also printed out the results on my color printer. Here you are, Ms. Choksondik. 
I don't wanna be rich anymore! I wanna eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and, and wear clothes from J mart!
Yeah. We need a leader like Bebe. She can teach us all so much.
If you know of a way, wizard, then speak.
You'll never find...As long as you live...Someone who loves you...Tender like I do...
...And this is the room where my mom and dad keep their original v-Van Gogh painting.
Yes. Um. Great Aslan. I don't fit in anywhere else.
It doesn't matter, Mom. They're poor people pants.
And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing.
If you really think it's not a big deal, then you really are ignorant. That's all. I'm not "fighting" anybody. 
Uh, well, actually it is kind of a big deal, Stan.
Hello, my name is Token. I don't fit in with all the kids at South Park Elementary so, I invited a bunch of rich kids to move to town. The problem is, I don't fit in with them, either. That's why I've come to live with you.  So if you'll have me and raise me as one of your own, I promise to be the best lion I could be.  Uuuh, yeah.
I admit nothing! Maybe Irene lied to you!
Pluto is also the furthest planet from the sun, though scientists believe more planets lie beyond it. I hope you enjoyed my report on the Solar System. Thank you. 
Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air.
Yeah, well, you know, I did a little shopping at J mart.
The cough companies claim they don't intend for their product to be used by kids to get high! But one look at the packaging tells otherwise.  Theradryl DM. For kids.  Dexa Cough, children's formula.
You're a guest here! Your mom isn't in charge!
But she's not black, Kyle. She's white.  The bar is determined by society, Kyle. And it's not something that can just be raised up.  Not by us, or anyone else.
This game is too confusing. How about we have a snowball fight?
Wow, my plan to get rich people here sure did work. Hey, I got a great idea! Let's all pack some lunches and go sledding.
Thanks, everyone. Please tell me that you'll never do that again, Jimmy.
Wait! I liked being ripped on for being rich better! 
Yeah, but don't worry. It didn't do so good. We got killed in the ratings by Honey Boo Boo.
Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?
I'm just so happy you guys moved into town. You see, I used to be the only rich kid. All the other families here are kinda  low to  middle-income.
Oh I see, so I'm supposed to feel all better now.
Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'll see you around. 
They do. But, I guess I learned something today. You see, even though kids at South Park make fun of me, I still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or, lions. Even though I may be different from them, I still like my old friends best.
No, because there's a spring in there, and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna hurt my finger.
Jesse Jackson, is not the emperor, of black people! 
You made everyone think I'm a fucking Patient Zero!
