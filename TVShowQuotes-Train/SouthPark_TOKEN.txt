Yeah, we're through.

I can't believe it's finally over. 

Here you go. 

Good job, dickhead! You lost the entire audience!

...And when the woman has four penises in her at the same time, then stands over the men and pees on them, is that part of being in love too?  Five midgets, spanking a man... covered in Thousand Island dressing. Is that making love?

Yeah, you said you had a startup company and that school was for douchebags.

They do. But, I guess I learned something today. You see, even though kids at South Park make fun of me, I still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or, lions. Even though I may be different from them, I still like my old friends best.

I sure did.

Ginger kids eat in the hallway!

What are we gonna do?!

I am not scared. I'll go inside and watch the tape,  just for a few seconds. If I do not return in two minutes, send a party in after me.  The fate of Middle-earth... is in my hands. 

I can remember... exactly where I was... the first time I saw Honey Boo Boo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A shameful, fat family eating white trash food to their death. And then I saw what network it was on: The Learning Channel.  If they can feel okay about that, why can't I?

Send a cress in your plates, folks? 

I can't believe it's him.

I'm Token.

I have every reason to be mad! You just don't get it!

Will you stop changing channels and just pick something?

It actually aired last night.

Why the hell would I be looking way over there??

Oh. Alright then. 

Oh God, how embarrassing.

But what are we gonna do?

Pluto is also the furthest planet from the sun, though scientists believe more planets lie beyond it. I hope you enjoyed my report on the Solar System. Thank you. 

Fuck you, Brad Pitt!

It sure was.

Hey Eric, where's Kyle?

And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing.

...No thanks.

No tornadoes, Eric, but interestingly enough, there is a low-pressure storm moving in over the Park County Valley. Should bring us some chilly days ahead. 

Yeah, Stan!

Wow, my plan to get rich people here sure did work. Hey, I got a great idea! Let's all pack some lunches and go sledding.

Why are you involving me in this?

Come in.

Well, what am I supposed to do?

What are you doing?

Yeah, Fatty!

You'll never find...As long as you live...Someone who loves you...Tender like I do...

Oh.

Hey yeah!

We were at why I should give you ten percent.

Sure!  What's up?

How do they eat?

I don't fit in anywhere.

Yeah, I know. But you guys always rip on me for bein' rich.

I'm out. 

A motion detector. 

But you spent all the money we made!

"If I could be Bebe."  "If I was Bebe I would have lots of friends because I would be sooo great. I would make people smile and think wherever I went."

Here comes a sedan. 

And why does standing your ground not apply to fucking white people?!

I just wanna be like all the other kids in South Park. Please, Mom and Dad, please. 

Huuuunh  Aslan.

That's it, I'm dead!

My family isn't rich.

Well I... think that.. they...

Fishsticks? Yeah, I guess so. 

NO.

That's right, huh?

No!

We did that!

Well, I guess that makes sense. All right. 

Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.  I'm trying to work my way back home.

Whoa! Where'd you get those?!

Those wings don't look very strong.

Well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't-

If you know of a way, wizard, then speak.

Go Stan!

Oh... Hey guys.  What, what are you doin' here?

Hello, my name is Token. I don't fit in with all the kids at South Park Elementary so, I invited a bunch of rich kids to move to town. The problem is, I don't fit in with them, either. That's why I've come to live with you.  So if you'll have me and raise me as one of your own, I promise to be the best lion I could be.  Uuuh, yeah.

Yeah, they left.

Yes.

Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television.

She is pissed off.

Whoa.

I'm sorry too. I wouldn't even talk to you at first because you were black. 

I helped you make a documentary, Kyle.

I don't know.

RRrrr!! 

Alright! 

Oh! 

If you really think it's not a big deal, then you really are ignorant. That's all. I'm not "fighting" anybody. 

Cartman, what the hell is all this?

Yeah.

No!

I think, you're really great.

Okay.

...I thnk I'm gonna go home now.

Wait! I liked being ripped on for being rich better! 

...What jury?

Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness.

But she's not black, Kyle. She's white.  The bar is determined by society, Kyle. And it's not something that can just be raised up.  Not by us, or anyone else.

Yeah. Me neither.

Yeah. You're gonna hurt the band.

Uh, well, actually it is kind of a big deal, Stan.

What the hell is wrong with you?! Why are you all here listening to this?!

I'm just so happy you guys moved into town. You see, I used to be the only rich kid. All the other families here are kinda  low to  middle-income.

It may be a mistake, but you don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. So don't say it isn't a big deal.

He's just out looking for trouble.

Mom? Dad? Why do we have a bigger house than everybody else in South Park? 

I'd like that.

That's not a blinding device, Dad. It's fluorescent lighting.

I'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes!

Good job, Butters!

... (you're gonna miss my lovin')I know you're gonna my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my lo-o-ove.

So, what are we doing?

He's gone!

This isn't a poem. It doesn't even rhyme.

Base!

Oh! Sure, that works.

Hi! Welcome to the neighborhood!

Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years of darkness or not?

That is a terrific idea, Stan, A-Okay.

...What do we do?

How do you know? None of us had ever had any drugs before.

Huh?

Okay...

No!

Using my laptop computer, I hooked into the Internet and found a meteorology Web site.  I donwloaded the data, and with my dad's video projector, I can show you the graph I made of predictable weather patterns over the next three months. 

Nothing.

I don't know how to play bass. 

That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster!

Aw, damn it. 

Yeah, but don't worry. It didn't do so good. We got killed in the ratings by Honey Boo Boo.

Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?

What the-? Damn, baby. 

It's a DVD of the Lion King

You do? God, that's great!

But I...

I'm number two? Wow.

Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are sure to win!

...I like jokes a lot.

Who's Aslan?

Where is everybody? What's goin' on??

I don't know what to say.

What did you say?! 

Cough medicine?

What's a VHS?

Ignoring him? How come?

Come on guys, let's go!

Nothing! 

Wow, those animals are pretty cute.

Oh I see, so I'm supposed to feel all better now.

You mean, you want me around?

Why?! Why are you happy for me?!

Hey, there was a bass guitar in my basement.

Yeah, a turkey that could do tricks.

Here you go. 

That's easy for you to say, Stan.

What?! How did that happen?

What the hell is going on?

Hey Nichole.

Oh... Good.

Yeah I guess.

Roar! 

Jesse Jackson, is not the emperor, of black people! 

Yeah.

You just don't get it, Stan!

Why can't I be like all the other kids?
They all have three-bedroom homes, broken trucks on their lawns.
And cut-up hot dogs for lunch
It's not my fault my parents succeed so much.
There's no one in town I can relate to.
I play with autographed baseball bats
while everyone else just plays with sticks and pine cones
Has a boy ever felt so alone?
Well, who needs them anyway? I won't pretend to be something I'm not
If I can't be poor, I've got to deal with what I've got.
If I can't be like them, what I need is more rich kids around,
So I'm not the only one, and then I won't be so... down.
Please, God, send more rich kids...
To my...
Town

You're a guest here! Your mom isn't in charge!

What?! We don't have a bass guitar.

Oh! 

He's chubby,  he's filthy , and he's just a little bit nuts.  Here he is, America's newest sweetheart, Fatty Doo Doo! 

I'm good.

Hey! In here! 

Yeah, I was watching with my whole family. And then we saw all the replays this morning in the news.

Thanks, dude.

I'm sorry Kyle. I like girls. 

Aaaah. Oh, I know. 

Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'll see you around. 

Well, yeah, but can't we just play without these uncomfortable uniforms? 

I'm gonna start saying that now.

YAY! 

Well, I'm Token

This is my room! I'll take the remote from you!

Yeah.

I also printed out the results on my color printer. Here you are, Ms. Choksondik. 

All the kids at school made fun of me today because I'm rich.

I don't wanna be rich anymore! I wanna eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and, and wear clothes from J mart!

Why?

That's the alarm; someone's in the back yard.

Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, babyBut I'm the one who loves youAnd there's no one else! No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh one else.

Thanks.

No.

What the hell?! 

Aah, he's a lawyer. I think.

Yeah. Now that it's over, I.. I guess it was kind of fun. 

Yes. Um. Great Aslan. I don't fit in anywhere else.

Six!

Nothing!

If somebody kills somebody, it's a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it's a hate crime.

You- you talked. I, I understood you. I must be becoming a lion!

This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!

It doesn't matter, Mom. They're poor people pants.

Yeah.

Oh my God! Okay!

So what?!

Yeah, that turkey sucks.

Yeah. It was great.

"Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy." 

Are... you... Aslan?

I can't help it!

When was the last guy you had a manicure, straight man? 

Butters!

So can I stay?

Alright, that's enough!  You think I should feel bad for you because of the Trayvon Martin verdict?!

And I am Black Chaku,  with the power of perfect spelling!

Yeah, well, you know, I did a little shopping at J mart.

That doesn't mean I can just be fine.

... I don't want the code name Blackie.

Are you serious?

Can I go back to class now?

I uhhh, have band practice.

Hi.

Well, I don't know.

Who do they say is the ugliest?

You made everyone think I'm a fucking Patient Zero!

...Yeah?

Jesus, lions suck!

Thanks, everyone. Please tell me that you'll never do that again, Jimmy.

I'm not playing anymore. 

Wow, she's hot.

Sooo black people are midgets. 

Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. We've got water, and, and maybe somebody even left some food laying around. Come on. 

I don't know, I don't wanna know. I'm out. 

I only have this.

Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air.

That's good, Fatty, get pissed!

There has to be another way!

Okay good, yeah.

Hey you guys. 

An apology?! He shot me!

Nothin'

Yeah. We need a leader like Bebe. She can teach us all so much.

This game is too confusing. How about we have a snowball fight?

Well it's a pretty fucking stupid law!

At least then we'd be voicing our concern. I mean, if you think about it, we should feel some shame for... complaining about it and not doing anything.

Yeah.

Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television.

Action News!

You're gonna get it now, Hammerclaw!

Okay, really?

I know. But why?

No, but you can't just pretend it never happened either!

You're right, guys. From now on, I'm fine with being made fun of for being rich.

What?

Uh-oh, looks like it's Panda Bear Madness Minute! 

Ow. 

Yeah.

Hi.

I don't care, either. 

No, because there's a spring in there, and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna hurt my finger.
