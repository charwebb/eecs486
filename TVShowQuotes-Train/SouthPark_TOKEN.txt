This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!
Oh I see, so I'm supposed to feel all better now.
That's the alarm; someone's in the back yard.
This isn't a poem. It doesn't even rhyme.
It doesn't matter, Mom. They're poor people pants.
...And this is the room where my mom and dad keep their original v-Van Gogh painting.
If you know of a way, wizard, then speak.
Oh... Hey guys.  What, what are you doin' here?
I admit nothing! Maybe Irene lied to you!
You're right, guys. From now on, I'm fine with being made fun of for being rich.
Mom? Dad? Why do we have a bigger house than everybody else in South Park? 
Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television.
That doesn't mean I can just be fine.
Yeah, I know. But you guys always rip on me for bein' rich.
Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. We've got water, and, and maybe somebody even left some food laying around. Come on. 
Yeah. Now that it's over, I.. I guess it was kind of fun. 
This is my room! I'll take the remote from you!
I also printed out the results on my color printer. Here you are, Ms. Choksondik. 
Jimmy and Eric, it looks like a massive snow storm is headed South Park's way. I asked my dad last night and he said that he heard the snow storm is expected on Tuesday. Guys?
That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster!
Wait! I liked being ripped on for being rich better! 
Will you stop changing channels and just pick something?
I'm just so happy you guys moved into town. You see, I used to be the only rich kid. All the other families here are kinda  low to  middle-income.
How do you know? None of us had ever had any drugs before.
I'm sorry too. I wouldn't even talk to you at first because you were black. 
Yes. Um. Great Aslan. I don't fit in anywhere else.
It may be a mistake, but you don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. So don't say it isn't a big deal.
"If I could be Bebe."  "If I was Bebe I would have lots of friends because I would be sooo great. I would make people smile and think wherever I went."
You- you talked. I, I understood you. I must be becoming a lion!
Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness.
You'll never find...As long as you live...Someone who loves you...Tender like I do...
And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing.
But you spent all the money we made!
Well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't-
Thanks, everyone. Please tell me that you'll never do that again, Jimmy.
Jesse Jackson, is not the emperor, of black people! 
Using my laptop computer, I hooked into the Internet and found a meteorology Web site.  I donwloaded the data, and with my dad's video projector, I can show you the graph I made of predictable weather patterns over the next three months. 
Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'll see you around. 
Wow, my plan to get rich people here sure did work. Hey, I got a great idea! Let's all pack some lunches and go sledding.
Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.  I'm trying to work my way back home.
Why can't I be like all the other kids?
They all have three-bedroom homes, broken trucks on their lawns.
And cut-up hot dogs for lunch
It's not my fault my parents succeed so much.
There's no one in town I can relate to.
I play with autographed baseball bats
while everyone else just plays with sticks and pine cones
Has a boy ever felt so alone?
Well, who needs them anyway? I won't pretend to be something I'm not
If I can't be poor, I've got to deal with what I've got.
If I can't be like them, what I need is more rich kids around,
So I'm not the only one, and then I won't be so... down.
Please, God, send more rich kids...
To my...
Town
No tornadoes, Eric, but interestingly enough, there is a low-pressure storm moving in over the Park County Valley. Should bring us some chilly days ahead. 
At least then we'd be voicing our concern. I mean, if you think about it, we should feel some shame for... complaining about it and not doing anything.
Yeah! We should make up a bunch of reports about how dangerous it is to be alive.
Well, I guess that makes sense. All right. 
... I don't want the code name Blackie.
Oh, come on, guys. You have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me.
Good job, dickhead! You lost the entire audience!
Uh, well, actually it is kind of a big deal, Stan.
The cough companies claim they don't intend for their product to be used by kids to get high! But one look at the packaging tells otherwise.  Theradryl DM. For kids.  Dexa Cough, children's formula.
No, but you can't just pretend it never happened either!
And why does standing your ground not apply to fucking white people?!
Pluto is also the furthest planet from the sun, though scientists believe more planets lie beyond it. I hope you enjoyed my report on the Solar System. Thank you. 
Hello, my name is Token. I don't fit in with all the kids at South Park Elementary so, I invited a bunch of rich kids to move to town. The problem is, I don't fit in with them, either. That's why I've come to live with you.  So if you'll have me and raise me as one of your own, I promise to be the best lion I could be.  Uuuh, yeah.
Come on! Hurry up!  Hey, what are you guys doin'?
No, because there's a spring in there, and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna hurt my finger.
They do. But, I guess I learned something today. You see, even though kids at South Park make fun of me, I still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or, lions. Even though I may be different from them, I still like my old friends best.
Well, yeah, but can't we just play without these uncomfortable uniforms? 
I don't wanna be rich anymore! I wanna eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and, and wear clothes from J mart!
He doesn't need to know the truth. Kyle will get what he wants, and so will I. 
Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air.
Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are sure to win!
...And when the woman has four penises in her at the same time, then stands over the men and pees on them, is that part of being in love too?  Five midgets, spanking a man... covered in Thousand Island dressing. Is that making love?
We were at why I should give you ten percent.
Uh-oh, looks like it's Panda Bear Madness Minute! 
All the kids at school made fun of me today because I'm rich.
Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?
This game is too confusing. How about we have a snowball fight?
Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, babyBut I'm the one who loves youAnd there's no one else! No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh one else.
I just wanna be like all the other kids in South Park. Please, Mom and Dad, please. 
He's chubby,  he's filthy , and he's just a little bit nuts.  Here he is, America's newest sweetheart, Fatty Doo Doo! 
You're a guest here! Your mom isn't in charge!
And I am Black Chaku,  with the power of perfect spelling!
Yeah, you said you had a startup company and that school was for douchebags.
I was just thinking the same thing. It's like, she's a girl, but, she's someone you could hang out with.
You made everyone think I'm a fucking Patient Zero!
... (you're gonna miss my lovin')I know you're gonna my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my lo-o-ove.
That's not a blinding device, Dad. It's fluorescent lighting.
If you really think it's not a big deal, then you really are ignorant. That's all. I'm not "fighting" anybody. 
Why the hell would I be looking way over there??
I don't know, I don't wanna know. I'm out. 
Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television.
Yeah. We need a leader like Bebe. She can teach us all so much.
I am not scared. I'll go inside and watch the tape,  just for a few seconds. If I do not return in two minutes, send a party in after me.  The fate of Middle-earth... is in my hands. 
Yeah, I was watching with my whole family. And then we saw all the replays this morning in the news.
Hey, there was a bass guitar in my basement.
What the hell is wrong with you?! Why are you all here listening to this?!
Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years of darkness or not?
Yeah, but don't worry. It didn't do so good. We got killed in the ratings by Honey Boo Boo.
