Good job, dickhead! You lost the entire audience!

But she's not black, Kyle. She's white.  The bar is determined by society, Kyle. And it's not something that can just be raised up.  Not by us, or anyone else.

Oh, come on, guys. You have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me.

And I am Black Chaku,  with the power of perfect spelling!

That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster!

I have every reason to be mad! You just don't get it!

There are still people who will look at us funny. That think we're supposed to be together.

When was the last guy you had a manicure, straight man? 

Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air.

Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.  I'm trying to work my way back home.

Wow, my plan to get rich people here sure did work. Hey, I got a great idea! Let's all pack some lunches and go sledding.

This game is too confusing. How about we have a snowball fight?

No, because there's a spring in there, and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna hurt my finger.

Jesse Jackson, is not the emperor, of black people! 

This is my room! I'll take the remote from you!

You're right, guys. From now on, I'm fine with being made fun of for being rich.

How do you know? None of us had ever had any drugs before.

I also printed out the results on my color printer. Here you are, Ms. Choksondik. 

What the hell is wrong with you?! Why are you all here listening to this?!

And why does standing your ground not apply to fucking white people?!

All the kids at school made fun of me today because I'm rich.

Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?

... (you're gonna miss my lovin')I know you're gonna my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my lo-o-ove.

This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!

Will you stop changing channels and just pick something?

He's chubby,  he's filthy , and he's just a little bit nuts.  Here he is, America's newest sweetheart, Fatty Doo Doo! 

Come on! Hurry up!  Hey, what are you guys doin'?

I'm just so happy you guys moved into town. You see, I used to be the only rich kid. All the other families here are kinda  low to  middle-income.

Yeah, I know. But you guys always rip on me for bein' rich.

Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are sure to win!

Uh-oh, looks like it's Panda Bear Madness Minute! 

No tornadoes, Eric, but interestingly enough, there is a low-pressure storm moving in over the Park County Valley. Should bring us some chilly days ahead. 

Hey, there was a bass guitar in my basement.

Oh I see, so I'm supposed to feel all better now.

Pluto is also the furthest planet from the sun, though scientists believe more planets lie beyond it. I hope you enjoyed my report on the Solar System. Thank you. 

If you know of a way, wizard, then speak.

Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, babyBut I'm the one who loves youAnd there's no one else! No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh one else.

Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. We've got water, and, and maybe somebody even left some food laying around. Come on. 

Yeah, well, you know, I did a little shopping at J mart.

I can remember... exactly where I was... the first time I saw Honey Boo Boo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A shameful, fat family eating white trash food to their death. And then I saw what network it was on: The Learning Channel.  If they can feel okay about that, why can't I?

I don't wanna be rich anymore! I wanna eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and, and wear clothes from J mart!

That's the alarm; someone's in the back yard.

Oh... Hey guys.  What, what are you doin' here?

Well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't-

Yes. Um. Great Aslan. I don't fit in anywhere else.

You're a guest here! Your mom isn't in charge!

...And this is the room where my mom and dad keep their original v-Van Gogh painting.

It may be a mistake, but you don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. So don't say it isn't a big deal.

Come on!  Hey look: there pants are only five bucks apiece. They must really suck. What do ya think?

Why can't I be like all the other kids?
They all have three-bedroom homes, broken trucks on their lawns.
And cut-up hot dogs for lunch
It's not my fault my parents succeed so much.
There's no one in town I can relate to.
I play with autographed baseball bats
while everyone else just plays with sticks and pine cones
Has a boy ever felt so alone?
Well, who needs them anyway? I won't pretend to be something I'm not
If I can't be poor, I've got to deal with what I've got.
If I can't be like them, what I need is more rich kids around,
So I'm not the only one, and then I won't be so... down.
Please, God, send more rich kids...
To my...
Town

Yeah! We should make up a bunch of reports about how dangerous it is to be alive.

Alright, that's enough!  You think I should feel bad for you because of the Trayvon Martin verdict?!

They do. But, I guess I learned something today. You see, even though kids at South Park make fun of me, I still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or, lions. Even though I may be different from them, I still like my old friends best.

Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness.

That doesn't mean I can just be fine.

You made everyone think I'm a fucking Patient Zero!

Uh, well, actually it is kind of a big deal, Stan.

Yeah. Now that it's over, I.. I guess it was kind of fun. 

"If I could be Bebe."  "If I was Bebe I would have lots of friends because I would be sooo great. I would make people smile and think wherever I went."

Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television.

I don't know, I don't wanna know. I'm out. 

That's not a blinding device, Dad. It's fluorescent lighting.

Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'll see you around. 

But you spent all the money we made!

And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing.

...And when the woman has four penises in her at the same time, then stands over the men and pees on them, is that part of being in love too?  Five midgets, spanking a man... covered in Thousand Island dressing. Is that making love?

You'll never find...As long as you live...Someone who loves you...Tender like I do...

Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years of darkness or not?

Wait! I liked being ripped on for being rich better! 

This isn't a poem. It doesn't even rhyme.

Yeah, you said you had a startup company and that school was for douchebags.

Well, I guess that makes sense. All right. 

Hello, my name is Token. I don't fit in with all the kids at South Park Elementary so, I invited a bunch of rich kids to move to town. The problem is, I don't fit in with them, either. That's why I've come to live with you.  So if you'll have me and raise me as one of your own, I promise to be the best lion I could be.  Uuuh, yeah.

No, but you can't just pretend it never happened either!

I admit nothing! Maybe Irene lied to you!

Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television.

Well, yeah, but can't we just play without these uncomfortable uniforms? 

If you really think it's not a big deal, then you really are ignorant. That's all. I'm not "fighting" anybody. 

Thanks, everyone. Please tell me that you'll never do that again, Jimmy.

Mom? Dad? Why do we have a bigger house than everybody else in South Park? 

At least then we'd be voicing our concern. I mean, if you think about it, we should feel some shame for... complaining about it and not doing anything.

Yeah. We need a leader like Bebe. She can teach us all so much.

The cough companies claim they don't intend for their product to be used by kids to get high! But one look at the packaging tells otherwise.  Theradryl DM. For kids.  Dexa Cough, children's formula.

Yeah, but don't worry. It didn't do so good. We got killed in the ratings by Honey Boo Boo.

I just wanna be like all the other kids in South Park. Please, Mom and Dad, please. 

You- you talked. I, I understood you. I must be becoming a lion!

Why the hell would I be looking way over there??

I am not scared. I'll go inside and watch the tape,  just for a few seconds. If I do not return in two minutes, send a party in after me.  The fate of Middle-earth... is in my hands. 

I was just thinking the same thing. It's like, she's a girl, but, she's someone you could hang out with.
