All the time. A mechanic forms an emotional attachment, thinks he'sgonna lose the car, he panics, he does something rash. I'm gonna ask you somepersonal questions. I'm sorry if I touch a nerve, but I think it'll help with the case. Had you been taking good care of the car?
Get your coat, we gotta take you in.
What was the suspect wearing at the time of the incident?
(making a note) Alright Mr Seinfeld, we'll let you know if we find anything. I gotta be honest with you, these cases never end up well.

Well, did you leave the A/C on? Do you zip over speed bumps? Do you ride the clutch? Things like that.
We really can't tell. You better bring your service records.
