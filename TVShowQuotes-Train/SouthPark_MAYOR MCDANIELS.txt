But now, before we light the tree, I think we should all reflect for a moment on those who are less fortunate than us.  Right now in Iraq there are children who fear us and what we might do to their country. The threat of war touches us all, but over in Iraq, there is no Christmas. They have nothing.
And the winner is: Squash-O-Lantern, by Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and the evil Eric Cartman from the parallel universe! "The Winning Entry! Squash in cobweb, amid a tiny graveyard and flanked by four tiny bats"
Okay, people. What are we rabbling about now?
All right, people. Scientist Marsh and I have been working very hard on the problem of spontaneous combustion, and we have finally come up with a solution. Mr. Marsh?
...And so, we want you to design and build a great wall, all around the city.
People! People, quiet, please!  We must not panic!
I believe that Professor Thomas from the University has come up with a solution.
Yes, Marsh. We have a new problem, and I think only you can solve it.
That's it? That's it! The song's over! We can light the tree! 
Go on, Jimmy! There's only five more seconds until Christmas! 
The bar has been sold to Persian club owners. I don't know what you want me to do about it.
You have got me in a lot of trouble! 
Kid, what the hell are you talking about?
I signed a permit allowing them to have their concert here. Their little "festival" should pump some money into our economy.
Look, you're the only scientist that lives in this town. You have to find an answer before more people combust. You do that, and you'll be the most beloved man in South Park. 
My God, it's burning up in here! Can't we crank the AC up some more?
That's it. We're going to Plan B. Nuke the crowd!
Well, we'd love a Christmas song, wouldn't we, folks?
People, what do you think we need to do?
Good evening, everyone. In a moment we'll be lighting the South Park Christmas Tree to kick off the holidays!
Oh, that's nice! You made our entire town look like gay-bashing redneck homophobes, but at least you're sorry!
And that's really all I can tell you. The town of South Park is going to be leveled, in order to make way for a twelve-lane superhighway.
They don't have to know. I can sign whatever permit I want!
As we celebrate this glorious time, we can't forget those families who are suffering. As many of you know, the Broflovski family has recently had their child torn away from them. As a community, we must do all we can to ease their pain. Are there any suggestions how we might help?
Marsh, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Find the cause of spontaneous combustion, or else!
Then it's settled: This year we'll give all our Christmas money to the Broflovskis, in hopes that they may someday have their child returned to them. 
...Why would you write something like that and be proud of it?!
Quiet people! The town square is public space. That means if neither group will nicely and maturely move the day of its rally, I'll just have to give the town square to both groups.
Alright, people, let's start rebuilding our town! For the 39th time.
The Native Americans have purchased the land from under us. Tomorrow, they're buying the last of what they need to have complete ownership.
These boys symbolize how we all feel about loss. Who are we to tell them it's impossible?
What?! You four boys, in my office, NOW!
All right, people, we can move onto issue number 14B.
People, I told you, you have to share the stage.
As it was in the times of our forefathers, so it is now. Stan Marsh, for not following our most sacred of rites, you are hereby banished from South Park for all eternity. Or until you decide that voting is important. Good-bye, Stan. May the gods treat you more kindly than we did. 
The people are panicking about spontaneous combustion. That's why I've assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon. You are the best scientific mind South Park has to offer.
Students, I am here because of a very serious matter. This morning it was discovered that in several places all over town, somebody had spray-painted the words, "Fags get out." Many witnesses reported seeing children with spray paint. Now, if anybody knows anything about the kids who did this, you must come forward-
Now, look, it isn't all horrible. The Native Americans are offering you retail values on your homes.
We're gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand! Let's move, people!
People of South Park, it is my honor to introduce a woman who deserves nothing but respect. Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton! 
No, no. In fact, they never came to South Park. We've never heard of them.
You four turd balls in my office NOW!
And so we salute Randy Marsh and his unified theory of moderation that has saved us all. 
Okay. If you're right about this, Marsh, you're going to be the most popular man in South Park.
And so without further ado, here's the most courageous, most amazing man on the planet, Christopher Reeve. 
Now get out to the carnival and enjoy the amazing rides and the wonderful games!
Oh my God! Officer Barbrady, ugh, you never had Tom and Mary in this cell.
I'm sorry, but my hands are tied. The new owners plan to start redecorating the bar tomorrow. You have to be out by then.
She's gaining support all over the country. I should have never listened to you!
You mean, Jared's aides are like my aides?
Well, let's go talk to them. Stick by me. 
Mr. Garrison, every Christmas you suggest we get rid of all the Mexicans, and every Christmas we tell you "NO!"
And we will all miss you, Chef,  but we know you must do what your heart tells you..
So, from this day forward, everyone in South Park will be required to fart on a regular basis to insure that nobody else spontaneously explodes.
Ahalright, here to light the Christmas Tree is a very special young man who shows us all the true meaning of Christmas. Jimmy. 
Alright, Jared, you sick pervert! Do you have anything to say before you die?!
All right, people, we need to come up with answers. There are homeless sprouting up all over town. What are we supposed to do? 
This certainly has been an enlightening evening. And as Mayor, I accept your petition and will abolish all separation laws.
Yes. The temperature is steadily rising every day. I want you to find out why.
All right, people, let's save it!  They still have a long way to go!
Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to kick off the 14th Annual South Park Cow Days!  As most of you know, Cow Days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble, gentle cows.  And now, the chairman of Cow Days, Jimbo Kern!
