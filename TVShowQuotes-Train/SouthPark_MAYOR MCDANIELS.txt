And that's really all I can tell you. The town of South Park is going to be leveled, in order to make way for a twelve-lane superhighway.
That's it. We're going to Plan B. Nuke the crowd!
Oh, that's nice! You made our entire town look like gay-bashing redneck homophobes, but at least you're sorry!
These boys symbolize how we all feel about loss. Who are we to tell them it's impossible?
Mr. Garrison, every Christmas you suggest we get rid of all the Mexicans, and every Christmas we tell you "NO!"
As it was in the times of our forefathers, so it is now. Stan Marsh, for not following our most sacred of rites, you are hereby banished from South Park for all eternity. Or until you decide that voting is important. Good-bye, Stan. May the gods treat you more kindly than we did. 
I believe that Professor Thomas from the University has come up with a solution.
Well, perhaps, one day, cows will learn that cults are never a good thing.
Well, let's go talk to them. Stick by me. 
We're gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand! Let's move, people!
All right, people. Scientist Marsh and I have been working very hard on the problem of spontaneous combustion, and we have finally come up with a solution. Mr. Marsh?
You have got me in a lot of trouble! 
And so we salute Randy Marsh and his unified theory of moderation that has saved us all. 
All right, people, let's save it!  They still have a long way to go!
Kid, what the hell are you talking about?
The Native Americans have purchased the land from under us. Tomorrow, they're buying the last of what they need to have complete ownership.
...Why would you write something like that and be proud of it?!
All right, people, we are all extremely upset over what's happened.  But let's try to speak one at a time.
Oh my God! Officer Barbrady, ugh, you never had Tom and Mary in this cell.
I signed a permit allowing them to have their concert here. Their little "festival" should pump some money into our economy.
Yes, but standing out here yelling "Rabble rabble rabble" isn't going to help anything.
Students, I am here because of a very serious matter. This morning it was discovered that in several places all over town, somebody had spray-painted the words, "Fags get out." Many witnesses reported seeing children with spray paint. Now, if anybody knows anything about the kids who did this, you must come forward-
And the cows? Are they all back, too?
Then it's settled: This year we'll give all our Christmas money to the Broflovskis, in hopes that they may someday have their child returned to them. 
Marsh, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Find the cause of spontaneous combustion, or else!
Quiet people! The town square is public space. That means if neither group will nicely and maturely move the day of its rally, I'll just have to give the town square to both groups.
People of South Park, it is my honor to introduce a woman who deserves nothing but respect. Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton! 
Alright, Jared, you sick pervert! Do you have anything to say before you die?!
She's gaining support all over the country. I should have never listened to you!
People, I told you, you have to share the stage.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to kick off the 14th Annual South Park Cow Days!  As most of you know, Cow Days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble, gentle cows.  And now, the chairman of Cow Days, Jimbo Kern!
Alright, people, let's start rebuilding our town! For the 39th time.
Good evening, everyone. In a moment we'll be lighting the South Park Christmas Tree to kick off the holidays!
And the winner is: Squash-O-Lantern, by Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and the evil Eric Cartman from the parallel universe! "The Winning Entry! Squash in cobweb, amid a tiny graveyard and flanked by four tiny bats"
And so without further ado, here's the most courageous, most amazing man on the planet, Christopher Reeve. 
Now get out to the carnival and enjoy the amazing rides and the wonderful games!
You four turd balls in my office NOW!
So, from this day forward, everyone in South Park will be required to fart on a regular basis to insure that nobody else spontaneously explodes.
What?! You four boys, in my office, NOW!
You mean, Jared's aides are like my aides?
But now, before we light the tree, I think we should all reflect for a moment on those who are less fortunate than us.  Right now in Iraq there are children who fear us and what we might do to their country. The threat of war touches us all, but over in Iraq, there is no Christmas. They have nothing.
And we will all miss you, Chef,  but we know you must do what your heart tells you..
I'm sorry, but my hands are tied. The new owners plan to start redecorating the bar tomorrow. You have to be out by then.
Okay, people. What are we rabbling about now?
Yes. The temperature is steadily rising every day. I want you to find out why.
All right, people, we need to come up with answers. There are homeless sprouting up all over town. What are we supposed to do? 
The people are panicking about spontaneous combustion. That's why I've assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon. You are the best scientific mind South Park has to offer.
Well, we'd love a Christmas song, wouldn't we, folks?
Yes, Marsh. We have a new problem, and I think only you can solve it.
They don't have to know. I can sign whatever permit I want!
As we celebrate this glorious time, we can't forget those families who are suffering. As many of you know, the Broflovski family has recently had their child torn away from them. As a community, we must do all we can to ease their pain. Are there any suggestions how we might help?
...And so, we want you to design and build a great wall, all around the city.
And I want to assure the nation that is watching that South Park is not a town of prejudice or bigotry.
Now, look, it isn't all horrible. The Native Americans are offering you retail values on your homes.
That's it? That's it! The song's over! We can light the tree! 
Go on, Jimmy! There's only five more seconds until Christmas! 
People! People, quiet, please!  We must not panic!
The bar has been sold to Persian club owners. I don't know what you want me to do about it.
Ahalright, here to light the Christmas Tree is a very special young man who shows us all the true meaning of Christmas. Jimmy. 
People, what do you think we need to do?
This certainly has been an enlightening evening. And as Mayor, I accept your petition and will abolish all separation laws.
