All right, people, we are all extremely upset over what's happened.  But let's try to speak one at a time.
And so without further ado, here's the most courageous, most amazing man on the planet, Christopher Reeve. 
Yes, Marsh. We have a new problem, and I think only you can solve it.
All right, people, let's save it!  They still have a long way to go!
Go on, Jimmy! There's only five more seconds until Christmas! 
And I want to assure the nation that is watching that South Park is not a town of prejudice or bigotry.
Yes, but standing out here yelling "Rabble rabble rabble" isn't going to help anything.
We're gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand! Let's move, people!
I signed a permit allowing them to have their concert here. Their little "festival" should pump some money into our economy.
As it was in the times of our forefathers, so it is now. Stan Marsh, for not following our most sacred of rites, you are hereby banished from South Park for all eternity. Or until you decide that voting is important. Good-bye, Stan. May the gods treat you more kindly than we did. 
This certainly has been an enlightening evening. And as Mayor, I accept your petition and will abolish all separation laws.
Okay. If you're right about this, Marsh, you're going to be the most popular man in South Park.
These boys symbolize how we all feel about loss. Who are we to tell them it's impossible?
As we celebrate this glorious time, we can't forget those families who are suffering. As many of you know, the Broflovski family has recently had their child torn away from them. As a community, we must do all we can to ease their pain. Are there any suggestions how we might help?
And so I declare today Randy Marsh Day, where we shall remember forever how he freed us all from the threat of spontaneous combustion. Gentlemen? 
No, no. In fact, they never came to South Park. We've never heard of them.
All right, people, we need to come up with answers. There are homeless sprouting up all over town. What are we supposed to do? 
Oh, that's nice! You made our entire town look like gay-bashing redneck homophobes, but at least you're sorry!
Oh my God! Officer Barbrady, ugh, you never had Tom and Mary in this cell.
People! People, quiet, please!  We must not panic!
Students, I am here because of a very serious matter. This morning it was discovered that in several places all over town, somebody had spray-painted the words, "Fags get out." Many witnesses reported seeing children with spray paint. Now, if anybody knows anything about the kids who did this, you must come forward-
People, what do you think we need to do?
The people are panicking about spontaneous combustion. That's why I've assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon. You are the best scientific mind South Park has to offer.
All right, people. Scientist Marsh and I have been working very hard on the problem of spontaneous combustion, and we have finally come up with a solution. Mr. Marsh?
You four turd balls in my office NOW!
That's it. We're going to Plan B. Nuke the crowd!
Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to kick off the 14th Annual South Park Cow Days!  As most of you know, Cow Days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble, gentle cows.  And now, the chairman of Cow Days, Jimbo Kern!
They don't have to know. I can sign whatever permit I want!
I believe that Professor Thomas from the University has come up with a solution.
Well, perhaps, one day, cows will learn that cults are never a good thing.
Kid, what the hell are you talking about?
But now, before we light the tree, I think we should all reflect for a moment on those who are less fortunate than us.  Right now in Iraq there are children who fear us and what we might do to their country. The threat of war touches us all, but over in Iraq, there is no Christmas. They have nothing.
...Why would you write something like that and be proud of it?!
People of South Park, it is my honor to introduce a woman who deserves nothing but respect. Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton! 
Well, let's go talk to them. Stick by me. 
And that's really all I can tell you. The town of South Park is going to be leveled, in order to make way for a twelve-lane superhighway.
Well, we'd love a Christmas song, wouldn't we, folks?
My God, it's burning up in here! Can't we crank the AC up some more?
Now, look, it isn't all horrible. The Native Americans are offering you retail values on your homes.
She's gaining support all over the country. I should have never listened to you!
Ahalright, here to light the Christmas Tree is a very special young man who shows us all the true meaning of Christmas. Jimmy. 
That's it? That's it! The song's over! We can light the tree! 
And we will all miss you, Chef,  but we know you must do what your heart tells you..
And the cows? Are they all back, too?
Mr. Garrison, every Christmas you suggest we get rid of all the Mexicans, and every Christmas we tell you "NO!"
You mean, Jared's aides are like my aides?
All right, people, we can move onto issue number 14B.
Good evening, everyone. In a moment we'll be lighting the South Park Christmas Tree to kick off the holidays!
Marsh, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Find the cause of spontaneous combustion, or else!
Then it's settled: This year we'll give all our Christmas money to the Broflovskis, in hopes that they may someday have their child returned to them. 
Now get out to the carnival and enjoy the amazing rides and the wonderful games!
I'm sorry, but my hands are tied. The new owners plan to start redecorating the bar tomorrow. You have to be out by then.
...And so, we want you to design and build a great wall, all around the city.
People, I told you, you have to share the stage.
Alright, people, let's start rebuilding our town! For the 39th time.
And so we salute Randy Marsh and his unified theory of moderation that has saved us all. 
Yes. The temperature is steadily rising every day. I want you to find out why.
The Native Americans have purchased the land from under us. Tomorrow, they're buying the last of what they need to have complete ownership.
You have got me in a lot of trouble! 
Alright, Jared, you sick pervert! Do you have anything to say before you die?!
What?! You four boys, in my office, NOW!
