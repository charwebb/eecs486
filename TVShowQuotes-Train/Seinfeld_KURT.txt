Plus, you want to get to know me.
They thought I was George. I'm not that bald. And I have too little time left to take that kind of crap, so I, slugged him.
Elaine said you would be the best person I could talk to.
Elaine...(holds out a wedding ring) Will you marry me?
Well, my lawyer says 14 months, but with good behavior, maybe...10?
Ah, I gotta call the office. Honey, will you order for me?
Oh my God! (Steps into the doorway) I'm going bald!
Well, it still is. I shave my head for my swim team. I just liked the way it looked, so I kept it.
Hi, is George back from the cockfight yet? You know, I gotta thank him, he changed my life.
Uh, no - I only eat cage-free, farm-fresh.
What do you mean? (Goes into the bedroom to look in the mirror.)
