It's nothing.
(Seeing Elaine) Oh!
I happen to know for a fact, that he was called Maestro in social situations. I once saw him at a bar and someone came up to him and said "Hello Maestro, how about a beer". O.K. So that's a fact.
(Recognizing the currently playing song) Ohh, I love this piece. (Turns it up, then pantomimes that he is conducting the instruments)
I just wanted to drop off this Chinese balm for your burns. It's supposed to be great stuff. It's all herbal.
Elaine? What a surprise.
Well I have to be going.
Ciao.
Good question. (to waiter) We'll need a few minutes.
(Making his exit, he lays the charm on Mrs. Costanza) Madame, you have been an extremely gracious hostess. (Kisses her hand)
Well if you're thinking of getting a place there don't bother. There's really nothing available.
It is my very great pleasure. (Kisses Elaine's hand)
Ohh.. (Looking at the box) Ori-dent - that electric toothbrush I've heard so much about..
Oh. Love it when that happeneds.
(Agreeing to a game) Ah, then I shall be there. And now, Gentlemen, (Making dramatic actions) if you will excuse me - I must prepare for the symphony.
Fine.
Oh, Elaine.. wait for me after the concert? We'll celebrate.
You know, I'm sorry but, I didn't mention it earlier but actually I preferred to be called Maestro.
Beethoven's 7th.
I told you, it's paradise.
Nor should you.
You keep a perfect crease by not sitting in them before the performance.
The houses are passed down from generation to generation, it's very hard.
Unfortunately those photographs are at home.
Oh I suppose it's O.K. for Leonard Burnstein to be called Maestro because he conducted the New York Philharmonic. So he gets to be called Maestro and I don't.
You didn't find one, did you?
Got lucky. Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride, I was about to pop in some Verdi.
I've seen that man in Tuscany. Eccentric fellow. Reputation of being kind of a village idiot.
Ohh, what a sweet gesture. And autographed poster of my favorite tenor, with.. those two other guys. Oh, Elaine, this is magnifico!
Oh yeah?
Ah, Kramer.
And I fell in love with this house.
Well Hello. And who might you be?
Oh yeah, I've been at my house in Tuscany.
Coincidental.
And then about four years ago I was on holiday in Tuscany.
