(Sighs slightly) I, uh, think I'll get some air. (Slowly leaves)
Ohh, what a sweet gesture. And autographed poster of my favorite tenor, with.. those two other guys. Oh, Elaine, this is magnifico!
Well, ya know I am a conductor.
Good question. (to waiter) We'll need a few minutes.
Ohh.. (Looking at the box) Ori-dent - that electric toothbrush I've heard so much about..
(Recognizing the currently playing song) Ohh, I love this piece. (Turns it up, then pantomimes that he is conducting the instruments)
You didn't find one, did you?
Elaine? What a surprise.
Oh, Elaine.. wait for me after the concert? We'll celebrate.
Nor should you.
Ciao.
It is my very great pleasure. (Kisses Elaine's hand)
The houses are passed down from generation to generation, it's very hard.
Oh. Love it when that happeneds.
It's nothing.
(Seeing Elaine) Oh!
Oh yeah?
Beethoven's 7th.
(Noticing the expressions) Ohh, my pants. (Begins putting on a near-by pair of pants) It's an old conductor's trick I learned from Leonard Bernstein.
Ah, Kramer.
I happen to know for a fact, that he was called Maestro in social situations. I once saw him at a bar and someone came up to him and said "Hello Maestro, how about a beer". O.K. So that's a fact.
(Agreeing to a game) Ah, then I shall be there. And now, Gentlemen, (Making dramatic actions) if you will excuse me - I must prepare for the symphony.
Fine.
Well if you're thinking of getting a place there don't bother. There's really nothing available.
I've seen that man in Tuscany. Eccentric fellow. Reputation of being kind of a village idiot.
Unfortunately those photographs are at home.
You keep a perfect crease by not sitting in them before the performance.
And then about four years ago I was on holiday in Tuscany.
Oh yeah, I've been at my house in Tuscany.
You know, I'm sorry but, I didn't mention it earlier but actually I preferred to be called Maestro.
It's booked solid!
And I fell in love with this house.
I told you, it's paradise.
Coincidental.
Got lucky. Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride, I was about to pop in some Verdi.
I just wanted to drop off this Chinese balm for your burns. It's supposed to be great stuff. It's all herbal.
