(Recognizing the currently playing song) Ohh, I love this piece. (Turns it up, then pantomimes that he is conducting the instruments)
Got lucky. Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride, I was about to pop in some Verdi.
You know, I'm sorry but, I didn't mention it earlier but actually I preferred to be called Maestro.
You keep a perfect crease by not sitting in them before the performance.
(Agreeing to a game) Ah, then I shall be there. And now, Gentlemen, (Making dramatic actions) if you will excuse me - I must prepare for the symphony.
Oh, Elaine.. wait for me after the concert? We'll celebrate.
Oh I suppose it's O.K. for Leonard Burnstein to be called Maestro because he conducted the New York Philharmonic. So he gets to be called Maestro and I don't.
Good question. (to waiter) We'll need a few minutes.
Ohh.. (Looking at the box) Ori-dent - that electric toothbrush I've heard so much about..
I've seen that man in Tuscany. Eccentric fellow. Reputation of being kind of a village idiot.
(Noticing the expressions) Ohh, my pants. (Begins putting on a near-by pair of pants) It's an old conductor's trick I learned from Leonard Bernstein.
And then about four years ago I was on holiday in Tuscany.
It is my very great pleasure. (Kisses Elaine's hand)
And I fell in love with this house.
I just wanted to drop off this Chinese balm for your burns. It's supposed to be great stuff. It's all herbal.
(Making his exit, he lays the charm on Mrs. Costanza) Madame, you have been an extremely gracious hostess. (Kisses her hand)
Ohh, what a sweet gesture. And autographed poster of my favorite tenor, with.. those two other guys. Oh, Elaine, this is magnifico!
Oh yeah, I've been at my house in Tuscany.
I happen to know for a fact, that he was called Maestro in social situations. I once saw him at a bar and someone came up to him and said "Hello Maestro, how about a beer". O.K. So that's a fact.
Well if you're thinking of getting a place there don't bother. There's really nothing available.
