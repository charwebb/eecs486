You know what? Uh, it's your last couple days, I'm gonna get out of your hair.
I will be in the break room.
[very uncomfortable] Look, what ever you're going to do, how long is it going to take? Ballpark. 'Cause I just, I gotta make a decision here. [gets out and slams the door]
Where were you on September 11th?
Hit me again. [Michael slaps him once more]
Mmhmm.
Maybe I just need to look into my heart. [in the bathroom in front of the mirror] DeAngelo, where is Michael Scott. [his reflection in the mirror turns around to reveal that it is Michael]
This is truly special, for me! And uh, anyway. It's so much lighter!
Dead man walking.
Awesome! Ani Ani Shelto! Here we come. Do you know how to high-five?
I know I'm the cause of this royal screw up but I would like to see this show go on.
[on his phone waiting for Andy, next to their car] Yes. Okay, alright. No, well thank you! Alright, take care. [hangs up] You'll never guess, we did it!
I can't. [Michael slaps him again]
This did not happen.
[walking out the client's room with Andy] That is cold sir! Absolutely cold. You know what? It was a complete waste of my time.
Let's rip it up homes. [smacks top of the door frame with his hand, leaving a chocolate hand outline]
[with Michael in his office] You're not gonna take all these toys are you?
Cause if you do now's the time.
[bad Australian accent attempt] THE DUNDIES!
Jim! Do you know where I can find Michael Scott?
Gimme that damn dog you f***ing thief! Don't ever do It again! [Andy nods modestly] You hear me?! [Andy nods again] You feel that energy?
Okay, fine I'll hold it.
[as Michael pulls over and stops the car] Please don't stop so suddenly, the seatbelt is pressing on my bladder. Why are you even wearing a seatbelt, you're sitting in the backseat, baby.
Well, you know, why don't we try it, and if it goes good it'll be part of my tradition.
[whispers to Michael] Michael, I'm very, very bad.
That is true, we do share some similarities. I know how you can fix one of those problems, for me it was portion control. For you, you need a key chain. Maybe one with a-
Thanks.
Is this an employee of ours?
Who am I doing this for?
That's stupid. [laughing. Nervously, Andy laughs with him]
THE DUNDIES ARE-OW-ABOUT COMING TOGETHER! AND RECOGNIZING, THE ADOMINABILITY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT! [Jim comes and closes the door]
Stop, hitting me.
Do you usually leave your door unlocked? And ajar?
Hold on, hold on one second. [puts on the headphones and turns the volume up all the way] I WANNA, I WANNA, I FEEL TRULY BLESSED! UHHH, TO BE WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU! BEFORE THIS ALL STARTED, FUNNY STORY, I WAS IN THE BATHROOM, VOMITTING, AND VOMITTING IN THE MEN'S ROOM!
This is so weird! If I'm conducting a meeting, good to go. But if I think of it as a performance... I-I fall apart. Obviously.
They say he's going to be my right hand man, adlib masturbation joke. [realizing he wasn't supposed to read that directly off the cue card, speaks quietly] No, I hate this, I hate it so much. [loud again] Dwight Schrute! Please accept this promising Assistant Manager Dundie. [people clap as Dwight takes the microphone, he is obviously unenthused] Thank you, thank you so much. I would like to thank something that we, uh, take for granted in our daily lives. And that is the humble trashcan. [Creed nods] This is for you trashcan! [walks off and throws the Dundie into the trashcan]
Meee Mo, Mee!
I can just run over to the gas station.
[recall to Dundies at Louie Volpies] Every day, millions of Americans suffer from extreme repulsiveness. Someone in our midst, is bringing that problem to light. Toby Flenderson, please come up here and accept the Extreme Repulsiveness Award. Oh that's so mean!
Oh good!
Gimme that dog! That's not your dog! [takes the dog from a confused Andy] Yeah! Again.
Not much of a performer, unless you count singing in the shower. Boy, okay...
[whispers] I'm not going in there.
[in car with Andy] okay, so what's our approach? You a veteran? Do I have a month to live? You gonna get married tomorrow? What? [Andy stares blankly] Hmm?
Thank you Michael, uh, but I will have to pass.
[with Dwight and Michael outside Michael's car] You know what, I have to go to the bathroom.
This was not, part of the job description!
[still laughing] What do you know? We gotta get psyched up! Okay? Guy? Let's get psyched! Is there an animal shelter on the way?
Congratulations!
[hands Andy a dog] I'm walking along, out of work. Again. Thinking to myself, 'I only have enough cash to by a sandwich, or get drunk. And I see this guy trying to steal this lady's dog! So I grab the dog. He runs off. She's so grateful, she hires me.
Uh, leave it at the door or...?
It reminds me of Katrina.
[hurriedly, while hiding the chocolate covered chicken] Hey!
Hello?
When I was very young, my mother divorced my father and I had to go to court and choose between them.
Neil Patrick Harris?
THE DUNDIES!
[falsetto] Measure your life in love!
Billy Crystal?
Ughhh, I gotta find Michael Scott! And then I gotta, [Russel Brand impression] Get Him to the Dundies!
No one is listening to me! And I'm running out of time!
[laying down, Michael is sitting on DeAngelo's stomach bouncing up and down in Michael's office] Me mo. Me mo.
Oh no!
[at the animal shelter with Andy] You know how I met Jo Bennett? And got started on my ladder of success?
[all are in the conference room for Michael's party. Michael isn't there. Jim gives the camera a knowing look] Well if he's not gonna make it at least we should go ahead and eat the cake. [Kevin nods] I for one love the corners. [cuts a corner piece, picks it up with his bare hands, and takes a bite] Why'd I just do that? It's not even that good. I don't even want it. I had cake for lunch. [throws the piece in the garbage] No, you know what? I've been good. I deserve this. [grabs a piece from another corner. The office groans] What am I doing? [chucks it into the trashcan] Come on DeAngelo! [DeAngelo tries to lick the cake, everybody yells no]
Not while I'm driving.
We did it!
[in the office near the accountants] Hey, can you help me find Michael Scott Angela?
I used to be obese. Once you've conquered obesity, everything else is easy. Life literally moves in slow motion. I'm not saying I'm superman, but, let me just put it this way. If I were shot in the head, I'm pretty sure everything would be fine. I almost welcome it. [winks]
THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR MOST OF THE EVENING...
Michael, are we?!
