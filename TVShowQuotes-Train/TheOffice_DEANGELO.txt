Not much of a performer, unless you count singing in the shower. Boy, okay...
Hit me again. [Michael slaps him once more]
Meee Mo, Mee!
[with Dwight and Michael outside Michael's car] You know what, I have to go to the bathroom.
Uhhh, you sir! [points to Jim] Are we having fun tonight?
Let's rip it up homes. [smacks top of the door frame with his hand, leaving a chocolate hand outline]
Uh, leave it at the door or...?
We did it!
[with Michael in his office] You're not gonna take all these toys are you?
Who am I doing this for?
Hold on, hold on one second. [puts on the headphones and turns the volume up all the way] I WANNA, I WANNA, I FEEL TRULY BLESSED! UHHH, TO BE WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU! BEFORE THIS ALL STARTED, FUNNY STORY, I WAS IN THE BATHROOM, VOMITTING, AND VOMITTING IN THE MEN'S ROOM!
[in car with Andy] okay, so what's our approach? You a veteran? Do I have a month to live? You gonna get married tomorrow? What? [Andy stares blankly] Hmm?
Neil Patrick Harris?
This did not happen.
Oh no!
That's nice. [reaches and a grabs a toy truck] How 'bout that truck? Can I have this little truck? I was thinking I might... glue a stapler on top. Or put a hole here, stick pens in it. [Michael gives an obviously fake smile] You okay?
[on his phone waiting for Andy, next to their car] Yes. Okay, alright. No, well thank you! Alright, take care. [hangs up] You'll never guess, we did it!
[giving his and Andy's pitch to a client] I would just like to start off saying, I have not worked with Mr. Andy Bernard for very long, I can say, is that he is no Michael Scott. I can't sit here and tell you he's gonna be a success. I can't sit here and tell you that he's even the best man for the job. [Andy looks awkward] But I can say this: He's got potential. Sure. You know, I always say: go big, or go home. You go with This guy, you could be making the biggest mistake of your life, OR, the biggest, Good decision of your life. It's either gonna be the best thing you ever did, or the worst thing you ever did. If you want some boring, white bread clock-watcher who's gonna get you your paper when you ordered it, for the agreed upon price, [Andy looks hopeful] Andy's not your guy. [Andy deflates] You ever play Russian Roulette? [scoffs] Time to spin the chamber horse. By signing up for another year. [hands the client a folder he needs signed for another year's contract]
[falsetto] Measure your life in love!
Michael, are we?!
Gimme that dog! That's not your dog! [takes the dog from a confused Andy] Yeah! Again.
That's stupid. [laughing. Nervously, Andy laughs with him]
Okay, fine I'll hold it.
I will be in the break room.
Well, you know, why don't we try it, and if it goes good it'll be part of my tradition.
[in the office near the accountants] Hey, can you help me find Michael Scott Angela?
Thanks.
Thank you Michael, uh, but I will have to pass.
I can just run over to the gas station.
Jim! Do you know where I can find Michael Scott?
[as Michael pulls over and stops the car] Please don't stop so suddenly, the seatbelt is pressing on my bladder. Why are you even wearing a seatbelt, you're sitting in the backseat, baby.
THE DUNDIES ARE-OW-ABOUT COMING TOGETHER! AND RECOGNIZING, THE ADOMINABILITY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT! [Jim comes and closes the door]
[whispers to Michael] Michael, I'm very, very bad.
[bad Australian accent attempt] THE DUNDIES!
[recall to Dundies at Louie Volpies] Every day, millions of Americans suffer from extreme repulsiveness. Someone in our midst, is bringing that problem to light. Toby Flenderson, please come up here and accept the Extreme Repulsiveness Award. Oh that's so mean!
Fall asleep right after sex. Huh guys?
Dead man walking.
[at the animal shelter with Andy] You know how I met Jo Bennett? And got started on my ladder of success?
You know what? Uh, it's your last couple days, I'm gonna get out of your hair.
They say he's going to be my right hand man, adlib masturbation joke. [realizing he wasn't supposed to read that directly off the cue card, speaks quietly] No, I hate this, I hate it so much. [loud again] Dwight Schrute! Please accept this promising Assistant Manager Dundie. [people clap as Dwight takes the microphone, he is obviously unenthused] Thank you, thank you so much. I would like to thank something that we, uh, take for granted in our daily lives. And that is the humble trashcan. [Creed nods] This is for you trashcan! [walks off and throws the Dundie into the trashcan]
[laying down, Michael is sitting on DeAngelo's stomach bouncing up and down in Michael's office] Me mo. Me mo.
I used to be obese. Once you've conquered obesity, everything else is easy. Life literally moves in slow motion. I'm not saying I'm superman, but, let me just put it this way. If I were shot in the head, I'm pretty sure everything would be fine. I almost welcome it. [winks]
Congratulations!
This is so weird! If I'm conducting a meeting, good to go. But if I think of it as a performance... I-I fall apart. Obviously.
Awesome! Ani Ani Shelto! Here we come. Do you know how to high-five?
Go do it by yourself, get Ryan.
[very uncomfortable] Look, what ever you're going to do, how long is it going to take? Ballpark. 'Cause I just, I gotta make a decision here. [gets out and slams the door]
Mmhmm.
Oh good!
I know I'm the cause of this royal screw up but I would like to see this show go on.
THE DUNDIES!
When I was very young, my mother divorced my father and I had to go to court and choose between them.
Stop, hitting me.
Gimme that damn dog you f***ing thief! Don't ever do It again! [Andy nods modestly] You hear me?! [Andy nods again] You feel that energy?
[grumbles] Okay whatever.
THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR MOST OF THE EVENING...
Is this an employee of ours?
This was not, part of the job description!
Not while I'm driving.
No one is listening to me! And I'm running out of time!
Where were you on September 11th?
[hands Andy a dog] I'm walking along, out of work. Again. Thinking to myself, 'I only have enough cash to by a sandwich, or get drunk. And I see this guy trying to steal this lady's dog! So I grab the dog. He runs off. She's so grateful, she hires me.
Ughhh, I gotta find Michael Scott! And then I gotta, [Russel Brand impression] Get Him to the Dundies!
[walking out the client's room with Andy] That is cold sir! Absolutely cold. You know what? It was a complete waste of my time.
Maybe I just need to look into my heart. [in the bathroom in front of the mirror] DeAngelo, where is Michael Scott. [his reflection in the mirror turns around to reveal that it is Michael]
I can't. [Michael slaps him again]
That is true, we do share some similarities. I know how you can fix one of those problems, for me it was portion control. For you, you need a key chain. Maybe one with a-
Billy Crystal?
Hello?
[hurriedly, while hiding the chocolate covered chicken] Hey!
[all are in the conference room for Michael's party. Michael isn't there. Jim gives the camera a knowing look] Well if he's not gonna make it at least we should go ahead and eat the cake. [Kevin nods] I for one love the corners. [cuts a corner piece, picks it up with his bare hands, and takes a bite] Why'd I just do that? It's not even that good. I don't even want it. I had cake for lunch. [throws the piece in the garbage] No, you know what? I've been good. I deserve this. [grabs a piece from another corner. The office groans] What am I doing? [chucks it into the trashcan] Come on DeAngelo! [DeAngelo tries to lick the cake, everybody yells no]
