Ichi, ni, san, shi! Ichi, ni, san, shi!
And you know, we're together at school again.
Chinpokomon is what we strive to be great at in our hearts!
As long as we have each other, we'll never have any trouble.
That's what bein' friends is about.
Together at school again. What a special day.
Helen Keller, Helen Keller, blind as a bat.She can't hear us speak. What's up with that?
We'll always be dancin' and singin' aloud. Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh!
You son of a bitch! Rip it down! Get out!
She did it! She did it! Water! Water water aaaaaaaa!
Water, Helen, Water.
We can't believe she did it. The dumb kid really did it.
Water, Helen, Water.
Rice Crispy squares! Yay! All right! Rice Crispy squares!
How can she talk if she can't hear? This is absolutely pointless!
