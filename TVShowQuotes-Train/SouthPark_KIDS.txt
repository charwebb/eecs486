Do dodo dum do dodoDo dodo dum do dodo
Together at school again. What a special day.
Helen Keller, Helen Keller, blind as a bat.She can't hear us speak. What's up with that?
Rice Crispy squares! Yay! All right! Rice Crispy squares!
She's never gonna do it. There's no way she'll ever do it.
Move to the beat and let your spirit out!
How can she talk if she can't hear? This is absolutely pointless!
As long as we have each other, we'll never have any trouble.
That's what bein' friends is about.
You son of a bitch! Rip it down! Get out!
And you know, we're together at school again.
We wish you a merry Christmas,We wish you a merry Christmas,We wish you a merry Christmas--
Ichi, ni, san, shi! Ichi, ni, san, shi!
Chinpokomon is what we strive to be great at in our hearts!
With all of our friends, and you know, we'll be doing this forever.
We'll always be dancin' and singin' aloud. Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh!
