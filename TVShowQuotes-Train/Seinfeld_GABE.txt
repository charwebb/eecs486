Oh? Uh... we haven't started the interview yet. Were you--were you joking?
Ow! Ow! Stephanie, help!
Yes. For Gabe.
Great.
And Gabe-y makes three.
And that's straight from corporate. So not to be scary, but yeah, I would listen to me. And that's all. Ciao.
[holding ball in open palm] Oh, yeah, totally.  Jim, you got ripped off big time.
Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics.
I don't want to say it.
Pam, I don't want to accuse you of anything. I just want everything to be back the way it's supposed to be. Can you just admit... admit...
Do you promise that?
Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV?
Dwight? What are you doing here?
[Robert laughs] I live in this room.
Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis.
Michael, this is irresponsible.
Can you at least
Oh, Jo. Jo, I'm disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was...
You have to cut it out.
I still wear Erin's button-downs around the condo sometimes. So it feels to me like we're still in a relationship-
Five. Six.
I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They���d flex them all night at the discotheque.
Got it.
Very unprofessional, 'Jacques.' Or, should I say, Dwight.
Gabe Lewis.
I've read- and I don't know anything about this personally- but they say prostate stimulation can help.
What recommendation?
I got a tattoo for you.
Can you two please join me in my office? Now.
CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes.
Yeah. But not just bagels. All unwanted problems. Question: What's the most important appliance in your house?
You marked severe in all the categories, including at risk for homicidal behavior.
I get it. Andy's slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam.
- of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, Michael.
Why do you keep repeating - [Michael hangs up]
Apparently, I bear a passing resemblance to Abraham Lincoln. Makes it kind of hard for me to go to places like museums, historical monuments, elementary schools... I don't see it.
Chelsea's Mom: Chelsea, give Mr. Lincoln your hat so I can take a picture.
Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we're still dating?
I'm gonna head back to Siberia there. Ciao. [he and Erin kiss]
I'll just turn the captions on.
Yeah.
Ohh. Dropping bombs, right? [explosion noise] This really make you think, Michael?
Okay... [walks out embarrassed]
I need to talk to you!
Well, that's gonna be tough, because we're getting a dunking clinic from Magic Jordan himself.
It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened.
Well, uh... why don't you just tell me a little about yourself, Hide.
Hmm?
Okay, Quick.
Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels?
Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a fire, so your appointment got-
I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue.
Ok, um, I told the story of your uncle, and I have a feeling that you would have [Michael gesturing behind computer] really been proud of the way... Okay, um...
And that goes double for me. I'll stay even later than you'd like.
You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate. A two-week training program at the Yale school of management, obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities.
This is violent and offensive.
Hey Darryl, I was thinking, uh, maybe while we read through this, uh, you could grab us all some coffee. My treat. It's a hundred dollar bill. Should cover it I think. Don't bring me any of that caramel soy latte crap, ok? I want a decaf frappuccino. Val���
I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.
[dressed as Lady Gaga] In case you can't read m-m-my Poker Face... [laughs] we will be reviewing our sales policies. [accepts note from Michael, reads it out loud] I have ten seconds to read them or this whole place blows up.
Little cups? Like paper or plastic or... ?
It's like a hula hoop. Right. Mele Kalikimaka is the wise way.
What's in it for GSL?
Uh, excuse me, excuse me. How does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming?
Speed set. One. Two.
What kind of music are you into, Peter?
...I'm sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations.
Uh, not now.
I'm such a klutz!
Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN! [slams fist, hurting his hand]
Well, you have a job to do. Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales.
Good. Well, that's the spirit.
Well... it's just... [ringing] it messes up my rhythm.
I will make this sexier than you could ever imagine.
Hey, Andy?
We have a policy here at Sabre where we are, uh, allowed to take two weeks.
Okay, I-I am, I'm almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. [Robert and Gabe chuckle at this, then Gabe stops chuckling] Do you, um, do you think that you are?
Too kind doesn't begin to cover it.
Well... it's an interview, and we don't know that you really have the plan.
It���s one of the most common fetishes.
My entire childhood, I was the one left out, and I said to myself: Gabe, if you just achieve some success, you'll be part of them. You'll be part of the happy ones. But instead, people just used my success as a new way to shut me out.
The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don't respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I'm the I.T. guy. This Cookie Monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I'm an authority figure.
Hey. I need you to get the paperwork rolling on a new workplace relationship.
First thing's first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would've just looped back to me, so, it's cool you recognized my role here.
The cinema of the unsettling is a growing film movement.  The most well known film in the genre is an hour long shot of a squirrel with diarrhea.
[reveals Stanley's moustache] Ah! Ha ha ha!
No. [Robert then nods his head at Jim]
[stands up and walks to stage, takes the microphone] Well, this is embarrassing, um, I'm obviously really angry at Erin. It's that quarter life crisis everyone's been talking about. [Jim is looking wide eyed, jaw dropped] Alright I'm gonna go. [Dwight plays cricket noises]
[Andy walks by with DeAngelo, says quietly after he leaves] Walk away bitch.
I have no idea.
Oh my God, I can't look at roaches.
Just read the letter under your windshield wiper, it explains everything. Quick one. [leans in for a kiss]
[Andy is leaning over toilet] What happened?
[laughs] Total brain burp.
What?
This wasn't really about Meredith was it. You and Erin are broken up.
They're going to be pretty pleased in Tallahassee that I snagged an Indian for the program. She'll be the first. The program's mostly black. It's almost too black. That didn't sound right.
[sounding hurt] I'm either going to quit today, or stay to make sure that Andy's career is destroyed.
So leave.
Uh uh. Corporate stole nothing, okay? Darryl told me, and then I told them, giving Darryl full credit, so... no need to [mimicking Andy] screw corporate! Or anything like that, so. Let's give Darryl a round of applause, as planned. [claps]
The problem, unfortunately, is about the office administrator. I have gone through everything for the past three years. There is nothing that says you are the office administrator.
It's for protecting my ass. When you suckers lift more than you can handle. Sup, I'm Gabe. Corporate. Continue. Don't be nervous.
Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets.
You don't really toss the dough.
[to Cathy] Well, we'll say its eight-two and it'll be our secret.
Thank you so much.
I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who don't get the reference, making them feel like the other.
You're right, we don't need a hat.
I can see you in the jungle now.
Michael! You are making this harder than it has to be.
That'd be hilarious. Uh, 'Jo, they're creating a hostile work environment. Stop  'em.'
I'm gonna keep trying Jo.
Yeah.
You must be pretty horny. [Erin shakes head no]
[enters] Happy birthday to Gabe!
Because I am. I need to get her back. [crying] I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?
Oh, come on. My rules could not possibly have been that oppressive.
Yeah, but she's not white, though.
[laughs] Oh no no no no no no. She wouldn't even let me say it. It was adorable. She would plug her ears and scream her heat out.
Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities.
Erin you don't have to...
No, not nice. Terrible. Doesn't even include the fact that they're dogs.
This is Michael Scott, co-regional manager of this branch.
Actually, that's Nick. He's your new IT guy. Uh, he's setting up a site blocker. Mostly blocking the inappropriate sites.  And then there are the time-wasting sites like Twitter, YouTube. We are blocking those as well.
Yes?
I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he's a rat, and I think he's responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,... he broke up the happiest couple in this office!
I dominate Valentine's Day. I practically make romance into a science.
You never know with Jo. Sometimes we're here til midnight. Sometimes she doesn't show up for three days.
Oh, close. It's a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck.
I'll let this slide, but I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you.
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Sweetheart.
So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation?
[lowers volum] Some of us are trying to have a conversation.
Yeah. He told me you two broke up.
Will do... Can I get one of those name plates... that says Gabe Lewis?
[walking back into the office] That was ugly. I'm sorry you had to see that.
Um, hi, uh, my name is Gabe Lewis. I am coordinating director for merging regions.
Uh.
Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy.
[walking with Jim and Pam] Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life.
Um. I set my stuff up in there. So...  just give me a few minutes to clean that out for you.
You had something important to tell me?
Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for.
They don't touch. They don't kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife.
...a lot of the time.
Ok, well, I bet you can fit 20 little cups of water in your aluminum bottle.
Was it Pam?
Yes, it is.
You know, there's this expression: Bro's before Ho's. And what that's short for is brothers before whores. Uh, I don't buy that. I would throw any brother under the bus for any whore. Woman.
Corporate says to me, ���Gabe, we need you in Scranton.��� Scranton says, ���Gabe, go back down to Florida. You're needed there.��� So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm up there. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I'm down here. I can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying.
[as Michael and Jo leave] Are you leaving? Oh, am I... should I continue with the investigation?
[bell dings] Guys, that's the elevator. What if it's him?
Yay Robert!
Okay, guys, fun is fun, but-
Okay, why don't we simplify this? Darryl brings it to Michael, Michael brings it to me, no one calls Jo.
Number two: no pop culture references.
Well, it's nine miles away. I'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf.
Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women's room.
First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you'd expect to hear from corporate. Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances.
How many windows are there in New York City?
No, I'm gonna stand where I want. Okay? You don't wanna get on my bad side! I've seen some horrible things! I own over two hundred horror movies!
Well, I wish that I could do something, but it's kind of policy, you know? Above my pay grade. You know?
I've got just the thing! [leaves, comes back with a synthesizer] This one's called Earth Rise, on the Moon. [music plays]
Ooh.
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
Right, of course!
Yeah.
I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen.
Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. Kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor. [clapping] All right.
But you do. You are in charge -
They don't make these cords in boot cut anymore!
Ok, but once this starts, it's going to be moving fast. It's going to be hot and heavy and I don't want a bunch of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around my jock. You know?
Intercepted!
Erin and I make great use of ours.
I'm back! Ha ha. Pam, perfect. I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem.
Ok, did everyone get one? With these bottles, we eliminate the need for plastic water bottles, which are the scourge of the environment.
Okay, while this is interesting we should get back to work. These stand-offs can last a long time. What if it's another Waco.
Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?
You know, times were tough. I was unemployed, I was still heart-broken over you, I've lost a good fifty pounds. But as you can see I put all that weight right back on. Feel how fat my buttocks are. Yeah, it's crazy. Touch it. It's like a warm pumpkin.
Monday's suck.
That's very nice. [referring to Kelly's bindi] I never noticed that before.
That sounds like a promotion!
Ok. Ok there. I heard that. So I'm sorry, Pam, but that's it. I'm going to have to suspend you without pay for two days.
Nice pelvic bowl. Deep.
[on the phone] You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right. [hangs up]
Too late! Oh. Ha. An IM chat. Very clever. I'll just print that out. Come on guys. Grow up. I don't want to be your babysitter.
Maybe you find your own chair.
I'm not sure the temporary replacement of an H.R. rep really warrants a party.
Okay. That's great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else.
I would also like to toast Robert California. Mr. California,...
Toby I'm going to tell you her last name tomorrow because she's going to be screaming it tonight.
Are you still in love with Erin?
Yes, I am.
Yes.  Lars and Decocco���s
Everyone, our very own Angela-
[on videochat]  First let me say that I told them everything you wanted me to say, in just the way you wanted me to say it, so...
[to Toby] I hear them kissing all the time. It's this horrible plipping sound. You know, it's like Chinese water torture. Just...[makes popping sound] like it's coming from my own head.
I have shaved everything...
Hey! Watch it.
Great! [to Jim and Toby] Um, can we just... [does a 'wrap it up' motion with his pen]
Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again?
I know.
Oh, I am so in.
You're doing great. You know, so good.
Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe.
[walks in] Gotta catch a plane.
That is not how it seems to me.
[on voicemail] You've reached Gabe Lewis, I'm currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao. [beep]
[on phone] Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out.
No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it's reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. One: You're taking MDMA. Street name, ecstasy. I've done it, and I know the feeling.
Oh boy. Can you get every department head's signature on this so I can back this up to corporate?
The puzzle is the clue.
Okay, that's not gonna be...
What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. And... you did it. [nods at Andy]
I don't wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad.
I'm your boss!
[sees Andy walk into the Men's Room and follows him in] Stay away from Erin! [cornering him in the bathroom]
Whoops.
Just do it. You were the it that I was just doing.
Nudity makes me uncomfortable.
Why don't we say ciao to the impressions? [everyone says ciao]
Good morning. [suitcase falls and he laughs awkwardly]
Mm-hmm.
There are plenty of people who love touching me. [camera zooms to Ryan, who looks at the camera, extremely skeptical] I'm a terrific hugger. I've been with a bunch of girls where that's basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.
Oh, how the mediocre have fallen.
Whoa! That's a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.
Yeah. I don't want to be offensive but, uh... may I ask you what that means?
Really? All kinds? So you like songs of hate written by the white knights of the Ku Klux Klan?
It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some 'Slumdog Millionaire' scenario, where every word she's playing has a connection to her orphan past. It's possible.
Tasteless?
I don't know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah.
Those overnight packages needed to go out, and Michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable.
Okay. We're going to table the hat question. The best ideas are going to come to me, I make the final decision, period.
[takes remote] It's a little loud...
Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology.
No, no, I'm-
Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.
No! We really shouldn't be without a receptionist. Now more than ever.
Okay, good.
Uh, it's a condo and it's long-term business housing.
Honestly, it was a little weird.
I get the sense that Val enjoys a good putdown. Considering that's the only thing I know about her. I will be milking that hard. [Gestures milking a cow]
This is just, uh- This American Life, I think I heard it on.
Oh, this is 'Print in All Colors,' Sabre's minority executive training program.
More tasteless than this...'is that a palm tree or did Gabe get skinnier? Either way, let's pee on it.'  [laughter]
What?
We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so... [nods]
Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood. [laughs] Not every day.
Oh, is it okay with you? Because if it's not, you work for me, so... Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and contracts governing our business. Be honest, fair-
I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out. You said, and I quote, 'My good sir! Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand.' I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way.
Core���s critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One ��� lengthen. Two ��� elongate.
When you're dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like. I wish my gym didn't allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. 'Cause it's policy. See what I mean?
Hey...
We are very impressed with this branch and we are so excited about this merger.
Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview.
Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It's come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or e-mail this around.
Michael, you just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private?
So, tonight I was thinking, I'm gonna go to the cemetery. I'm gonna drink a little wine and I thought maybe you'd like to come with me.
That is Jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office.
Droswip, yeah.  I get it.  Okay, we're gonna get you to the restroom.
Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit is to call this a stress-induced outburst.  You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling.
Hey, guys.
Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important. [Pam hands Jim a note] It's not about showing you're in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It's about forgiveness. And yes, I'm talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension.
Yeah, unless somebody else applies today.
I'm not technically seeing her, but uh I've seen her, with the eyes and uh there was attraction. In at least one direction. So..[holds up fist]
Yup. We could watch some right now if you want. I got a Korean film on my iPod if you want to just- if you have the cables.
Butt honking. Yeah, all the honking.
[to Andy] I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400,000. [smiles] We've investigated. Every time it's been user error.  They block the vents or something, I don't know. That's why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I'd like to reward you for that. [pulls out gift card] That's god for five bucks at Dunkin' Donuts. Any Dunkin' Donuts. [Andy looks over at Darryl and Darryl motions for Andy to go to him]
Whom I'm seeing is Val from down in the warehouse.
Give me one night with you...
Uh, it was.
Hey, Jim? Are you distracting these people?
I started dating Erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite.
The Michelin man called, he wants his cummerbund back.
Okay...
I don't really see what the problem is. Erin doesn't even like sex, remember? You said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton.
[ahem][Pam snores] Guys?
Nope.
I don't want to hear it. Suspended.
We got it?
I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.
Ok.
They say that if you can strengthen your core, it improves your sexual performance. So, you will find me on the Ab-Blaster. And then you will find me blasting...uh, a very nice young woman.
No! You go away! [storms out, toilet flushes, Jim exits the bathroom]
Go get 'em. Start quipin'.
Hey.
Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard. [Erin looks shocked] Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what - what God is. But for all of the disbelief [phone rings] I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum [phone continues ringing] out... there... uh, do we not have voicemail?
Your wish is my command.
Oh, I don't get that sense at all from you, so...
Erin, I've been to Japan. I know how to use chopsticks so well. Come back. One night.
No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying.
Yeah it seems like there isn���t a narrative. [on screen a man gets into a car]  Maybe the filmmaker realized that even narrative is comforting.
Well Darryl, considering that I basically own the place, I'm just chillin' at mi casa. This is me, in repose..I suppose.
No... How far away is the Sun?
Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. It's either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed.
320.  Just freeballin' it.
Sure. Basically, there's no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem.
What do you want me to say? I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. [to Jim and Toby] Are we all just gonna pretend to-- okay. [to Kelly] Um, what are your weaknesses?
No no. No no no.
Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the shortlist for next time there's an opening.
I technically cannot. I don't have the lung capacity to blow a whistle.
You have to be a minority.
Oh, uh, no. No, no, no, no. I'm, uh, I'm actually with a tour group myself, so- [laughter] Hello! I'm Abraham Lincoln! Some people call me the great emancipator, but, uh, you might know me from the penny. [laughter]
To Robert California, from the moment you entered our building and our hearts, you...
I don't - it's just...
So what, no one's even gonna try?
At all.
Ok where does Gabe factor in?
All right.
That is correct.
Wait, wait, you think she invented 'Talla-nasty?' [chuckles] no, no, no, no���
We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that.
All right. Uh, Stan, you're up.
Ow! He went home.
Corporate wants me up here, Dunder Mifflin wants me down there. What they worked out is that Monday, Wednesday and Friday I'm here in Scranton, Tuesday Thursday I'm in Tallahassee, I mean I feel like Vera Farmiga in Up in the Air, you know? More money more problems. Although, I didn't get a raise, so you know. Same money, more problems.
A little un-specific.
I love maternity wards. It's the perfect blend of love and horror. Things can go so wrong or so right.
Okay.
Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk.
Yep! Waste not right?
Nice guy.
Course I know.
Well, Toby's in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby's done a fine job.
Darn it Bob. I told you not to buy a Sabre brand lifeboat.' [laughter]
Steve Martin. [laughs, then falls] uh, I'm fine. [grunts]
Um, actually, if you don't mind, I would love to put this on the Sabre website. [correctly pronounced 'say-ber']
Uh, I think you���re gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. [chuckles] It���ll be upsetting if you don���t.
You have some food on your face.
You know what? Let me see what I can do.
Erin, I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God. [Erin and Angela both look taken aback]
So I got us a compromise. This movie's called 'Hardware'. It tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like Wall-e, that the government invented to destroy humans. It's some of what you like and some of what I like, and... married...
I'm sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on. [Jim and Pam struggling to stay awake] Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way?
Look at this, this is enormous.
Okay. So, PDAs. That's gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh...
Come on.
You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the gang.
Shove his sashimi!
Okay, you know what, you don't need to make that sound.
That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves.
I can't believe I didn't think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel! Why are you talking to Stanley's mistress?
Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush! [Gabe makes a flushing motion, Dwight twists Gabe's arm] Ow!
Okay, well, obviously if it's a really, really good idea, my door is open.
Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat.
Yeah we had a whole conversation about Mondays���
[as Lincoln] I just don't understand. It's 1865, victory is ours, I've saved the very soul of our nation, and yet... happiness eludes me. Oh, perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits.
Can I buy everyone coffees? [everyone shakes their heads] [in Cookie Monster voice] 'Or cookies.'
No. I don't like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?
Decaf frap-
See ya Oscar! [Oscar leaves]
How much?
Umm... 'You don't have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, I'm the only one here.' Ha.
[talking on the phone] So I can reprimand them but I can't suspend them. Oh I can't do either. Uh huh. Fair enough.
How would we know that, if you don't...
Yeah, booby honking. Sure.
Ok. [office laughs] No no no.
No, I was not.
Well...
Give or take. [Deangelo walks out]
Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim. [Dwight starts to clap] Ok fine. You too Dwight.
Well, get to work.
Did someone say girl talk?
Oh, well I'm still the corporate liaison to the branch.
Umm, Pam?
