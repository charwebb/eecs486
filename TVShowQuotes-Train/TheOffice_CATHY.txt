No I should go fill out my paperwork.
Sorry, um, I'll just go ask Oscar.
It was from a deleted scene so we were both right.
Okay, yeah.
[to Jim] Oh, that line from Zoolander?
Can you��� without running to the other side of the room all night?
I don't know. He's not picking up.
I think everything is under control.
Um, do I hand in my expense reports to a particular accountant or-
LeBron James.
So you���re a blogger right?
Um, it might be fun if each store had a different theme, like a beach one, a winter one, a jungle one.
Yeah, one death by chocolate, one bananas foster��� Okay, cool. Thanks��� I know, I'm a pig, right?
[to Jim] Hey, late guy.
Oh my God, what are you thinking?
Seriously disgusting.
Aah! Stop, it, oh my god! That burns! what is that?!
Hey, uh, good. Uh, the heating system though in my room is all messed up. It's like 90 degrees in there. Maintenance is working on it. Can I hang out here?
Stop it! [runs out the door]
Can I see?
Well, that's how I played it in college.
Oh stop it, stop it, stop it!
My cousins were actually at those Olympics.
Cool��� [Jumps onto bed] Is this March Madness? I love March Madness.
I can't breathe!
God, stay away. Oh, I always get in trouble around bloggers. I���m trying to be a good girl for once.
Yeah, take your time.
Thank you-
Okay, yeah. Who's going to be my partner? Where's Jim?
[coughs and moans]
[in a bathrobe] Is crazy gone?
Are you okay?
Ugh, we're gonna have one of those crazy nights, aren't we? Maybe we'll see the real 'Talla-nasty' we've been hearing so much about.
So, I get to kick you now.
Is this really nessecary?
Ugh, god, I feel so gross. I have to go take a shower.
How was the drive?
You should sit down.
Cool, for your kids?
Okay. [Sits next to Jim.] I am so cold.
[giggles]
[giggles] Wait, this why I exercise like a fiend. Feel. Seriously.
Jeez���
It's almost too warm.
Well that was just one idea. It doesn't have to be winter.
