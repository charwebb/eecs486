Can you��� without running to the other side of the room all night?
What? Oh, Jim, I thought we talked about this. You're cool, right?
Well that was just one idea. It doesn't have to be winter.
Okay. [Sits next to Jim.] I am so cold.
Ugh, we're gonna have one of those crazy nights, aren't we? Maybe we'll see the real 'Talla-nasty' we've been hearing so much about.
It's almost too warm.
How was the drive?
Ugh. Kill me. That was my idea.
I think everything is under control.
Cool, for your kids?
Um, it might be fun if each store had a different theme, like a beach one, a winter one, a jungle one.
I can't breathe!
Can I see?
Seriously disgusting.
My cousins were actually at those Olympics.
Okay, yeah. Who's going to be my partner? Where's Jim?
Hey, uh, good. Uh, the heating system though in my room is all messed up. It's like 90 degrees in there. Maintenance is working on it. Can I hang out here?
Sorry, um, I'll just go ask Oscar.
God, stay away. Oh, I always get in trouble around bloggers. I���m trying to be a good girl for once.
I haven't seen anything.
Yeah, take your time.
Stop it! [runs out the door]
So you���re a blogger right?
I don't know. He's not picking up.
Oh my God, what are you thinking?
[in a bathrobe] Is crazy gone?
I know that you're married, I sat at your wife's desk. How little do you think of me?
You should sit down.
Well, that's how I played it in college.
[to Jim] Hey, late guy.
So, I get to kick you now.
Is this really nessecary?
[to Jim] Oh, that line from Zoolander?
Thank you-
Are you okay?
It was from a deleted scene so we were both right.
Ugh, god, I feel so gross. I have to go take a shower.
[giggles] Wait, this why I exercise like a fiend. Feel. Seriously.
Oh stop it, stop it, stop it!
No I should go fill out my paperwork.
Aah! Stop, it, oh my god! That burns! what is that?!
Cool��� [Jumps onto bed] Is this March Madness? I love March Madness.
LeBron James.
[coughs and moans]
[giggles]
