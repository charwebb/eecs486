I think everything is under control.
Seriously disgusting.
Are you okay?
[coughs and moans]
God, stay away. Oh, I always get in trouble around bloggers. I���m trying to be a good girl for once.
Okay. [Sits next to Jim.] I am so cold.
Ugh, we're gonna have one of those crazy nights, aren't we? Maybe we'll see the real 'Talla-nasty' we've been hearing so much about.
Yeah, one death by chocolate, one bananas foster��� Okay, cool. Thanks��� I know, I'm a pig, right?
Well that was just one idea. It doesn't have to be winter.
Um, it might be fun if each store had a different theme, like a beach one, a winter one, a jungle one.
[giggles] Wait, this why I exercise like a fiend. Feel. Seriously.
No I should go fill out my paperwork.
Is this really nessecary?
It was from a deleted scene so we were both right.
Okay, yeah.
I haven't seen anything.
Yeah, take your time.
Stop it! [runs out the door]
Can you��� without running to the other side of the room all night?
LeBron James.
[in a bathrobe] Is crazy gone?
So you���re a blogger right?
Hey, uh, good. Uh, the heating system though in my room is all messed up. It's like 90 degrees in there. Maintenance is working on it. Can I hang out here?
Well, that's how I played it in college.
Aah! Stop, it, oh my god! That burns! what is that?!
What? Oh, Jim, I thought we talked about this. You're cool, right?
My cousins were actually at those Olympics.
Oh my God, what are you thinking?
[to Jim] Oh, that line from Zoolander?
Jeez���
Okay, yeah. Who's going to be my partner? Where's Jim?
How was the drive?
Sorry, um, I'll just go ask Oscar.
Um, do I hand in my expense reports to a particular accountant or-
It's almost too warm.
Thank you-
Ugh, god, I feel so gross. I have to go take a shower.
[to Jim] Hey, late guy.
Oh stop it, stop it, stop it!
So, I get to kick you now.
Can I see?
Cool, for your kids?
I can't breathe!
I know that you're married, I sat at your wife's desk. How little do you think of me?
Cool��� [Jumps onto bed] Is this March Madness? I love March Madness.
