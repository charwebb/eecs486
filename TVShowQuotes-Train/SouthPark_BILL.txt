May I hold your Trapper Keeper?

You asked for the help of the American Catholic League, let us do our job! Take him! 

Yeah.

Enough of this blasphemy! I'm the Pope now! That means I am the voice of God!

Huhuh.  Oh crap, they're coming in the back!  That's gay. 

Gaagghhh! 

That's gay.

Huh, huh.

Stupid.

I was held back ten human grades.  I mean, grades. Do you companion-friends know Eric Cartman?

Got it!

Yeah, it's probably a gay pig too.

You are soft! Weak! You leave me no choice: take them! 

Mornin' Gil.

Well, Fat Abbot and the gang sure done learned somethin' today. If you have a stepdad ridin' your ass, just snatch his ass in a bear trap. Grine! No more stepdad. See ya next time eatin' the pudding.

Wagh!

Huh huh, meh, yeah, maybe you should take him to a Barbara Streisand concert.  Stupid little gay dog.

Can we play some human tetherball?

That's gay. 

Yeah, maybe you should name your dog Sparkette, Stan.

Serve! 

Eric Cartman?  And you have a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000?

We swear it, on the cross.

Yeahh, they're all gay.

Heheh. Heheh.

He goes against the Church. He must die!

Kill him!

Nooo! Listen to me! I am not really Bill Cosby.  My name is BSM-471. I am a cyborg engineered by humans from the year 2034.

Huhuh.

rr uh rr uh, uhhhh. 

It is what Christ would've wanted!

Lock up those two Jews!  We'll deal with them later.

Waa-agggh! 

Hopefully not a gay clone.

Oh, I see. Alright, I'll pay 100 geliga stones-- Uh, I mean, human dollars! Eugh, I mean dollars!

Ahhh, hello Eric. Can I be your human friend?  I mean, friend?

Take them into custody! 

That Trapper Keeper has to be destroyed!

Yes. Yes, I do.

Don't be soft, Your Holiness! These "whores" must be punished in front of everyone!

Please. You do not understand.

Please. We can have fun and play games, like human four square--  I mean, four square.

Ya see? 

The child who has the rabbit has to know that we are willing to kill the hostages if he doesn't hand it over.

Yeah, you want to be my girlfriend? Huhuh. 

Yeah. Too bad for you... it was a double cross! 

My people! This Easter I'm gonna start by making our rabbit stew ten times meatier! 

Hooray. 

That's gay. 

Why won't you go away?!
