Don't be soft, Your Holiness! These "whores" must be punished in front of everyone!

Wagh!

Enough of this blasphemy! I'm the Pope now! That means I am the voice of God!

The child who has the rabbit has to know that we are willing to kill the hostages if he doesn't hand it over.

Eric Cartman?  And you have a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000?

Heheh. Heheh.

We swear it, on the cross.

You are no longer able to fulfill your duties to the Lord!  The Easter vigil will go on as planned!  Every Hare Club member, young and old, will watch as their precious savior dies!

May I hold your Trapper Keeper?

My people! This Easter I'm gonna start by making our rabbit stew ten times meatier! 

Got it!

Huh huh, meh, yeah, maybe you should take him to a Barbara Streisand concert.  Stupid little gay dog.

That's gay. 

Huh, huh.

Ahhh, hello Eric. Can I be your human friend?  I mean, friend?

Serve! 

It is what Christ would've wanted!

Ya see? 

Waa-agggh! 

Yeahh, they're all gay.

rr uh rr uh, uhhhh. 

Well, Fat Abbot and the gang sure done learned somethin' today. If you have a stepdad ridin' your ass, just snatch his ass in a bear trap. Grine! No more stepdad. See ya next time eatin' the pudding.

Huhuh.  Oh crap, they're coming in the back!  That's gay. 

Mornin' Gil.

Why won't you go away?!

Hopefully not a gay clone.

Lock up those two Jews!  We'll deal with them later.

Please. We can have fun and play games, like human four square--  I mean, four square.

Yeah, it's probably a gay pig too.

Take them into custody! 

I've been using the 12-step program for about two months now and, and I'm really turning my life around. No more blowing guys on Colfax Avenue for a pint of vodka for THIS cowboy! 

Yeah, maybe you should name your dog Sparkette, Stan.

You are soft! Weak! You leave me no choice: take them! 

He goes against the Church. He must die!

Kill him!

Huhuh.

That's gay.

Please. You do not understand.

Yeah, you want to be my girlfriend? Huhuh. 

Oh, I see. Alright, I'll pay 100 geliga stones-- Uh, I mean, human dollars! Eugh, I mean dollars!

Yeah. Too bad for you... it was a double cross! 

I was held back ten human grades.  I mean, grades. Do you companion-friends know Eric Cartman?

That's gay.

That's gay. 

Check upstairs!  Upstairs clear! Try the office! 

Hooray. 

You asked for the help of the American Catholic League, let us do our job! Take him! 

Can we play some human tetherball?

Nooo! Listen to me! I am not really Bill Cosby.  My name is BSM-471. I am a cyborg engineered by humans from the year 2034.

Behold, no longer will Easter be about bunnies and colored eggs! Kill the rabbit!
