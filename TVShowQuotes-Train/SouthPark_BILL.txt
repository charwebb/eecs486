My people! This Easter I'm gonna start by making our rabbit stew ten times meatier! 
Please. We can have fun and play games, like human four square--  I mean, four square.
Yeah. Too bad for you... it was a double cross! 
I've been using the 12-step program for about two months now and, and I'm really turning my life around. No more blowing guys on Colfax Avenue for a pint of vodka for THIS cowboy! 
You asked for the help of the American Catholic League, let us do our job! Take him! 
He goes against the Church. He must die!
You are no longer able to fulfill your duties to the Lord!  The Easter vigil will go on as planned!  Every Hare Club member, young and old, will watch as their precious savior dies!
You are soft! Weak! You leave me no choice: take them! 
I was held back ten human grades.  I mean, grades. Do you companion-friends know Eric Cartman?
Lock up those two Jews!  We'll deal with them later.
Enough of this blasphemy! I'm the Pope now! That means I am the voice of God!
Eric Cartman?  And you have a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000?
Nooo! Listen to me! I am not really Bill Cosby.  My name is BSM-471. I am a cyborg engineered by humans from the year 2034.
Behold, no longer will Easter be about bunnies and colored eggs! Kill the rabbit! 
Don't be soft, Your Holiness! These "whores" must be punished in front of everyone!
Well, Fat Abbot and the gang sure done learned somethin' today. If you have a stepdad ridin' your ass, just snatch his ass in a bear trap. Grine! No more stepdad. See ya next time eatin' the pudding.
Oh, I see. Alright, I'll pay 100 geliga stones-- Uh, I mean, human dollars! Eugh, I mean dollars!
Huh huh, meh, yeah, maybe you should take him to a Barbara Streisand concert.  Stupid little gay dog.
Yeah, you want to be my girlfriend? Huhuh. 
Huhuh.  Oh crap, they're coming in the back!  That's gay. 
Yeah, maybe you should name your dog Sparkette, Stan.
