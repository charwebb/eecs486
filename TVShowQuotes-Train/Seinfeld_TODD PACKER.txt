[rapping] What's up my nerds. Check it out. [points at the mistletoe stuck down his pants]
[on the phone] Bergerstein!
bleep, bleep. What's up, Halpert?
[on the phone] Bergerstein!
I am. It was my rock bottom.
Huh. The mind sees what it wants to, huh? [hands cupcake to Erin] There you go.
Meant to ask you, can you think you can get someone to drive me around because of the, uh, DUI situation?
It's OK. I'm over it.
There he is.
Oh my. They really got to you, didn't they?
There's this guy. He's at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched 'cause all these women are smokin' hot perfect 10's, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh... [points at Phyllis]
They are women, right?
Yep
[on the phone] I... I'm not coming.
Hey, Moonface. Nice to see those shiny, little Chinese eyes of yours.
[on the phone] Is this Michael Scott? My secret lover. My intercom, I told you never to call me here. Never! [Michael's laughing]
What, you, I, I can't get fired. I'm an institution. I have been at this company for 20 years. How many of you have been here that long, huh? [Dwight exits meeting room and helps Jim up]
Sup?
[high-pitched voice] I saw you on the news and I want to pinch your tiny wiener...  [normal voice] It's Packer!
Hey, uh, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for screwing you.
Why does everyone ask me that? Who the hell is that?
I am going through a twelve-step program. I'm currently on step zero. Which is have a [expletive] of fun. I spent six hours carefully removing the frosting and then layering in a variety of drugs, some legal, some not. Some laxative, some constipating. You don't fire the Pac-Man and expect to get away with it.
I don���t see what that gets us, but I���m a team player.
There he is. Good one.
[on the phone] I want my money back you greedy Hebrew. Bergerstein!
I said it. And then, suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a bitch.
Schrute���s out to get me. But I���m playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator.
Pacman need a drinky.
Oh. I'm Todd. Oh, sorry for calling you a fat, little runt earlier.
Fat and ugly. You might actually have a chance.
Still queer?
Hey what's up, Butt-plug?
[on the phone] Mello.
Oh here's what you do. Hike up your skirt and pull out your tampon, borrow some balls and come meet me!
I don't think you get it.
[sounds sick on the phone] I can't make it.
Lame. Why don't witches wear panties?
So a guy goes home, tells his wife, 'Honey. Pack your bags. I just won the lottery.' She goes, 'Oh my god! That's incredible! Where are we going?' He goes, 'I don't know where you're going, just be out of here by five!' [men laugh] Boom!
Actually, they have a specific way I need to do this. And, I have to go through examples of stuff.  OK. Uh, where to begin. [to Pam] Hey. Pam-pam and her pam-pams. Wow. I have said some crude things about those. But, they are beautiful. And, I guess that's why I acted out. Pam, I'm sorry I objectified you. And, personified your breasts. Sorry, guys. [to Phyllis] Oh boy. I have not been nice to you. Philly, I'm sorry for the things I said about your size. To your face, behind your back, and in the form of drawings. Actually, that goes to all you double XLs. Stanley, Kevin, [points to Clark] this kid in a few years.
Aw, I'm just trying to-
[to Ryan] Come on, kid. Let's go.
Dude, I've been here since three! I've boot and rallied twice.
I've been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes?
Like 10 words a minute... talking.
[on the phone] Oh, God! Stop whining. You know, you only come to the pick up game once a year. You little bitch. [Michael picks up phone, takes it off speakerphone] All right, yup. Hey, okay. No problem, you know, best you can do. Hey, you know. Hey, nice talking to you too. All right take care. [sighs] Michael Scoot. That's funny. He's a good friend.
Well, looks like Shnoot's a no-show. Guess he wasn't vice presy material after all. But I am. Put me in, babe. I got the info down backwards, forwards, and doggy-style. I'm your man.
If I may speak to that, I have only been vice president of this project for the last half hour, so the man you want is Dwight Shrute.
OK. Let's get right to it. I guess. My name is Todd Packer and I am in recovery. I'm working the steps. I'm on step eight of Alcoholics Anonymous and step nine of Narcotics Anonymous. I'm here to make amends. I've been hard to deal with over the past years. Kind of a jerk. I know it. I don't need you to accept my apology, but I'd love it if you did.
Are you kidding? Everyone knows why! You don't know? Okay, check this out. Al lright. So here's the story. So Randall is nailing his secretary, right? And she is totally incompetent.
Maybe next 'queer.' Hey ladies, who wants some bangers and mash?
That's... that's the same guy. It's the joke I made.
No? Wow. I'm in this mode now where I'm apologizing for thoughts that are in my head. [Clark fake laughs] Hey. I have a crazy feeling [hands Clark a cupcake] that you are really gonna like this.
Uh���
Because they need to grip the broom!
[grabbing Michael around the neck] Merry Christmas, asswipe!
Why can't I just be nice? Truth is, I really like you guys. I really do. OK. The apology���s just half of it. The big thing is making amends. And, that's why I brought these. I went out to the Steamtown Mall and I got you all cupcakes. From that place 'Nipples'.
So, that's it. I just wanted to make amends. [slides cupcakes across table to Darryl and Jim]
Has anyone started calling you 'Gabe-wad' yet?
When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how 'bout I pop up also? I guess we'd have to say 'power of three'. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works. [to Nellie] You'd spin off right. I'd spin off-
Whoops! [Humps Michael]
Hi, all.
We're talking blonde incompetent.
Ex-squeeze me?
Halpert, you lookin' for someone to bang your wife?
[makes laser gun noises]
Hey, you know what? It was, uh, great to see you all again. Take care. [exits]
