My mother...was taken from my house by the Communists in the middle of the night when I was ten years old. She was sent to a slave labor camp, where she labored for twelve years. Finally, they released her and she was on a boat to America to re-unite with us...but she was served some bad fish, and she died...on the high seas.
Kramer, did I ever tell you about my mother? My mother -
Ah, Jerry! Tonight you in for a real treat. I'm personnaly going to prepare the dinner for you and my Audrey.
...but the Communists, they put an end to that! So, on this issue there is no debate! And no intelligent person can think differently.
Because it's a pizza!
They owe me for those ducks. They were flown in from Newfoundland.
The what? (Looks at Kramer, and exits.)
Visiting my friend.
Oh, very good ducks.
(to Jerry) Well?
You're not welcome!
It's a pizza the moment you put your fists in the dough!
That's not a pizza. It'll taste terrible.
Use your wrist! It's all in the wrist. (Kramer tosses the dough way up there.) Not too high!
It's you! It's you!
No.
Don't they know I have a gastro-intestinal disorder? If I would have any of this, I would die. Then Poppie's no good to anyone! This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie. How could you be friends with those two?
You! I... I gotta sit down!
Oh, hello, Jerry.
Don't fill up on the bread. I'm making you a very special dinner. Very special. (he leaves)
Yes, it is!
Here it is.
Yes, but we cannot give the people the right to choose any topping they want! Now on this issue there can be no debate!
Oh, much better, much better. The doctors say I cannot have no aggravation.
Sweetheart, hello.
When my mother was abducted by the Communists, she was with child...
Hello.
That's fine. If you just give me my duck money, I'll be on my way.
She start the big fight, about abortion.
And what gives you the right to do that?
No, no. You can't put cucumbers on a pizza.
What's this? A bottle of wine and a five-alarm chili? They're trying to kill Poppie?!
So, I sell the restaurant, uh? I just take it easy. See, if I get excited, 'ats aggravated my condition. The last time I got aggravated, was in the restaurant. With your friend.
Let me show you to your table. (Leads Jerry and Elaine to the table.) Your duck is cooking as we speak. It is so succulent...so succulent!
Not too much!
I'm Poppie.
What's the problem?
Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck...it is more succulent than even I had hoped.
