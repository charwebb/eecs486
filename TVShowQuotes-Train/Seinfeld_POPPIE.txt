Ah, Jerry! Tonight you in for a real treat. I'm personnaly going to prepare the dinner for you and my Audrey.
No, no. You can't put cucumbers on a pizza.
Yes, but we cannot give the people the right to choose any topping they want! Now on this issue there can be no debate!
What's this? A bottle of wine and a five-alarm chili? They're trying to kill Poppie?!
My mother...was taken from my house by the Communists in the middle of the night when I was ten years old. She was sent to a slave labor camp, where she labored for twelve years. Finally, they released her and she was on a boat to America to re-unite with us...but she was served some bad fish, and she died...on the high seas.
So, I sell the restaurant, uh? I just take it easy. See, if I get excited, 'ats aggravated my condition. The last time I got aggravated, was in the restaurant. With your friend.
Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck...it is more succulent than even I had hoped.
Your friend and I are going to make a lot of money. Of course, I already have a lot of money. Poppie does very well...very well.
Don't fill up on the bread. I'm making you a very special dinner. Very special. (he leaves)
Oh, much better, much better. The doctors say I cannot have no aggravation.
Hello! Jerry, so good to see you again! (Puts his hand out.)
And what gives you the right to do that?
They owe me for those ducks. They were flown in from Newfoundland.
Don't they know I have a gastro-intestinal disorder? If I would have any of this, I would die. Then Poppie's no good to anyone! This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie. How could you be friends with those two?
Use your wrist! It's all in the wrist. (Kramer tosses the dough way up there.) Not too high!
When my mother was abducted by the Communists, she was with child...
Kramer, did I ever tell you about my mother? My mother -
...but the Communists, they put an end to that! So, on this issue there is no debate! And no intelligent person can think differently.
It's a pizza the moment you put your fists in the dough!
