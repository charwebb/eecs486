Wait a second...what is that?
So, I sell the restaurant, uh? I just take it easy. See, if I get excited, 'ats aggravated my condition. The last time I got aggravated, was in the restaurant. With your friend.
They owe me for those ducks. They were flown in from Newfoundland.
Use your wrist! It's all in the wrist. (Kramer tosses the dough way up there.) Not too high!
Don't fill up on the bread. I'm making you a very special dinner. Very special. (he leaves)
That's not a pizza. It'll taste terrible.
Yes, but we cannot give the people the right to choose any topping they want! Now on this issue there can be no debate!
Here it is.
Oh, very good ducks.
It's a pizza the moment you put your fists in the dough!
Your friend and I are going to make a lot of money. Of course, I already have a lot of money. Poppie does very well...very well.
What's the problem?
You! I... I gotta sit down!
Visiting my friend.
When my mother was abducted by the Communists, she was with child...
Welcome (shakes Jerry's hand)
My mother...was taken from my house by the Communists in the middle of the night when I was ten years old. She was sent to a slave labor camp, where she labored for twelve years. Finally, they released her and she was on a boat to America to re-unite with us...but she was served some bad fish, and she died...on the high seas.
Don't they know I have a gastro-intestinal disorder? If I would have any of this, I would die. Then Poppie's no good to anyone! This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie. How could you be friends with those two?
Oh, much better, much better. The doctors say I cannot have no aggravation.
Because it's a pizza!
No, no. You can't put cucumbers on a pizza.
I'm Poppie.
Yes, it is!
That's fine. If you just give me my duck money, I'll be on my way.
What's this? A bottle of wine and a five-alarm chili? They're trying to kill Poppie?!
Kramer, did I ever tell you about my mother? My mother -
Hello! Jerry, so good to see you again! (Puts his hand out.)
Not too much!
(to Jerry) Well?
...but the Communists, they put an end to that! So, on this issue there is no debate! And no intelligent person can think differently.
No.
The what? (Looks at Kramer, and exits.)
It's you! It's you!
She start the big fight, about abortion.
Oh, hello, Jerry.
Hello.
Sweetheart, hello.
And what gives you the right to do that?
