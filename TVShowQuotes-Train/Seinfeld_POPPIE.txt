And what gives you the right to do that?
You're not welcome!
...but the Communists, they put an end to that! So, on this issue there is no debate! And no intelligent person can think differently.
You! I... I gotta sit down!
She start the big fight, about abortion.
What's this? A bottle of wine and a five-alarm chili? They're trying to kill Poppie?!
That's not a pizza. It'll taste terrible.
Yes, it is!
Welcome (shakes Jerry's hand)
I'm Poppie.
They owe me for those ducks. They were flown in from Newfoundland.
Use your wrist! It's all in the wrist. (Kramer tosses the dough way up there.) Not too high!
It's you! It's you!
Visiting my friend.
Wait a second...what is that?
Oh, hello, Jerry.
When my mother was abducted by the Communists, she was with child...
My mother...was taken from my house by the Communists in the middle of the night when I was ten years old. She was sent to a slave labor camp, where she labored for twelve years. Finally, they released her and she was on a boat to America to re-unite with us...but she was served some bad fish, and she died...on the high seas.
Ah, Jerry! Tonight you in for a real treat. I'm personnaly going to prepare the dinner for you and my Audrey.
Don't they know I have a gastro-intestinal disorder? If I would have any of this, I would die. Then Poppie's no good to anyone! This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie. How could you be friends with those two?
Let me show you to your table. (Leads Jerry and Elaine to the table.) Your duck is cooking as we speak. It is so succulent...so succulent!
Yes, but we cannot give the people the right to choose any topping they want! Now on this issue there can be no debate!
Your friend and I are going to make a lot of money. Of course, I already have a lot of money. Poppie does very well...very well.
Sweetheart, hello.
Don't fill up on the bread. I'm making you a very special dinner. Very special. (he leaves)
Because it's a pizza!
The what? (Looks at Kramer, and exits.)
Oh, much better, much better. The doctors say I cannot have no aggravation.
Here it is.
(to Jerry) Well?
No.
Oh, very good ducks.
Hello.
No, no. You can't put cucumbers on a pizza.
Not too much!
So, I sell the restaurant, uh? I just take it easy. See, if I get excited, 'ats aggravated my condition. The last time I got aggravated, was in the restaurant. With your friend.
Hello! Jerry, so good to see you again! (Puts his hand out.)
Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck...it is more succulent than even I had hoped.
