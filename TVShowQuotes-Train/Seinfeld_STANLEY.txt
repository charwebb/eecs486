There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card.
[growly noises, Jim looks terrified]
I am going back to my desk...
Who's a native?
Oh, no, that's ok.  I did learn it on the streets.  On the ghetto, in fact.
I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
[on phone] There are a hundred packs..
No, that was you.
I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson.
Son, you���ve lost your mind. I���m not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.
You brought balloons to a play?
Over the course of this documentary I���ve had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble: my wife did it.
Don't play dumb, you know damn well what we talking about.
No question.
I'm... um, Catholic.
[hits steering wheel angrily] Damn! I told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club.
Put that away and learn.
A little fishy?
Heh heh. [Jim gives camera an odd look]
Is it nice outside?
Who am I supposed to be?
This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me.
I am not changing the way I do my files.
Texas justice.
We're not friends. I didn't think about it.
Hey guys.
Oh, you're gonna face far greater problems than I can possibly help you with.
Dwight.
Did I say 'Messina?' [tires screech]
No.
No, I'm done.
Eh...
I had Mexican food.
Fine. Here it is: you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way.
More meetings and-
Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child!
mm-hmm. [about to leave]
Would ya, would ya step back please
Hurry it up for god's sake. They're gonna be out of banana cream!
It's a bad bet.
The flirtatious tickling.
No.
Amen.
A beautiful family.
Where did you get these facts?
Yes, what is this about?
That's right.
No, you didn���t. Sick of you and your���ooh���
I have a client who watches that movie once a week, at least.
How on earth are we supposed to sell���?
Hello Meredith.
I'm going to go look at the Internet.
Co-manager of what?
I want my money back.
Yeah, I'm sitting on twenty-five hundred in sales I can make at any time but those are my wait till the separation is legal sales.
You said, we could bring our families.
how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal.
[after Ryan opens a new gift - a nameplate saying 'Kelly'] That was meant for Kelly.
Who's Carla Fern?
What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?
Do we have to play?
[growls] I put 17 damn years into this company, and now they���re making me climb Stair Mountain!
If anybody's going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn't a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I'm the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice.
In the African-American community-
When is my birthday?
We just need to hear your plan for our raise.
[kicks ball toward Phyllis] Now it isn't.
When I had my colitis, Toby was very helpful.  He gave me seven weeks off.  When I had my acid reflux, Toby was not as helpful.  So I'm mixed on Toby.
Good news that you found our leads?
Has it really been ten years?
So it's either worth $15 bucks or $65,000.
Ohhh���
Are you out of your damn mind?
She's on her honeymoon. She won't be back for six weeks.
What the hell is going on here?
[Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?
And what did you say?
That's ok.
[holding a crossword puzzle] Yes.
Yeah, but Michael, I'm going to go break it off. That's where I'm headed right now. I swear.
Wait for my outside.  [To Ryan] She is sixteen years old.  What is wrong with you?
Not your staff, Michael. You.
Can I also be a boss?
You can't cancel a holiday.
Don't talk to me.
It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate.
Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea. [groups moves to warehouse and you can hear Erin whispering something]
Dwight, I know these programs. 'Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow.'
Do not care.
When are we getting to sales topics?
Do you want us to look for 'em?
Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?
I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow.
That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.
Life is short. 'Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse.' That's one of my mottoes.
I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands, and give my best to your mother.
Just big.
They said I should talk to you.
Alright, I'll stay! There's a pencil broken in my rolls.
I agree.
They aren't salespeople!
Holiday wishes.
From Argentina.
Oh my God!
That's not what a hate crime is.
So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?
[chuckles]
And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.
That's where nosey'll get you.
Can you promise that?
[as Michael walks away, Stanley whispers angrily to Andy] Gimme those clients!
Ah, Julius, how's it goin'?
No, no, no. You planned this whole thing boy.  I'll snatch your spine out your back.
No.
She's in middle school.
I don���t know, because we���re not friends.
The Kardashians is a good show.
Uh-Uh. No, Dwight. No.
[clears throat, raises his hand] Stanley Hudson. Are there gonna be layoffs?
I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?
I got one queen size bed.
I prefer [looks down at palms] Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona.
My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim's coffee, takes it back out, and leaves]
It's my birthday.
Three hundred and sixty four days, 'till the next Pretzel Day.
What���s that?
I was.
Okay. It's called Who Would You Do?
I need to know...
Excuse me?
Hurry Pam, I need to know how much hellfire is going to rain down on me.
Leave it woman!
Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind.
[looks at the clock, then at his watch] Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o'clock, I will see you all tomorrow:
Who let this boy on the phone?
[humming] What the hell? No. This is NOT happening.
I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.
I'm going to die.
Michael, are you that blind?
Nobody likes that stuff except for you.
[agreement around the office] That's what I was thinking, you kept announcing scores.
I don't care what you call my team.
[at the table] Oh, not again.  Melissa!
How does that qualify him to run a branch?
I don't like cake anymore
Oh, my god. It���s called a garbage can.
Hmm.
I���m on break.
You really like her, huh?
You still had eight weeks more than we did.
Mind? Nothing would delight me more.
Is this an overnight?
Go in there and just ask the man what it means.
Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.
Hey, it���s five o���clock. [everyone leaves and a traffic backup occurs in the parking lot]
Is that supposed to be me?
uh-huh.
Don't tell me how to do my business.
I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die.
No.  In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.
No, no, no, no.
Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories?
Put those away before you hurt yourself.
You ran over an employee.
We sit close.
We get that every year.
It's your job.
Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home?
[flashback] Not maybe. Yes or no.
What.
That���s none of your damn business.
I don't know about anyone else.  But it was a good summer for me.  I lost seven pounds.  And you know what?  I'm just gonna take five days off anyway.
Corn dogs should be the standard.  Corn dogs should be called hot dogs, and hot dogs should be called bad dogs.
It's whatever you want. [offers Jim the bottle]
But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!
Oh, I do.
Please. A little further.
Oh, great.
No [crosses arms], the blue team.
[laughing louder] And he really nailed them on it. Somebody's finally holding them accountable!
Chocolate.
Uh, we don't have any safety mittens
Is he right about that?
They���re like the new Jim and Dwight.
I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.
Still behind.
I know how to plug something in.
That���s Benji. Oh, he���s precious. That���s a healthy-looking baby.
Interesting subject matter. I'm surprised you pulled it off.
I'm out.
So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out?
If we could just double our sales, we already would have.  You���re not making any sense.
Oh my God.
You lucky son of a bitch.
How did you get in my car?
You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?
We sell better?
That is a dangerous precedent.
Fruity and delicious.
Respect it? You're trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson.
[murmurs] Thought it was worth a try.
[throwing ball back] Nope.
Oh, I don't know.
Goodnight.
I did, my wife's name is Terri.
What are we supposed to do?  They keep undercutting us on price.
This is ridiculous.
It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too.
Mmm! [struggles] Ugh!
I would run to Mexico if that's where the sandwiches are.
[enters room] Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our -
I didn't think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did.
[on phone] Hello, honey? I just spoke to the TV repair man, he says we need to keep our TVs turned off for a couple of months. Something about the wiring.
And me.
Yeah, I got a game. It's called 'work hard so my kids can go to college.'
If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him.
I'm outta here.
[laughs, and imitates Donald Trump] You're fired. Get your fingers off my phone.
No you will not.
Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster?
I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!
Why is it so hot in here?
Excuse me?
[chuckling] What a messed up world.
No I didn't.
Is he still doing his boycott?
Oh, good one. [laughs]
Cynthia's been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill... I didn't...
I'm counting on you, Michael.
Hey!
How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure.
All right, I'm done now.
Oh, for the love of God.
You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early.
Huh? What?
Ooh.
Can't you see I'm urinating?
[looks at keys, continues talking on phone] ...the light green or green...
Get the damn phone.
I'm okay with the logic of it.
It could be out of your hands Michael.
[groans] We'll see you tomorrow.
You could feed the hungry. Us.
Oh, sweet mother of God.
Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]
I think I did.
What have we here?
[quietly] Phyllis, what's this guy's name again?
A little bit more and I would have had it.
Okay, I need a drink.
My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised.
Some actress, whether shes hot.
No I'm not.
I'm having trouble getting my work done today.
Not enough lobster. Side order.
Come on people, you know the rules of the game now.
Try mose1234.
So we've got what, another 20 minutes?
[pissed off] You told everyone I was having an affair?
When will that be?
No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week.  For the antioxidants.
I do not think that is funny.
Hi, Michael.
Something wrong, Michael?
Then you won't be able to do inventory.
What?
Good day.
Phil, I'll pretend to be your husband. I'm already sick of you, so it'll seem realistic.
Annoying.
If we act nice now, then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly.
Pigeons.
How did a mosquito get in here?
Or him.
Did you say 'Koi pond'?
Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she...
I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas.
I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones' signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha! [laughing and drinking Brandy]
There's four things that I love. My wife, my daughters, Pam Grier, and a hot, chewy roll of buttered dough.
This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day.
Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars.
I'm not driving with him. [points at Dwight]
What's a seven letter word for purse?
Why not just go one for the year?
Big.
It's collard greens.
Big.
I'm on the phone.
I'm taking the dumplings for my wife.
This is Pretzel Day.
[angry] Yeah wow!
Liquid.
I'm not disabled and neither are you.
You're always asking for our attention.
Money.
This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.
I would like to stay. This pertains to me.
I do not know.
I didn't hear a phone.
Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa.
I'm going to the party in the break room, because they have more chairs in there. If I have to stand around a long time, I get real unpleasant to be around.
He can top that.'
What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt.
I will NOT. [throws ball back]
[flashback] Are you from another planet?
Trust me. It only gets worse.
[refills his coffee near a sign that reads 'Honor System: $0.50' with a camera pointed at it]
Michael.
Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava.
[in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning.
Keep talking all you want.
It's all about my bonus.
Need a hand?
[beams] This is - nice! [pats Oscar's shoulder] All of us back together.
Pass.
Let me get back to my desk right now.
We know exactly what holiday you're referring to.
We'll never have to buy meatballs again.
[cheerily] Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine.
It's just that... Teri's been traveling a lot...
Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now.
Learn why Daddy's so cranky when he comes home from work.
Money.
[backing out of the bloodmobile] I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just [to Phyllis] Band-Aids.
It's collard greens.
Oh, I forgot something in my car. I'll see you guys up there. [takes the stairs after the elevator doors close]
Unbelievable.
[insincerely] Good to be back.
This is an abomination.
Nope. Starts with an H.
Is that from the machine that was in your office?
This is not the meal I was promised. I'm going to have no energy for the rest of the day.
Shuckin��� your peas.
We all think you don't have a surprise.
I don't know.
No.
I think I do.
Deangelo, you're going to starve to death. [laughter]
I'm sorry, Phyllis.  No, I don't think they'll get the account.
I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job.
So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it?
If you don't smell this, you're fired.'
Somebody's always got to be a hero.
Why should we help you?
And it's been lonely.
EAT IT! [Jim begins eating black licorice]
[falls to the floor with a loud thud]
It's just that we need to know.
That little girl is a child! I don't want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?!
Helllloooo!
You have just spit on my face.
Got an hour? I'll try to explain.
[shows newspaper article and reads] 'Local businessman pledges college tuition to third graders'
You find anything?
We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael!
To the.
A toaster, you?
Ugh. I don���t want to sit through a whole concert of that.
Get us out of this!
I don't care.
[pulls out Brandy bottle] Well���I was saving this for my retirement, which I guess is today.
Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home? [Michael hands up]
[sighs]
I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please.
That's one book. You've got two others.
Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier.
What?
About time.
Eee.
Don���t be pushy Jim. It���s tacky.
Hmm, come here much?
It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.
No one is ready for this. You can���t be ready for this. We don���t even know what this is.
I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing you've ever done up in this office.
Get off me!
About what?
Oh, sure, we talk all the time.
This doomsday device sounds like a scare tactic to me. Y2K all over again.
Shh!
It's a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.
Are you trying to kill me?
Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.
Ooh-hoo, look at that baby���
Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some M.L.K. Dream for Equality. I want to own a decommissioned Lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space.
Phyllis got flashed in the parking lot.
Super.
So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?
Are you crazy?
Yes...
[drinks a 5-Hour Energy shot and groans]
I get it. [To Phyllis] You need to see more?
It wasn't me.
That's it. I'm going to go watch the boats on the river.
...cases of typical format and coated white paper. Okay, thanks again so much. All right, bye-bye.
Michael, don't listen to them.
My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.
[on the phone] When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott.
What does that mean?
Heh, heh, heh.
We all saw you do it.
Well I'm not getting paid to work in a microwave oven.
Yep, looks that way.
American Diabetes Association.
I like what we have.
Is that it?
[on phone] I am upset.  Don't I sound upset?
[flashback] Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it.
[laughs] You don't have to lie. Through here.
Boooooo. Booooo. Back of the line.
[to Phyllis] Oh okay. Good night. [climbs in to Dwight's car] What's the haul?
Yeah, We're not doing that. I have kids in college. Make a decision.
I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise.  How on Earth did Michael call my bluff?  Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things.
I didn't say that.
Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod.
I wouldn't have come, but I know Jan is showing up soon. I don't wanna miss the show.
Boy, I will hammer spank your rear.
[in pain] Oh. Go away.
I'm going back inside.
Well, well, last year, I got great work, so I don't...
How did I end up back in Crazytown?
I will gladly give you that information when my bonus comes through.
Go on, kid. You know you don't belong here.
I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for... that is the life.
You don't have our attention.
Michael?  A word?
Oscar!
Marry me Holly.
Hmmm. [glances at Andy] Thank you.
How ���bout you want us to work harder, pay us more.
Yes, please let us know.
I'm back.
I know, I just read it on the sign.
Yeah, who's a little girl now? [everyone laughs]
You said bring a toothbrush.
You two better watch yourselves.
You want us to apologize to you?
There he is!
I'm not sitting in a wheelchair.
She does. But neither of them know about Lydia.
Look for your stapler!
Amen.  Just keep the ribs coming.
Hold it!
What kind of food?
No. Um-um.
Just transfer the damn call.
You must have been scared out of your mind.
Yup.
Can we expect any payroll interruptions?
Why don't you mind your business?
No.
But the doctor said if I can't find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings I'm going to die.
What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we're talking about the same thing here.
Money.
I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it.
I am not going to apologize to you.
Zero.
Why can't you just do regular sit-ups?
What's he measuring?
Why don't we eat more corn dogs?  They're delicious.
I think it's because of my sales record.
Stanley Hudson.
[laughing] I did enjoy grinding your beans, son.
Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday?
Goooood bye.
I mean I'm learning nothing.
He ain���t coming.
Michael, can't your conversation wait till Monday.
[walks into the office grunting and wheezing] You own the building. Why can���t you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
Make it 100.
Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha���
I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I���m telling someone how to do somethin���. I go on with a long description and then I say, ���and shove it up your butt.��� It���s stupid, but it���s my thing now.
If ghosts are real, how come everyone knows what they look like? It's not like a bunch of people got together and agreed on a lie.
How did Ryan use it? As an object?
Okay, um...
Excuse me?
It's my bio-feedback machine..
What are you doing?
We do not wanna hear about this.
I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan?
Atlanta.
Last year, five years ago...
Oh, I was all about the Y2K bug. Paid some guy to update my PC, threw out my microwave, canceled my plane ticket, sold all my stocks, spent New Year's Eve with a gas mask on my face. I was even wearing a diaper! Someone said Y2K would get the toilets.
No way.
How about make-believe land has anything you want?
So, I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin. [starts chuckling]
Fine.
I don't want no Kwanza wreath, I don't need a dreidel in my face, that's it's own thing. And who's that black Santa for?! I don't care! I know Santa ain't black! I could care less. I want Christmas! Just give me plain baby Jesus, lying in a manger, Christmas!
I usually don't enjoy the theater, but this is delightful.
Are you serious?
Mmhmm. What?
So I'm not fired.
[flashback] I'm done. Goodbye.
There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible.
You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.
That's what she said. [Stanley and Michael both laugh]
Yes, I���m living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds.
Can't say.
We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree?
But... why Dwight?
Where's the rest of it, it's got no balls.
Mmmm... chewy.
That's right. [laughs]
Do I need my jacket?
Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.
Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.
I don't know. [They shrug and leave.]
I've never heard that song before. And once I heard it, I did not care for it, but that song means it's time to go home. Now���it's my favorite song.
Night, everybody.
I'm listening.
Oh, my ankle!
Why would this affect our bonuses?
Oh, actually no I don't Michael.
[to Jim] Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight.
They are not.
It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt.
Yeah.
I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years.
Oh my God!
[eating soft pretzel] We've all changed.
Oh, is today Recyclops Day?
Leave me alone, dammit.
I brought my daughter Melissa in. That girl is very spoiled. That child has no idea what I have to deal with so she can have her little cell phone and spend all my money at that Steamtown Mall.
So?
Why'd you do this?
She's right, Andy. you're being a jabroni
I love Philly. Dirty town.
She's upstairs talking to Charles.
Excuse me.
[gives Phyllis a look]
How many times do you need to take a stroll?
Thank you, Michael.
I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.
You've been meatballed! [laughs]
What is?
It's fine.
Oh, hello. [laughs with Cathy]
What?!
Oh, Michael, I'm glad you're here.
Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie?  I gave blood earlier and I'm still feeling woozy.
I should put you in touch with him. Maybe we could get together and work on that account.
I would die.
The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
I don't want to stay until seven again this year.
DID I STUTTER?
Let's just make this kid open this damn car.
I'm not feeling well.  I need to sit down.
These are all the same?
Great.
What are you talking about?
Or do you only drink with your kids?
I thought you were killed by Polluticorn.
Should've put him out of his misery and just fired her.
If you do that, you're going to have to put out.
We deserve to know.
How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus.
Fantastic.
[as Michael gets in car] That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?
Why do you always assume I have diabetes?
I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house.
Ugh. I'm not eating mystery meat.
Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow?
Not again...
It���s all gone. I didn���t get a chance to try them all because Creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant.
No.
Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you don't have a gun.
Oh, yes.  Let's listen to it again.  And this time, really listen to the pauses.
No one paid me to say 'Booyah.'  Now pick up the ball.
I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that.
Hmmm...
I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?
Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.
[laughs heartily and passes a newspaper to Phyllis]
Me too. [holds up four fingers]
Why are you calling me here at home?
Fantastic.
I...
I don't want it.
Are you giving us our clients back?
That���s pizza.
It's true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people...
No. Are those purchase orders signed?
Mailboxes, Etc.
Ha ha ha! And you just said, 'Hi! Hi! Hi!' Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old!
I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them.
Hmm?
In the box.
I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here's what I used to look like. [holds up old photo] Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted.
Where's my five dollars?
Uh huh.
Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time.  We ran out last year, remember?
I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn���t work then. And now look what he���s doing to us.
Hmm?
[through the fence to Terri, who's holding a drink for him to sip] Ah, we don't know.  They didn't give him his Christmas bonus this year, so...
[standing at the supply shelf] I'm on the phone.
So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard.
You want the lead?
Why can't you guys do it?
I do not like pregnant women in my workspace.  They're always complaining.  I have varicose veins, too.  I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry - do you think my nipples don't get sore too?  Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital?
Mm, how many bedrooms?
And I think, 'there's no possible way--
I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot.
Fair enough.
I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.
I lost four pounds. I don't know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds.
No.
Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs?
[walking down the runway] Raaah! [waves sword]
I know what you can do Jim. Take those black licorice, then go get some of those red licorice, take 'em in your hand, roll 'em up real tight...
My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail? [Jim slowly slinks down in his seat, with the 'Jim Face']. Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no?
You said we were getting bonuses.
I'll get over it.
Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs.
Andy���s from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?
Thank you. [reaches for bagel]
There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon.
Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Hudson.
This is ridiculous. [gets up to leave, as does Angela]
The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.
I'm in. [sits back down]
Did you tell him how sick of him you were?
Thank you so much.  [Stanley sits down and pulls out his crossword puzzle]
Show some pride. This is crap.
Now we���re talkin���.
I always knew my co-workers were annoying. I never realized I could profit from it. Go ahead Bob Vance, call Phyllis, all day.
Yes. I had a heart attack.  I would quit, but I'm too old to find another job and I don't have enough saved to retire.  I feel like I'm working in my own casket.
Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you're both dead.
What's that supposed to mean?
I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.
Is that it?
Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add ���em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT!
Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until six twice to cover for you. My wife got to the TV first, had to sit through damn Rizzoli and damn Isles.
Mmhmm, happy birthday.
[storms out of Michael's office] Well, we're not going to Florida.
Oh, no, I���m not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up.
This meeting.
Is it white wine?
In January?
Sounds like a hoot. I'm in.
And we are grateful.
Ninety nine cases..yeah.
[flashback] No way. Uh-uh.
[to Phyllis] Had to be part of the group. [laughs]
Not me.
What's happening?
Booyah! [laughs]
My mini bar is oddly out of rum.
Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.
[on the phone] No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?
Four Splenda. Are you crazy?
We get to go home?
I knew it. Haha! [they high five]
I missed you too.
Not a gun.
Are you just gonna sit there, Office Administrator, or are you going to do something?
[On the phone] You���ve got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!
Oh, thanks.
Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!
Hmmmpt.
There is a butterfly on this. Why?
I���ll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster.
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.
This is not natural.
Fine. How are you?
Okay, you need to stop that right now.
Next stop pies! [group joins in]
If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. 'Papyr.' Paper for women. It's pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister.
Way to go, Ryan!
I admire your culture's success in America.
Aw, let him do it.
That doesn't make you a boss.
What's under the cloth?
I'm the same way with horny people.
[whispers] Click the 'x'
That's it. I'm getting my stuff. I'm leaving for the day.
Are those purchase orders signed?
Can���t you just leave?
Are you ready for some meatball?
I will not work in a roach billboard.
... I'll take the kid.
Goodbye. [walks away]
He was good.
I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this.
I'm taking my dumplings.
Seems recent.
[Pats Nellie on the shoulder as he's walking by her] See you next Christmas.
