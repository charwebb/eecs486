I know what it smells like but I didn't roll in anything. It's from listening to all of Gabe's bull[bleep]. [laughter] 'Isn't this the perfect romantic getaway, Erin? Sitting on a deserted island wearing dog costumes? I'm Gabe and I'm a weirdo.'
Wait, wait, you think she invented 'Talla-nasty?' [chuckles] no, no, no, no���
So these are your cheeses, your ham, your sausages, your herbs, and your vegetables. Here's what's been done, so start creating. Some times it helps to think of a part of the world, and...
More tasteless than this...'is that a palm tree or did Gabe get skinnier? Either way, let's pee on it.'  [laughter]
[to Toby] I hear them kissing all the time. It's this horrible plipping sound. You know, it's like Chinese water torture. Just...[makes popping sound] like it's coming from my own head.
[to Andy] I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400,000. [smiles] We've investigated. Every time it's been user error.  They block the vents or something, I don't know. That's why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I'd like to reward you for that. [pulls out gift card] That's god for five bucks at Dunkin' Donuts. Any Dunkin' Donuts. [Andy looks over at Darryl and Darryl motions for Andy to go to him]
Can I buy everyone coffees? [everyone shakes their heads] [in Cookie Monster voice] 'Or cookies.'
Oh my God, I can't look at roaches.
Great! [to Jim and Toby] Um, can we just... [does a 'wrap it up' motion with his pen]
No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it's reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. One: You're taking MDMA. Street name, ecstasy. I've done it, and I know the feeling.
I'm not sure the temporary replacement of an H.R. rep really warrants a party.
Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women's room.
Ok, but once this starts, it's going to be moving fast. It's going to be hot and heavy and I don't want a bunch of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around my jock. You know?
Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we're still dating?
Most of our business comes from selling printers. So don't think of yourselves as paper salesmen anymore, but as printer salesmen who also sell paper.
Okay. We're going to table the hat question. The best ideas are going to come to me, I make the final decision, period.
The cinema of the unsettling is a growing film movement.  The most well known film in the genre is an hour long shot of a squirrel with diarrhea.
Abe and Mary are seated watching the show. [in Lincoln voice] Oh Mary this is wonderful��� Ok Mary stop your scolding.  I���ll be quiet. [aside to the audience] I need her like I need a hole in the head! [scattered chuckles from the crowd] [Gabe raises his hand with a finger pointed in the shape of a gun to his head] BANG!  Ooh [Gabe falls to the ground and the crowd claps, Gabe picks up the Lincoln hat, bows, runs to the crowd and trades it back for his pink ���DM does GB��� hat and runs off]
[laughs, eventually Erin joins him laughing] Oh that would be scary!
This is just, uh- This American Life, I think I heard it on.
[walking with Jim and Pam] Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life.
I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out. You said, and I quote, 'My good sir! Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand.' I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way.
Yeah we had a whole conversation about Mondays���
Too late! Oh. Ha. An IM chat. Very clever. I'll just print that out. Come on guys. Grow up. I don't want to be your babysitter.
CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes.
Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets.
Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN! [slams fist, hurting his hand]
Uh, excuse me, excuse me. How does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming?
Well... it's an interview, and we don't know that you really have the plan.
Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for.
That's very nice. [referring to Kelly's bindi] I never noticed that before.
You know what? Let me see what I can do.
I cannot believe that Andy is throwing a party like this just to impress the CEO. Classic Gabe move. Hey Andy, how about you don't steal my business strategies, and I won't dress like my life is just one long brunch?
You must be pretty horny. [Erin shakes head no]
No! You go away! [storms out, toilet flushes, Jim exits the bathroom]
Gabe's mom... hmm... Gabe's mom? Wait. Tall woman? Looks like Gabe? Yeah, I banged her.'
Well, uh... why don't you just tell me a little about yourself, Hide.
[walking back into the office] That was ugly. I'm sorry you had to see that.
So I got us a compromise. This movie's called 'Hardware'. It tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like Wall-e, that the government invented to destroy humans. It's some of what you like and some of what I like, and... married...
And trustworthy in all your business activities and relationships. Treat one another-
Really? All kinds? So you like songs of hate written by the white knights of the Ku Klux Klan?
It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened.
What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. And... you did it. [nods at Andy]
There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right?
Very unprofessional, 'Jacques.' Or, should I say, Dwight.
Ok, I'm sorry but I am going to have to shut this down.
We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that.
Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat.
But you do. You are in charge -
Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I���m pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines.
It's for protecting my ass. When you suckers lift more than you can handle. Sup, I'm Gabe. Corporate. Continue. Don't be nervous.
Um. I set my stuff up in there. So...  just give me a few minutes to clean that out for you.
Erin, I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God. [Erin and Angela both look taken aback]
Well Darryl, considering that I basically own the place, I'm just chillin' at mi casa. This is me, in repose..I suppose.
My gym allows it. I wish they didn't, but it's policy. So I respect it, and I just--[put's his hands cupped by his face and turns away] keep a low--you know, I look away. Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room.
And that's straight from corporate. So not to be scary, but yeah, I would listen to me. And that's all. Ciao.
[on voicemail] You've reached Gabe Lewis, I'm currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao. [beep]
The Michelin man called, he wants his cummerbund back.
Whoa! That's a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.
Yeah. He told me you two broke up.
I don't know. All I know is the building.
Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. Kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor. [clapping] All right.
Oh, this is 'Print in All Colors,' Sabre's minority executive training program.
Why do you keep repeating - [Michael hangs up]
I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen.
I've read- and I don't know anything about this personally- but they say prostate stimulation can help.
That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves.
How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability. [makes a 'zero' hand gesture]
[lowers volum] Some of us are trying to have a conversation.
Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit is to call this a stress-induced outburst.  You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling.
I still wear Erin's button-downs around the condo sometimes. So it feels to me like we're still in a relationship-
Corporate says to me, ���Gabe, we need you in Scranton.��� Scranton says, ���Gabe, go back down to Florida. You're needed there.��� So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm up there. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I'm down here. I can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying.
And I overheard, and thought, hey, that'd be fun, don't mind if I do.
I'm sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on. [Jim and Pam struggling to stay awake] Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way?
The Sabre Code of Conduct outlines the governing principles key to establishing and maintaining trust with our employees, clients-
Uh, I think you���re gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. [chuckles] It���ll be upsetting if you don���t.
Okay. That's great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else.
Oh, thank God. I had a horrible nightmare that I was stuck in America with Gabe.'
The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don't respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I'm the I.T. guy. This Cookie Monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I'm an authority figure.
Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology.
Okay, why don't we simplify this? Darryl brings it to Michael, Michael brings it to me, no one calls Jo.
[following Jim and Pam to their car] Guys, to err is human. [trying to block their car]
I would also like to toast Robert California. Mr. California,...
[as Michael and Jo leave] Are you leaving? Oh, am I... should I continue with the investigation?
[dressed as Lady Gaga] In case you can't read m-m-my Poker Face... [laughs] we will be reviewing our sales policies. [accepts note from Michael, reads it out loud] I have ten seconds to read them or this whole place blows up.
Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important. [Pam hands Jim a note] It's not about showing you're in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It's about forgiveness. And yes, I'm talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension.
Erin, I've been to Japan. I know how to use chopsticks so well. Come back. One night.
Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard. [Erin looks shocked] Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what - what God is. But for all of the disbelief [phone rings] I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum [phone continues ringing] out... there... uh, do we not have voicemail?
Umm... 'You don't have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, I'm the only one here.' Ha.
Oh, I don't get that sense at all from you, so...
Okay, you know what, you don't need to make that sound.
No, not nice. Terrible. Doesn't even include the fact that they're dogs.
Fun fact. In France, they call Limitless 'The Man with Many Capabilities.'
Over here is Meredith Palmer and Creed Bratton.
[holding ball in open palm] Oh, yeah, totally.  Jim, you got ripped off big time.
Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It's come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or e-mail this around.
[Andy walks by with DeAngelo, says quietly after he leaves] Walk away bitch.
Actually, that's Nick. He's your new IT guy. Uh, he's setting up a site blocker. Mostly blocking the inappropriate sites.  And then there are the time-wasting sites like Twitter, YouTube. We are blocking those as well.
How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR?
And that goes double for me. I'll stay even later than you'd like.
No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying.
I technically cannot. I don't have the lung capacity to blow a whistle.
Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the shortlist for next time there's an opening.
So, tonight I was thinking, I'm gonna go to the cemetery. I'm gonna drink a little wine and I thought maybe you'd like to come with me.
Can you two please join me in my office? Now.
They're going to be pretty pleased in Tallahassee that I snagged an Indian for the program. She'll be the first. The program's mostly black. It's almost too black. That didn't sound right.
That is Jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office.
No. I don't like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?
Well, you have a job to do. Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales.
You're really going to like Bill. He, uh, he has me toilet a lot of people for him. [Dwight sighs, Gabe's phone rings] Hallway phone, Gabe Lewis speaking.
First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you'd expect to hear from corporate. Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances.
Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a fire, so your appointment got-
Toby I'm going to tell you her last name tomorrow because she's going to be screaming it tonight.
To Robert California, from the moment you entered our building and our hearts, you...
I am as smooth as a porpoise. {Erin argues]
- of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, Michael.
[stands up and walks to stage, takes the microphone] Well, this is embarrassing, um, I'm obviously really angry at Erin. It's that quarter life crisis everyone's been talking about. [Jim is looking wide eyed, jaw dropped] Alright I'm gonna go. [Dwight plays cricket noises]
Number two: You're desperately trying to fit in a whole relationship before Toby comes back from jury duty and Holly has to go back to Nashua. Or three: You're at an age where your sexual climaxes aren't as powerful so you need to overcompensate with foreplay, taboo behavior.
That'd be hilarious. Uh, 'Jo, they're creating a hostile work environment. Stop  'em.'
No, I'm gonna stand where I want. Okay? You don't wanna get on my bad side! I've seen some horrible things! I own over two hundred horror movies!
We just want to say how grateful we are.
That is not how it seems to me.
Yeah it seems like there isn���t a narrative. [on screen a man gets into a car]  Maybe the filmmaker realized that even narrative is comforting.
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. It's either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed.
Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels?
Ok. Ok there. I heard that. So I'm sorry, Pam, but that's it. I'm going to have to suspend you without pay for two days.
Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood. [laughs] Not every day.
Statements of such nature, while they have their place, are overused in a competitive business environment.
I get the sense that Val enjoys a good putdown. Considering that's the only thing I know about her. I will be milking that hard. [Gestures milking a cow]
Ok final thing, and this is a fun one: Instead of writing the caption directly under the picture, let's all try using Sticky Quips. All right? New, from Dunder Mifflin Sabre.
You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate. A two-week training program at the Yale school of management, obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities.
What do you want me to say? I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. [to Jim and Toby] Are we all just gonna pretend to-- okay. [to Kelly] Um, what are your weaknesses?
I've got just the thing! [leaves, comes back with a synthesizer] This one's called Earth Rise, on the Moon. [music plays]
You marked severe in all the categories, including at risk for homicidal behavior.
We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so... [nods]
Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview.
Ok, did everyone get one? With these bottles, we eliminate the need for plastic water bottles, which are the scourge of the environment.
I dominate Valentine's Day. I practically make romance into a science.
[as Lincoln] I just don't understand. It's 1865, victory is ours, I've saved the very soul of our nation, and yet... happiness eludes me. Oh, perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits.
Seeing as it's Valentine's Day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace.
[on the phone] You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right. [hangs up]
Michael, you just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private?
Oh, Jo. Jo, I'm disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was...
Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics.
[makes buzzer sound] Too slow. It's the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential.
Ok, well, I bet you can fit 20 little cups of water in your aluminum bottle.
Erin and I make great use of ours.
This is Michael Scott, co-regional manager of this branch.
Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.
You know, times were tough. I was unemployed, I was still heart-broken over you, I've lost a good fifty pounds. But as you can see I put all that weight right back on. Feel how fat my buttocks are. Yeah, it's crazy. Touch it. It's like a warm pumpkin.
I'll let this slide, but I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you.
How would we know that, if you don't...
Those overnight packages needed to go out, and Michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable.
Yeah. I don't want to be offensive but, uh... may I ask you what that means?
Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities.
I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue.
Hey Darryl, I was thinking, uh, maybe while we read through this, uh, you could grab us all some coffee. My treat. It's a hundred dollar bill. Should cover it I think. Don't bring me any of that caramel soy latte crap, ok? I want a decaf frappuccino. Val���
[bell dings] Guys, that's the elevator. What if it's him?
Will do... Can I get one of those name plates... that says Gabe Lewis?
Um, actually, if you don't mind, I would love to put this on the Sabre website. [correctly pronounced 'say-ber']
Well, it's nine miles away. I'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf.
Well, that's actually what I came to talk to you about. I know how much you want to watch 'Wall-e'.
We have a policy here at Sabre where we are, uh, allowed to take two weeks.
I'm not technically seeing her, but uh I've seen her, with the eyes and uh there was attraction. In at least one direction. So..[holds up fist]
My entire childhood, I was the one left out, and I said to myself: Gabe, if you just achieve some success, you'll be part of them. You'll be part of the happy ones. But instead, people just used my success as a new way to shut me out.
Oh boy. Can you get every department head's signature on this so I can back this up to corporate?
Well, that's gonna be tough, because we're getting a dunking clinic from Magic Jordan himself.
Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again?
I love maternity wards. It's the perfect blend of love and horror. Things can go so wrong or so right.
I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he's a rat, and I think he's responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,... he broke up the happiest couple in this office!
Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush! [Gabe makes a flushing motion, Dwight twists Gabe's arm] Ow!
Michael, I don't want to incentivise murder. But - we've tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff -
So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation?
Yeah. But not just bagels. All unwanted problems. Question: What's the most important appliance in your house?
Um, hi, uh, my name is Gabe Lewis. I am coordinating director for merging regions.
They say that if you can strengthen your core, it improves your sexual performance. So, you will find me on the Ab-Blaster. And then you will find me blasting...uh, a very nice young woman.
They don't touch. They don't kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife.
I picked out our movie. It's called 'Suspiria'. It pushes all the boundaries. All your preconceived notions about what horror can be come crashing down.
When our warehouse workers make deliveries, they're going to be encouraged to offer clients extra products. And then they will split those commissions with sales.
How many windows are there in New York City?
Steve Martin. [laughs, then falls] uh, I'm fine. [grunts]
Droswip, yeah.  I get it.  Okay, we're gonna get you to the restroom.
When you're dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like. I wish my gym didn't allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. 'Cause it's policy. See what I mean?
Well, Toby's in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby's done a fine job.
Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk.
[sounding hurt] I'm either going to quit today, or stay to make sure that Andy's career is destroyed.
Just do it. You were the it that I was just doing.
Uh uh. Corporate stole nothing, okay? Darryl told me, and then I told them, giving Darryl full credit, so... no need to [mimicking Andy] screw corporate! Or anything like that, so. Let's give Darryl a round of applause, as planned. [claps]
I'm gonna head back to Siberia there. Ciao. [he and Erin kiss]
I don't wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad.
I love the burn. The burn is where I live.
Why don't we say ciao to the impressions? [everyone says ciao]
Whom I'm seeing is Val from down in the warehouse.
Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn't this where you fell in love?
Hey. I need you to get the paperwork rolling on a new workplace relationship.
Well he���s probably a drug dealer. That���s the best way to land a hot girlfriend. You just uh get her hooked on blow.
Wake up, Fred. The power cord on your Sabre printer shocked you into a coma, and you're dreaming you're a dog on a desert island.'
And, uh, you will do your counseling right here, because our HR staff are all certified counselors.
The problem, unfortunately, is about the office administrator. I have gone through everything for the past three years. There is nothing that says you are the office administrator.
It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some 'Slumdog Millionaire' scenario, where every word she's playing has a connection to her orphan past. It's possible.
Okay. So, PDAs. That's gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh...
Ok, um, I told the story of your uncle, and I have a feeling that you would have [Michael gesturing behind computer] really been proud of the way... Okay, um...
I will make this sexier than you could ever imagine.
No. [Robert then nods his head at Jim]
[sees Andy walk into the Men's Room and follows him in] Stay away from Erin! [cornering him in the bathroom]
I don't know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah.
Okay, while this is interesting we should get back to work. These stand-offs can last a long time. What if it's another Waco.
Well, I wish that I could do something, but it's kind of policy, you know? Above my pay grade. You know?
Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV?
Oh, well I'm still the corporate liaison to the branch.
[on phone] Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out.
Pam, I don't want to accuse you of anything. I just want everything to be back the way it's supposed to be. Can you just admit... admit...
I can see you in the jungle now.
Oh, is it okay with you? Because if it's not, you work for me, so... Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and contracts governing our business. Be honest, fair-
I get it. Andy's slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam.
Ohh. Dropping bombs, right? [explosion noise] This really make you think, Michael?
Yup. We could watch some right now if you want. I got a Korean film on my iPod if you want to just- if you have the cables.
Oh? Uh... we haven't started the interview yet. Were you--were you joking?
Core���s critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One ��� lengthen. Two ��� elongate.
Yeah, that would be awesome. I could get a girlfriend. Wouldn't have to go to Amsterdam seven times a year. But uh, I'm young, right?  I will date when I'm dead! [Laughs]
Oh, come on. My rules could not possibly have been that oppressive.
I'm back! Ha ha. Pam, perfect. I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem.
Apparently, I bear a passing resemblance to Abraham Lincoln. Makes it kind of hard for me to go to places like museums, historical monuments, elementary schools... I don't see it.
Chelsea's Mom: Chelsea, give Mr. Lincoln your hat so I can take a picture.
Okay, I-I am, I'm almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. [Robert and Gabe chuckle at this, then Gabe stops chuckling] Do you, um, do you think that you are?
Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe.
Just read the letter under your windshield wiper, it explains everything. Quick one. [leans in for a kiss]
Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?
I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They���d flex them all night at the discotheque.
Darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He's gone.
Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim. [Dwight starts to clap] Ok fine. You too Dwight.
[talking on the phone] So I can reprimand them but I can't suspend them. Oh I can't do either. Uh huh. Fair enough.
Oh, he is. He's the co-manager, and that's the other co-manager.
You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the gang.
I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.
What kind of music are you into, Peter?
First thing's first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would've just looped back to me, so, it's cool you recognized my role here.
I started dating Erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite.
Sure. Basically, there's no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem.
Thank you all for meeting on such sort notice.
Little cups? Like paper or plastic or... ?
[on videochat]  First let me say that I told them everything you wanted me to say, in just the way you wanted me to say it, so...
Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy.
Corporate wants me up here, Dunder Mifflin wants me down there. What they worked out is that Monday, Wednesday and Friday I'm here in Scranton, Tuesday Thursday I'm in Tallahassee, I mean I feel like Vera Farmiga in Up in the Air, you know? More money more problems. Although, I didn't get a raise, so you know. Same money, more problems.
They don't make these cords in boot cut anymore!
Oh, close. It's a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck.
