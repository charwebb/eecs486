Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard. [Erin looks shocked] Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what - what God is. But for all of the disbelief [phone rings] I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum [phone continues ringing] out... there... uh, do we not have voicemail?
We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that.
What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. And... you did it. [nods at Andy]
Ok, but once this starts, it's going to be moving fast. It's going to be hot and heavy and I don't want a bunch of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around my jock. You know?
Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.
Why do you keep repeating - [Michael hangs up]
[to Andy] I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400,000. [smiles] We've investigated. Every time it's been user error.  They block the vents or something, I don't know. That's why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I'd like to reward you for that. [pulls out gift card] That's god for five bucks at Dunkin' Donuts. Any Dunkin' Donuts. [Andy looks over at Darryl and Darryl motions for Andy to go to him]
And that's straight from corporate. So not to be scary, but yeah, I would listen to me. And that's all. Ciao.
Well, you have a job to do. Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales.
Yeah it seems like there isn���t a narrative. [on screen a man gets into a car]  Maybe the filmmaker realized that even narrative is comforting.
Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat.
Well, I wish that I could do something, but it's kind of policy, you know? Above my pay grade. You know?
You marked severe in all the categories, including at risk for homicidal behavior.
...I'm sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations.
My entire childhood, I was the one left out, and I said to myself: Gabe, if you just achieve some success, you'll be part of them. You'll be part of the happy ones. But instead, people just used my success as a new way to shut me out.
[talking on the phone] So I can reprimand them but I can't suspend them. Oh I can't do either. Uh huh. Fair enough.
[laughs] Oh no no no no no no. She wouldn't even let me say it. It was adorable. She would plug her ears and scream her heat out.
More tasteless than this...'is that a palm tree or did Gabe get skinnier? Either way, let's pee on it.'  [laughter]
I'm not sure the temporary replacement of an H.R. rep really warrants a party.
When you're dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like. I wish my gym didn't allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. 'Cause it's policy. See what I mean?
They don't touch. They don't kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife.
They don't make these cords in boot cut anymore!
Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit is to call this a stress-induced outburst.  You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling.
Oh, I don't get that sense at all from you, so...
First thing's first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would've just looped back to me, so, it's cool you recognized my role here.
Oh, come on. My rules could not possibly have been that oppressive.
But you do. You are in charge -
Oh, close. It's a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck.
I cannot believe that Andy is throwing a party like this just to impress the CEO. Classic Gabe move. Hey Andy, how about you don't steal my business strategies, and I won't dress like my life is just one long brunch?
I can see you in the jungle now.
Erin, I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God. [Erin and Angela both look taken aback]
Okay. That's great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else.
[stands up and walks to stage, takes the microphone] Well, this is embarrassing, um, I'm obviously really angry at Erin. It's that quarter life crisis everyone's been talking about. [Jim is looking wide eyed, jaw dropped] Alright I'm gonna go. [Dwight plays cricket noises]
I love the burn. The burn is where I live.
Okay, well, obviously if it's a really, really good idea, my door is open.
Erin, I've been to Japan. I know how to use chopsticks so well. Come back. One night.
Ok final thing, and this is a fun one: Instead of writing the caption directly under the picture, let's all try using Sticky Quips. All right? New, from Dunder Mifflin Sabre.
No, not nice. Terrible. Doesn't even include the fact that they're dogs.
[dressed as Lady Gaga] In case you can't read m-m-my Poker Face... [laughs] we will be reviewing our sales policies. [accepts note from Michael, reads it out loud] I have ten seconds to read them or this whole place blows up.
[on videochat]  First let me say that I told them everything you wanted me to say, in just the way you wanted me to say it, so...
Hey Darryl, I was thinking, uh, maybe while we read through this, uh, you could grab us all some coffee. My treat. It's a hundred dollar bill. Should cover it I think. Don't bring me any of that caramel soy latte crap, ok? I want a decaf frappuccino. Val���
Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim. [Dwight starts to clap] Ok fine. You too Dwight.
[on the phone] You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right. [hangs up]
Okay, you know what, you don't need to make that sound.
Over here is Meredith Palmer and Creed Bratton.
That's very nice. [referring to Kelly's bindi] I never noticed that before.
Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for.
How would we know that, if you don't...
It's awful. [reaches for tissue box, hands it to Kevin]
My gym allows it. I wish they didn't, but it's policy. So I respect it, and I just--[put's his hands cupped by his face and turns away] keep a low--you know, I look away. Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room.
Darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He's gone.
Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV?
Michael! You are making this harder than it has to be.
I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue.
Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview.
Well, it's nine miles away. I'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf.
Wait, wait, you think she invented 'Talla-nasty?' [chuckles] no, no, no, no���
Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN! [slams fist, hurting his hand]
Oh? Uh... we haven't started the interview yet. Were you--were you joking?
Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels?
The Sabre Code of Conduct outlines the governing principles key to establishing and maintaining trust with our employees, clients-
Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk.
Just read the letter under your windshield wiper, it explains everything. Quick one. [leans in for a kiss]
I love maternity wards. It's the perfect blend of love and horror. Things can go so wrong or so right.
I will make this sexier than you could ever imagine.
It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some 'Slumdog Millionaire' scenario, where every word she's playing has a connection to her orphan past. It's possible.
Fun fact. In France, they call Limitless 'The Man with Many Capabilities.'
They're going to be pretty pleased in Tallahassee that I snagged an Indian for the program. She'll be the first. The program's mostly black. It's almost too black. That didn't sound right.
Well, that's gonna be tough, because we're getting a dunking clinic from Magic Jordan himself.
[as Michael and Jo leave] Are you leaving? Oh, am I... should I continue with the investigation?
I'm gonna head back to Siberia there. Ciao. [he and Erin kiss]
Why don't we say ciao to the impressions? [everyone says ciao]
Uh, I think you���re gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. [chuckles] It���ll be upsetting if you don���t.
So these are your cheeses, your ham, your sausages, your herbs, and your vegetables. Here's what's been done, so start creating. Some times it helps to think of a part of the world, and...
There are plenty of people who love touching me. [camera zooms to Ryan, who looks at the camera, extremely skeptical] I'm a terrific hugger. I've been with a bunch of girls where that's basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.
They say that if you can strengthen your core, it improves your sexual performance. So, you will find me on the Ab-Blaster. And then you will find me blasting...uh, a very nice young woman.
[as Lincoln] I just don't understand. It's 1865, victory is ours, I've saved the very soul of our nation, and yet... happiness eludes me. Oh, perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits.
I'm sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on. [Jim and Pam struggling to stay awake] Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way?
Erin and I make great use of ours.
To Robert California, from the moment you entered our building and our hearts, you...
Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy.
Good morning. [suitcase falls and he laughs awkwardly]
Well Darryl, considering that I basically own the place, I'm just chillin' at mi casa. This is me, in repose..I suppose.
Oh, he is. He's the co-manager, and that's the other co-manager.
You're really going to like Bill. He, uh, he has me toilet a lot of people for him. [Dwight sighs, Gabe's phone rings] Hallway phone, Gabe Lewis speaking.
Toby I'm going to tell you her last name tomorrow because she's going to be screaming it tonight.
I get it. Andy's slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam.
No, I'm gonna stand where I want. Okay? You don't wanna get on my bad side! I've seen some horrible things! I own over two hundred horror movies!
Ohh. Dropping bombs, right? [explosion noise] This really make you think, Michael?
Um, hi, uh, my name is Gabe Lewis. I am coordinating director for merging regions.
We are very impressed with this branch and we are so excited about this merger.
You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the gang.
Oh, this is 'Print in All Colors,' Sabre's minority executive training program.
Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood. [laughs] Not every day.
Statements of such nature, while they have their place, are overused in a competitive business environment.
What kind of music are you into, Peter?
I'll let this slide, but I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you.
Yeah. I don't want to be offensive but, uh... may I ask you what that means?
So, tonight I was thinking, I'm gonna go to the cemetery. I'm gonna drink a little wine and I thought maybe you'd like to come with me.
The problem, unfortunately, is about the office administrator. I have gone through everything for the past three years. There is nothing that says you are the office administrator.
Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets.
Well... it's an interview, and we don't know that you really have the plan.
[walking back into the office] That was ugly. I'm sorry you had to see that.
I technically cannot. I don't have the lung capacity to blow a whistle.
[Andy walks by with DeAngelo, says quietly after he leaves] Walk away bitch.
Yeah. He told me you two broke up.
I know what it smells like but I didn't roll in anything. It's from listening to all of Gabe's bull[bleep]. [laughter] 'Isn't this the perfect romantic getaway, Erin? Sitting on a deserted island wearing dog costumes? I'm Gabe and I'm a weirdo.'
How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR?
Okay, why don't we simplify this? Darryl brings it to Michael, Michael brings it to me, no one calls Jo.
This is Michael Scott, co-regional manager of this branch.
CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes.
Will do... Can I get one of those name plates... that says Gabe Lewis?
So I got us a compromise. This movie's called 'Hardware'. It tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like Wall-e, that the government invented to destroy humans. It's some of what you like and some of what I like, and... married...
[bell dings] Guys, that's the elevator. What if it's him?
I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out. You said, and I quote, 'My good sir! Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand.' I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way.
Pam, I don't want to accuse you of anything. I just want everything to be back the way it's supposed to be. Can you just admit... admit...
Oh, is it okay with you? Because if it's not, you work for me, so... Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and contracts governing our business. Be honest, fair-
I've got just the thing! [leaves, comes back with a synthesizer] This one's called Earth Rise, on the Moon. [music plays]
Yup. We could watch some right now if you want. I got a Korean film on my iPod if you want to just- if you have the cables.
I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.
Well, uh... why don't you just tell me a little about yourself, Hide.
You never know with Jo. Sometimes we're here til midnight. Sometimes she doesn't show up for three days.
I dominate Valentine's Day. I practically make romance into a science.
Oh, Jo. Jo, I'm disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was...
Oh, well I'm still the corporate liaison to the branch.
I am as smooth as a porpoise. {Erin argues]
No. I don't like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?
Oh boy. Can you get every department head's signature on this so I can back this up to corporate?
Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women's room.
Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics.
It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened.
Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It's come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or e-mail this around.
Ok. Ok there. I heard that. So I'm sorry, Pam, but that's it. I'm going to have to suspend you without pay for two days.
We just want to say how grateful we are.
Apparently, I bear a passing resemblance to Abraham Lincoln. Makes it kind of hard for me to go to places like museums, historical monuments, elementary schools... I don't see it.
Chelsea's Mom: Chelsea, give Mr. Lincoln your hat so I can take a picture.
Oh, thank God. I had a horrible nightmare that I was stuck in America with Gabe.'
I get the sense that Val enjoys a good putdown. Considering that's the only thing I know about her. I will be milking that hard. [Gestures milking a cow]
No. [Robert then nods his head at Jim]
Core���s critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One ��� lengthen. Two ��� elongate.
What do you want me to say? I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. [to Jim and Toby] Are we all just gonna pretend to-- okay. [to Kelly] Um, what are your weaknesses?
Actually, that's Nick. He's your new IT guy. Uh, he's setting up a site blocker. Mostly blocking the inappropriate sites.  And then there are the time-wasting sites like Twitter, YouTube. We are blocking those as well.
How many windows are there in New York City?
Because I am. I need to get her back. [crying] I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?
Okay. We're going to table the hat question. The best ideas are going to come to me, I make the final decision, period.
Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush! [Gabe makes a flushing motion, Dwight twists Gabe's arm] Ow!
Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?
Whoa! That's a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.
[lowers volum] Some of us are trying to have a conversation.
Oh my God, I can't look at roaches.
Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the shortlist for next time there's an opening.
And, uh, you will do your counseling right here, because our HR staff are all certified counselors.
Whom I'm seeing is Val from down in the warehouse.
How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability. [makes a 'zero' hand gesture]
Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis.
I've read- and I don't know anything about this personally- but they say prostate stimulation can help.
Michael, you just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private?
Abe and Mary are seated watching the show. [in Lincoln voice] Oh Mary this is wonderful��� Ok Mary stop your scolding.  I���ll be quiet. [aside to the audience] I need her like I need a hole in the head! [scattered chuckles from the crowd] [Gabe raises his hand with a finger pointed in the shape of a gun to his head] BANG!  Ooh [Gabe falls to the ground and the crowd claps, Gabe picks up the Lincoln hat, bows, runs to the crowd and trades it back for his pink ���DM does GB��� hat and runs off]
No! You go away! [storms out, toilet flushes, Jim exits the bathroom]
In the future, you need to get Michael's approval on anything before coming to me.
[laughs, eventually Erin joins him laughing] Oh that would be scary!
We have a policy here at Sabre where we are, uh, allowed to take two weeks.
[on voicemail] You've reached Gabe Lewis, I'm currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao. [beep]
Great! [to Jim and Toby] Um, can we just... [does a 'wrap it up' motion with his pen]
I started dating Erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite.
Those overnight packages needed to go out, and Michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable.
The cinema of the unsettling is a growing film movement.  The most well known film in the genre is an hour long shot of a squirrel with diarrhea.
Most of our business comes from selling printers. So don't think of yourselves as paper salesmen anymore, but as printer salesmen who also sell paper.
Yeah. But not just bagels. All unwanted problems. Question: What's the most important appliance in your house?
Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. Kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor. [clapping] All right.
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
[sees Andy walk into the Men's Room and follows him in] Stay away from Erin! [cornering him in the bathroom]
Well, Toby's in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby's done a fine job.
You know what? Let me see what I can do.
That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves.
Uh uh. Corporate stole nothing, okay? Darryl told me, and then I told them, giving Darryl full credit, so... no need to [mimicking Andy] screw corporate! Or anything like that, so. Let's give Darryl a round of applause, as planned. [claps]
I can't believe I didn't think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel! Why are you talking to Stanley's mistress?
Oh, uh, no. No, no, no, no. I'm, uh, I'm actually with a tour group myself, so- [laughter] Hello! I'm Abraham Lincoln! Some people call me the great emancipator, but, uh, you might know me from the penny. [laughter]
Hey. I need you to get the paperwork rolling on a new workplace relationship.
I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he's a rat, and I think he's responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,... he broke up the happiest couple in this office!
Yeah we had a whole conversation about Mondays���
- of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, Michael.
Uh, excuse me, excuse me. How does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming?
It's like a hula hoop. Right. Mele Kalikimaka is the wise way.
Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. It's either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed.
I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who don't get the reference, making them feel like the other.
[walking with Jim and Pam] Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life.
Sure. Basically, there's no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem.
Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn't this where you fell in love?
Ok, I'm sorry but I am going to have to shut this down.
Ok, um, I told the story of your uncle, and I have a feeling that you would have [Michael gesturing behind computer] really been proud of the way... Okay, um...
Okay. So, PDAs. That's gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh...
This wasn't really about Meredith was it. You and Erin are broken up.
I would also like to toast Robert California. Mr. California,...
Uh, it's a condo and it's long-term business housing.
No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying.
That is Jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office.
You know, times were tough. I was unemployed, I was still heart-broken over you, I've lost a good fifty pounds. But as you can see I put all that weight right back on. Feel how fat my buttocks are. Yeah, it's crazy. Touch it. It's like a warm pumpkin.
Gabe's mom... hmm... Gabe's mom? Wait. Tall woman? Looks like Gabe? Yeah, I banged her.'
That is not how it seems to me.
Ok, did everyone get one? With these bottles, we eliminate the need for plastic water bottles, which are the scourge of the environment.
Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again?
Very unprofessional, 'Jacques.' Or, should I say, Dwight.
Yeah, that would be awesome. I could get a girlfriend. Wouldn't have to go to Amsterdam seven times a year. But uh, I'm young, right?  I will date when I'm dead! [Laughs]
Corporate wants me up here, Dunder Mifflin wants me down there. What they worked out is that Monday, Wednesday and Friday I'm here in Scranton, Tuesday Thursday I'm in Tallahassee, I mean I feel like Vera Farmiga in Up in the Air, you know? More money more problems. Although, I didn't get a raise, so you know. Same money, more problems.
I'm not technically seeing her, but uh I've seen her, with the eyes and uh there was attraction. In at least one direction. So..[holds up fist]
This is just, uh- This American Life, I think I heard it on.
And I overheard, and thought, hey, that'd be fun, don't mind if I do.
[to Toby] I hear them kissing all the time. It's this horrible plipping sound. You know, it's like Chinese water torture. Just...[makes popping sound] like it's coming from my own head.
[holding ball in open palm] Oh, yeah, totally.  Jim, you got ripped off big time.
Okay, I-I am, I'm almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. [Robert and Gabe chuckle at this, then Gabe stops chuckling] Do you, um, do you think that you are?
Can I buy everyone coffees? [everyone shakes their heads] [in Cookie Monster voice] 'Or cookies.'
Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe.
Well... it's just... [ringing] it messes up my rhythm.
I don't wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad.
Droswip, yeah.  I get it.  Okay, we're gonna get you to the restroom.
[to Cathy] Well, we'll say its eight-two and it'll be our secret.
No! We really shouldn't be without a receptionist. Now more than ever.
Just do it. You were the it that I was just doing.
I don't know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah.
The Michelin man called, he wants his cummerbund back.
Thank you all for meeting on such sort notice.
You know, there's this expression: Bro's before Ho's. And what that's short for is brothers before whores. Uh, I don't buy that. I would throw any brother under the bus for any whore. Woman.
Wake up, Fred. The power cord on your Sabre printer shocked you into a coma, and you're dreaming you're a dog on a desert island.'
I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They���d flex them all night at the discotheque.
[sounding hurt] I'm either going to quit today, or stay to make sure that Andy's career is destroyed.
The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don't respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I'm the I.T. guy. This Cookie Monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I'm an authority figure.
You must be pretty horny. [Erin shakes head no]
Seeing as it's Valentine's Day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace.
Well he���s probably a drug dealer. That���s the best way to land a hot girlfriend. You just uh get her hooked on blow.
Can you two please join me in my office? Now.
[makes buzzer sound] Too slow. It's the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential.
I don't know. All I know is the building.
I still wear Erin's button-downs around the condo sometimes. So it feels to me like we're still in a relationship-
That'd be hilarious. Uh, 'Jo, they're creating a hostile work environment. Stop  'em.'
We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so... [nods]
Well, that's actually what I came to talk to you about. I know how much you want to watch 'Wall-e'.
Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities.
Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology.
There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right?
I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen.
I picked out our movie. It's called 'Suspiria'. It pushes all the boundaries. All your preconceived notions about what horror can be come crashing down.
The alternative is termination. [Michael stares off, considering termination...]
I don't really see what the problem is. Erin doesn't even like sex, remember? You said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton.
Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we're still dating?
Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I���m pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines.
Corporate says to me, ���Gabe, we need you in Scranton.��� Scranton says, ���Gabe, go back down to Florida. You're needed there.��� So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm up there. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I'm down here. I can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying.
