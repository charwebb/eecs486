Come on.
Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the shortlist for next time there's an opening.
[enters] Happy birthday to Gabe!
Yeah. I don't want to be offensive but, uh... may I ask you what that means?
Ok, um, I told the story of your uncle, and I have a feeling that you would have [Michael gesturing behind computer] really been proud of the way... Okay, um...
I'll let this slide, but I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you.
Give me one night with you...
And that's straight from corporate. So not to be scary, but yeah, I would listen to me. And that's all. Ciao.
[holding ball in open palm] Oh, yeah, totally.  Jim, you got ripped off big time.
Yeah, booby honking. Sure.
Yeah it seems like there isn���t a narrative. [on screen a man gets into a car]  Maybe the filmmaker realized that even narrative is comforting.
Statements of such nature, while they have their place, are overused in a competitive business environment.
I'm gonna keep trying Jo.
Speed set. One. Two.
I get it. Andy's slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam.
Beautiful sentiment.
Seeing as it's Valentine's Day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace.
Thank you so much.
[following Jim and Pam to their car] Guys, to err is human. [trying to block their car]
[sounding hurt] I'm either going to quit today, or stay to make sure that Andy's career is destroyed.
First thing's first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would've just looped back to me, so, it's cool you recognized my role here.
[walking with Jim and Pam] Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life.
The Sabre Code of Conduct outlines the governing principles key to establishing and maintaining trust with our employees, clients-
Oh, well I'm still the corporate liaison to the branch.
Ok, well, I bet you can fit 20 little cups of water in your aluminum bottle.
This is Accounting.
No! You go away! [storms out, toilet flushes, Jim exits the bathroom]
Okay. So, PDAs. That's gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh...
Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk.
Erin and I make great use of ours.
That sounds like a promotion!
The cinema of the unsettling is a growing film movement.  The most well known film in the genre is an hour long shot of a squirrel with diarrhea.
Yes.  Lars and Decocco���s
I still wear Erin's button-downs around the condo sometimes. So it feels to me like we're still in a relationship-
I technically cannot. I don't have the lung capacity to blow a whistle.
Can you two please join me in my office? Now.
Ow! He went home.
Hello beautiful.
Wait, wait, you think she invented 'Talla-nasty?' [chuckles] no, no, no, no���
Honestly, it was a little weird.
Did someone say girl talk?
[to Toby] I hear them kissing all the time. It's this horrible plipping sound. You know, it's like Chinese water torture. Just...[makes popping sound] like it's coming from my own head.
At all.
Yes, I am.
I'm not technically seeing her, but uh I've seen her, with the eyes and uh there was attraction. In at least one direction. So..[holds up fist]
I'm feeling eighty-two, eighty-two and a half.
Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush! [Gabe makes a flushing motion, Dwight twists Gabe's arm] Ow!
Um, actually, if you don't mind, I would love to put this on the Sabre website. [correctly pronounced 'say-ber']
- of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, Michael.
It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened.
Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for.
What recommendation?
You must be pretty horny. [Erin shakes head no]
Well...
Good. Well, that's the spirit.
Yes. For Gabe.
Great.
At Sabre, we really encourage honest communication. You should always feel free to express your thoughts, your -
Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology.
You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the gang.
[dressed as Lady Gaga] In case you can't read m-m-my Poker Face... [laughs] we will be reviewing our sales policies. [accepts note from Michael, reads it out loud] I have ten seconds to read them or this whole place blows up.
Do you promise that?
Gabe Lewis.
Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn't this where you fell in love?
No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it's reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. One: You're taking MDMA. Street name, ecstasy. I've done it, and I know the feeling.
[Robert laughs] I live in this room.
Uh, not now.
[Andy is leaning over toilet] What happened?
The Michelin man called, he wants his cummerbund back.
Well, Toby's in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby's done a fine job.
When you're dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like. I wish my gym didn't allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. 'Cause it's policy. See what I mean?
And trustworthy in all your business activities and relationships. Treat one another-
[ahem][Pam snores] Guys?
[on phone] Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out.
I'm sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on. [Jim and Pam struggling to stay awake] Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way?
Thank you all for meeting on such sort notice.
The puzzle is the clue.
Hmm?
Number two: no pop culture references.
Yeah.
Uh, it's a condo and it's long-term business housing.
That is not how it seems to me.
Will you marry me?
Apparently, I bear a passing resemblance to Abraham Lincoln. Makes it kind of hard for me to go to places like museums, historical monuments, elementary schools... I don't see it.
Chelsea's Mom: Chelsea, give Mr. Lincoln your hat so I can take a picture.
Yeah.
Michael, this is irresponsible.
You don't really toss the dough.
320.  Just freeballin' it.
How much?
[laughs] Oh no no no no no no. She wouldn't even let me say it. It was adorable. She would plug her ears and scream her heat out.
Right, of course!
It's awful. [reaches for tissue box, hands it to Kevin]
Maybe you find your own chair.
Too kind doesn't begin to cover it.
Well, uh... why don't you just tell me a little about yourself, Hide.
Toby I'm going to tell you her last name tomorrow because she's going to be screaming it tonight.
Okay, good.
[as Michael and Jo leave] Are you leaving? Oh, am I... should I continue with the investigation?
Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit is to call this a stress-induced outburst.  You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling.
I have no idea.
Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN! [slams fist, hurting his hand]
Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.
Hey...
...a lot of the time.
That is correct.
Great.
I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.
Oh, this is 'Print in All Colors,' Sabre's minority executive training program.
I dominate Valentine's Day. I practically make romance into a science.
Uh, excuse me, excuse me. How does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming?
Are you still in love with Erin?
Wake up, Fred. The power cord on your Sabre printer shocked you into a coma, and you're dreaming you're a dog on a desert island.'
Well, that's actually what I came to talk to you about. I know how much you want to watch 'Wall-e'.
Monday's suck.
Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview.
We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so... [nods]
Oh boy. Can you get every department head's signature on this so I can back this up to corporate?
How many windows are there in New York City?
The alternative is termination. [Michael stares off, considering termination...]
And that goes double for me. I'll stay even later than you'd like.
I can see you in the jungle now.
Hey, guys.
Okay... [walks out embarrassed]
Dwight? What are you doing here?
We are very impressed with this branch and we are so excited about this merger.
Okay, you know what, you don't need to make that sound.
Most of our business comes from selling printers. So don't think of yourselves as paper salesmen anymore, but as printer salesmen who also sell paper.
Mm-hmm.
Well, Jo--
[Andy walks by with DeAngelo, says quietly after he leaves] Walk away bitch.
Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe.
Okay, that's not gonna be...
This is just, uh- This American Life, I think I heard it on.
You're doing great. You know, so good.
Okay.
Yeah, but she's not white, though.
Okay. That's great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else.
I love the burn. The burn is where I live.
Number two: You're desperately trying to fit in a whole relationship before Toby comes back from jury duty and Holly has to go back to Nashua. Or three: You're at an age where your sexual climaxes aren't as powerful so you need to overcompensate with foreplay, taboo behavior.
Uh, I think you���re gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. [chuckles] It���ll be upsetting if you don���t.
We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that.
Course I know.
I cannot believe that Andy is throwing a party like this just to impress the CEO. Classic Gabe move. Hey Andy, how about you don't steal my business strategies, and I won't dress like my life is just one long brunch?
And, uh, you will do your counseling right here, because our HR staff are all certified counselors.
A little un-specific.
Uh uh. Corporate stole nothing, okay? Darryl told me, and then I told them, giving Darryl full credit, so... no need to [mimicking Andy] screw corporate! Or anything like that, so. Let's give Darryl a round of applause, as planned. [claps]
Michael, you just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private?
What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. And... you did it. [nods at Andy]
You know what? Let me see what I can do.
I've got just the thing! [leaves, comes back with a synthesizer] This one's called Earth Rise, on the Moon. [music plays]
[on voicemail] You've reached Gabe Lewis, I'm currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao. [beep]
Hey, Jim? Are you distracting these people?
Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard. [Erin looks shocked] Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what - what God is. But for all of the disbelief [phone rings] I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum [phone continues ringing] out... there... uh, do we not have voicemail?
Um, hi, uh, my name is Gabe Lewis. I am coordinating director for merging regions.
I know.
To Robert California, from the moment you entered our building and our hearts, you...
How would we know that, if you don't...
Oh, thank God. I had a horrible nightmare that I was stuck in America with Gabe.'
Ok. [office laughs] No no no.
I've read- and I don't know anything about this personally- but they say prostate stimulation can help.
...I'm sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations.
You marked severe in all the categories, including at risk for homicidal behavior.
Oh, come on. My rules could not possibly have been that oppressive.
Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood. [laughs] Not every day.
Really? All kinds? So you like songs of hate written by the white knights of the Ku Klux Klan?
I'm sorry. This can't wait.
This is violent and offensive.
They don't touch. They don't kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife.
Fun fact. In France, they call Limitless 'The Man with Many Capabilities.'
That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves.
I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he's a rat, and I think he's responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,... he broke up the happiest couple in this office!
We got it?
They don't make these cords in boot cut anymore!
How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability. [makes a 'zero' hand gesture]
My entire childhood, I was the one left out, and I said to myself: Gabe, if you just achieve some success, you'll be part of them. You'll be part of the happy ones. But instead, people just used my success as a new way to shut me out.
I will make this sexier than you could ever imagine.
I started dating Erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite.
Ok, but once this starts, it's going to be moving fast. It's going to be hot and heavy and I don't want a bunch of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around my jock. You know?
Let's go ahead and wash our hands.
Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. Kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor. [clapping] All right.
Which ones?
Ok, did everyone get one? With these bottles, we eliminate the need for plastic water bottles, which are the scourge of the environment.
All right. Uh, Stan, you're up.
I get the sense that Val enjoys a good putdown. Considering that's the only thing I know about her. I will be milking that hard. [Gestures milking a cow]
[bell dings] Guys, that's the elevator. What if it's him?
We have a policy here at Sabre where we are, uh, allowed to take two weeks.
Uh, it was.
Great! [to Jim and Toby] Um, can we just... [does a 'wrap it up' motion with his pen]
Ok. Ok there. I heard that. So I'm sorry, Pam, but that's it. I'm going to have to suspend you without pay for two days.
Ok where does Gabe factor in?
Yeah.
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.
Whom I'm seeing is Val from down in the warehouse.
Yeah. He told me you two broke up.
Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important. [Pam hands Jim a note] It's not about showing you're in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It's about forgiveness. And yes, I'm talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension.
That'd be hilarious. Uh, 'Jo, they're creating a hostile work environment. Stop  'em.'
So, tonight I was thinking, I'm gonna go to the cemetery. I'm gonna drink a little wine and I thought maybe you'd like to come with me.
Hey, guys.
Okay...
There are plenty of people who love touching me. [camera zooms to Ryan, who looks at the camera, extremely skeptical] I'm a terrific hugger. I've been with a bunch of girls where that's basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.
Yup. We could watch some right now if you want. I got a Korean film on my iPod if you want to just- if you have the cables.
Erin, I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God. [Erin and Angela both look taken aback]
Can I buy everyone coffees? [everyone shakes their heads] [in Cookie Monster voice] 'Or cookies.'
I'll just turn the captions on.
What?
Yes?
Hey, Andy?
Nice guy.
I need to talk to you!
I don't want to say it.
Well, get to work.
Um. I set my stuff up in there. So...  just give me a few minutes to clean that out for you.
Tasteless?
Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It's come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or e-mail this around.
That's very nice. [referring to Kelly's bindi] I never noticed that before.
Okay, Quick.
Okay. We're going to table the hat question. The best ideas are going to come to me, I make the final decision, period.
I'm back! Ha ha. Pam, perfect. I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem.
So, I won.
See ya Oscar! [Oscar leaves]
Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we're still dating?
Ok let me go get it.
You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate. A two-week training program at the Yale school of management, obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities.
Decaf frap-
Hey. I need you to get the paperwork rolling on a new workplace relationship.
[to Val] Hey. You're welcome.
What?
I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen.
Too late! Oh. Ha. An IM chat. Very clever. I'll just print that out. Come on guys. Grow up. I don't want to be your babysitter.
Why don't we say ciao to the impressions? [everyone says ciao]
Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a fire, so your appointment got-
Shove his sashimi!
Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I���m pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines.
In the future, you need to get Michael's approval on anything before coming to me.
Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat.
It's like a hula hoop. Right. Mele Kalikimaka is the wise way.
You're really going to like Bill. He, uh, he has me toilet a lot of people for him. [Dwight sighs, Gabe's phone rings] Hallway phone, Gabe Lewis speaking.
Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy.
I don't wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad.
I don't want to hear it. Suspended.
Go get 'em. Start quipin'.
I'm not sure the temporary replacement of an H.R. rep really warrants a party.
Because I am. I need to get her back. [crying] I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?
That's for the other box.
Well, it's nine miles away. I'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf.
Darn it Bob. I told you not to buy a Sabre brand lifeboat.' [laughter]
Yep.
[on the phone] You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right. [hangs up]
No no. No no no.
The problem, unfortunately, is about the office administrator. I have gone through everything for the past three years. There is nothing that says you are the office administrator.
Yeah, that would be awesome. I could get a girlfriend. Wouldn't have to go to Amsterdam seven times a year. But uh, I'm young, right?  I will date when I'm dead! [Laughs]
I picked out our movie. It's called 'Suspiria'. It pushes all the boundaries. All your preconceived notions about what horror can be come crashing down.
Hey! Watch it.
And I overheard, and thought, hey, that'd be fun, don't mind if I do.
What do you want me to say? I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. [to Jim and Toby] Are we all just gonna pretend to-- okay. [to Kelly] Um, what are your weaknesses?
No. I don't like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?
Oh? Uh... we haven't started the interview yet. Were you--were you joking?
No! We really shouldn't be without a receptionist. Now more than ever.
Ohh. Dropping bombs, right? [explosion noise] This really make you think, Michael?
Well... it's an interview, and we don't know that you really have the plan.
Nope.
[makes buzzer sound] Too slow. It's the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential.
Steve Martin. [laughs, then falls] uh, I'm fine. [grunts]
Ok.
Sweetheart.
[stands up and walks to stage, takes the microphone] Well, this is embarrassing, um, I'm obviously really angry at Erin. It's that quarter life crisis everyone's been talking about. [Jim is looking wide eyed, jaw dropped] Alright I'm gonna go. [Dwight plays cricket noises]
You're right, we don't need a hat.
Good.
[talking on the phone] So I can reprimand them but I can't suspend them. Oh I can't do either. Uh huh. Fair enough.
I can't believe I didn't think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel! Why are you talking to Stanley's mistress?
Nice pelvic bowl. Deep.
I would also like to toast Robert California. Mr. California,...
Erin, are you even hearing this?
No, I'm gonna stand where I want. Okay? You don't wanna get on my bad side! I've seen some horrible things! I own over two hundred horror movies!
Yay Robert!
Okay, guys, fun is fun, but-
That is Jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office.
Not here.
Ow! Ow! Stephanie, help!
You had something important to tell me?
I don't know. All I know is the building.
And Gabe-y makes three.
Well... it's just... [ringing] it messes up my rhythm.
I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who don't get the reference, making them feel like the other.
I don't know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah.
Can you at least
Yep! Waste not right?
No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying.
Erin, I've been to Japan. I know how to use chopsticks so well. Come back. One night.
Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities.
You know, times were tough. I was unemployed, I was still heart-broken over you, I've lost a good fifty pounds. But as you can see I put all that weight right back on. Feel how fat my buttocks are. Yeah, it's crazy. Touch it. It's like a warm pumpkin.
Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis.
I don't really see what the problem is. Erin doesn't even like sex, remember? You said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton.
Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels?
Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again?
Okay, why don't we simplify this? Darryl brings it to Michael, Michael brings it to me, no one calls Jo.
Look at this, this is enormous.
Well Darryl, considering that I basically own the place, I'm just chillin' at mi casa. This is me, in repose..I suppose.
Oh, uh, no. No, no, no, no. I'm, uh, I'm actually with a tour group myself, so- [laughter] Hello! I'm Abraham Lincoln! Some people call me the great emancipator, but, uh, you might know me from the penny. [laughter]
I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out. You said, and I quote, 'My good sir! Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand.' I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way.
It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some 'Slumdog Millionaire' scenario, where every word she's playing has a connection to her orphan past. It's possible.
Umm... 'You don't have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, I'm the only one here.' Ha.
Corporate says to me, ���Gabe, we need you in Scranton.��� Scranton says, ���Gabe, go back down to Florida. You're needed there.��� So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm up there. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I'm down here. I can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying.
Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. It's either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed.
So these are your cheeses, your ham, your sausages, your herbs, and your vegetables. Here's what's been done, so start creating. Some times it helps to think of a part of the world, and...
Just read the letter under your windshield wiper, it explains everything. Quick one. [leans in for a kiss]
My gym allows it. I wish they didn't, but it's policy. So I respect it, and I just--[put's his hands cupped by his face and turns away] keep a low--you know, I look away. Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room.
Whoa! That's a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.
Will do... Can I get one of those name plates... that says Gabe Lewis?
[sees Andy walk into the Men's Room and follows him in] Stay away from Erin! [cornering him in the bathroom]
Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV?
Was it Pam?
Why do you keep repeating - [Michael hangs up]
Umm, Pam?
You never know with Jo. Sometimes we're here til midnight. Sometimes she doesn't show up for three days.
Little cups? Like paper or plastic or... ?
I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They���d flex them all night at the discotheque.
They're going to be pretty pleased in Tallahassee that I snagged an Indian for the program. She'll be the first. The program's mostly black. It's almost too black. That didn't sound right.
I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.
Got it.
Over here is Meredith Palmer and Creed Bratton.
All right.
You know, there's this expression: Bro's before Ho's. And what that's short for is brothers before whores. Uh, I don't buy that. I would throw any brother under the bus for any whore. Woman.
Good morning. [suitcase falls and he laughs awkwardly]
[lowers volum] Some of us are trying to have a conversation.
Yeah, unless somebody else applies today.
Just do it. You were the it that I was just doing.
When our warehouse workers make deliveries, they're going to be encouraged to offer clients extra products. And then they will split those commissions with sales.
Okay, I-I am, I'm almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. [Robert and Gabe chuckle at this, then Gabe stops chuckling] Do you, um, do you think that you are?
I'm your boss!
First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you'd expect to hear from corporate. Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances.
This wasn't really about Meredith was it. You and Erin are broken up.
Those overnight packages needed to go out, and Michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable.
I have shaved everything...
No, not nice. Terrible. Doesn't even include the fact that they're dogs.
[laughs, eventually Erin joins him laughing] Oh that would be scary!
Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women's room.
It's for protecting my ass. When you suckers lift more than you can handle. Sup, I'm Gabe. Corporate. Continue. Don't be nervous.
I'm gonna head back to Siberia there. Ciao. [he and Erin kiss]
Ok final thing, and this is a fun one: Instead of writing the caption directly under the picture, let's all try using Sticky Quips. All right? New, from Dunder Mifflin Sabre.
Hey.
So what, no one's even gonna try?
[takes remote] It's a little loud...
Oh, he is. He's the co-manager, and that's the other co-manager.
Oh, how the mediocre have fallen.
Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets.
Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim. [Dwight starts to clap] Ok fine. You too Dwight.
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Corporate wants me up here, Dunder Mifflin wants me down there. What they worked out is that Monday, Wednesday and Friday I'm here in Scranton, Tuesday Thursday I'm in Tallahassee, I mean I feel like Vera Farmiga in Up in the Air, you know? More money more problems. Although, I didn't get a raise, so you know. Same money, more problems.
So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation?
I know what it smells like but I didn't roll in anything. It's from listening to all of Gabe's bull[bleep]. [laughter] 'Isn't this the perfect romantic getaway, Erin? Sitting on a deserted island wearing dog costumes? I'm Gabe and I'm a weirdo.'
Sure. Basically, there's no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem.
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
Oh, is it okay with you? Because if it's not, you work for me, so... Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and contracts governing our business. Be honest, fair-
This is Michael Scott, co-regional manager of this branch.
More tasteless than this...'is that a palm tree or did Gabe get skinnier? Either way, let's pee on it.'  [laughter]
You have some food on your face.
Erin you don't have to...
Well he���s probably a drug dealer. That���s the best way to land a hot girlfriend. You just uh get her hooked on blow.
You have to be a minority.
Pam, I don't want to accuse you of anything. I just want everything to be back the way it's supposed to be. Can you just admit... admit...
The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don't respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I'm the I.T. guy. This Cookie Monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I'm an authority figure.
What happens if you're the hunchback?
I am as smooth as a porpoise. {Erin argues]
CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes.
There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right?
[on videochat]  First let me say that I told them everything you wanted me to say, in just the way you wanted me to say it, so...
Your wish is my command.
Ooh.
Actually, that's Nick. He's your new IT guy. Uh, he's setting up a site blocker. Mostly blocking the inappropriate sites.  And then there are the time-wasting sites like Twitter, YouTube. We are blocking those as well.
[walking back into the office] That was ugly. I'm sorry you had to see that.
I know, right?
No, I was not.
Everyone, our very own Angela-
Very unprofessional, 'Jacques.' Or, should I say, Dwight.
I didn't know Darryl joined.
[to Cathy] Well, we'll say its eight-two and it'll be our secret.
Oh my God, I can't look at roaches.
Yes, it is.
Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?
Okay, while this is interesting we should get back to work. These stand-offs can last a long time. What if it's another Waco.
It's still on upstairs.
Butt honking. Yeah, all the honking.
[laughs] Total brain burp.
Darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He's gone.
I'm such a klutz!
Give or take. [Deangelo walks out]
Intercepted!
I could quit. Problem solved.
[as Lincoln] I just don't understand. It's 1865, victory is ours, I've saved the very soul of our nation, and yet... happiness eludes me. Oh, perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits.
Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics.
You have to cut it out.
And what do we have here?
