Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important. [Pam hands Jim a note] It's not about showing you're in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It's about forgiveness. And yes, I'm talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension.
That is correct.
Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN! [slams fist, hurting his hand]
[walking back into the office] That was ugly. I'm sorry you had to see that.
Nice pelvic bowl. Deep.
Ok. [office laughs] No no no.
I get the sense that Val enjoys a good putdown. Considering that's the only thing I know about her. I will be milking that hard. [Gestures milking a cow]
Was it Pam?
Can I buy everyone coffees? [everyone shakes their heads] [in Cookie Monster voice] 'Or cookies.'
You have some food on your face.
Erin you don't have to...
Okay, while this is interesting we should get back to work. These stand-offs can last a long time. What if it's another Waco.
Five. Six.
Yay Robert!
Give or take. [Deangelo walks out]
Nice guy.
Hello beautiful.
Well, Toby's in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby's done a fine job.
Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. It's either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed.
I'm your boss!
We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that.
Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood. [laughs] Not every day.
No! We really shouldn't be without a receptionist. Now more than ever.
Yep.
Got it.
Most of our business comes from selling printers. So don't think of yourselves as paper salesmen anymore, but as printer salesmen who also sell paper.
I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue.
Monday's suck.
Will you marry me?
Hey Darryl, I was thinking, uh, maybe while we read through this, uh, you could grab us all some coffee. My treat. It's a hundred dollar bill. Should cover it I think. Don't bring me any of that caramel soy latte crap, ok? I want a decaf frappuccino. Val���
Ok where does Gabe factor in?
Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy.
That's very nice. [referring to Kelly's bindi] I never noticed that before.
Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I���m pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines.
When you're dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like. I wish my gym didn't allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. 'Cause it's policy. See what I mean?
Well...
Really? All kinds? So you like songs of hate written by the white knights of the Ku Klux Klan?
Yes, it is.
You know what? Let me see what I can do.
Well Darryl, considering that I basically own the place, I'm just chillin' at mi casa. This is me, in repose..I suppose.
You never know with Jo. Sometimes we're here til midnight. Sometimes she doesn't show up for three days.
I know, right?
What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. And... you did it. [nods at Andy]
Oh, this is 'Print in All Colors,' Sabre's minority executive training program.
When our warehouse workers make deliveries, they're going to be encouraged to offer clients extra products. And then they will split those commissions with sales.
Ow! He went home.
Ooh.
Good morning. [suitcase falls and he laughs awkwardly]
[on videochat]  First let me say that I told them everything you wanted me to say, in just the way you wanted me to say it, so...
Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit is to call this a stress-induced outburst.  You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling.
[walks in] Gotta catch a plane.
No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying.
Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology.
Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard. [Erin looks shocked] Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what - what God is. But for all of the disbelief [phone rings] I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum [phone continues ringing] out... there... uh, do we not have voicemail?
Oh, is it okay with you? Because if it's not, you work for me, so... Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and contracts governing our business. Be honest, fair-
Um, hi, uh, my name is Gabe Lewis. I am coordinating director for merging regions.
[makes buzzer sound] Too slow. It's the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential.
Ok. Ok there. I heard that. So I'm sorry, Pam, but that's it. I'm going to have to suspend you without pay for two days.
Oh, thank God. I had a horrible nightmare that I was stuck in America with Gabe.'
No, no, I'm-
Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.
Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush! [Gabe makes a flushing motion, Dwight twists Gabe's arm] Ow!
The puzzle is the clue.
...I'm sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations.
Okay... [walks out embarrassed]
What?
[on phone] Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out.
That is Jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office.
Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis.
That's for the other box.
Hey! Watch it.
The alternative is termination. [Michael stares off, considering termination...]
Yeah it seems like there isn���t a narrative. [on screen a man gets into a car]  Maybe the filmmaker realized that even narrative is comforting.
Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities.
Thank you so much.
You marked severe in all the categories, including at risk for homicidal behavior.
[sounding hurt] I'm either going to quit today, or stay to make sure that Andy's career is destroyed.
Everyone, our very own Angela-
I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out. You said, and I quote, 'My good sir! Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand.' I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way.
Oh, come on. My rules could not possibly have been that oppressive.
I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They���d flex them all night at the discotheque.
To Robert California, from the moment you entered our building and our hearts, you...
I'm gonna keep trying Jo.
Darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He's gone.
We just want to say how grateful we are.
Why don't we say ciao to the impressions? [everyone says ciao]
You had something important to tell me?
How much?
I dominate Valentine's Day. I practically make romance into a science.
You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate. A two-week training program at the Yale school of management, obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities.
I can't believe I didn't think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel! Why are you talking to Stanley's mistress?
Yeah.
Gabe's mom... hmm... Gabe's mom? Wait. Tall woman? Looks like Gabe? Yeah, I banged her.'
Yes?
[Andy is leaning over toilet] What happened?
[takes remote] It's a little loud...
I don't know. All I know is the building.
Abe and Mary are seated watching the show. [in Lincoln voice] Oh Mary this is wonderful��� Ok Mary stop your scolding.  I���ll be quiet. [aside to the audience] I need her like I need a hole in the head! [scattered chuckles from the crowd] [Gabe raises his hand with a finger pointed in the shape of a gun to his head] BANG!  Ooh [Gabe falls to the ground and the crowd claps, Gabe picks up the Lincoln hat, bows, runs to the crowd and trades it back for his pink ���DM does GB��� hat and runs off]
They're going to be pretty pleased in Tallahassee that I snagged an Indian for the program. She'll be the first. The program's mostly black. It's almost too black. That didn't sound right.
Okay, Quick.
I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who don't get the reference, making them feel like the other.
Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat.
So, I won.
Um. I set my stuff up in there. So...  just give me a few minutes to clean that out for you.
Hey, guys.
I picked out our movie. It's called 'Suspiria'. It pushes all the boundaries. All your preconceived notions about what horror can be come crashing down.
Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe.
Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets.
Go get 'em. Start quipin'.
[enters] Happy birthday to Gabe!
Oh, uh, no. No, no, no, no. I'm, uh, I'm actually with a tour group myself, so- [laughter] Hello! I'm Abraham Lincoln! Some people call me the great emancipator, but, uh, you might know me from the penny. [laughter]
No. [Robert then nods his head at Jim]
It's awful. [reaches for tissue box, hands it to Kevin]
Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview.
You must be pretty horny. [Erin shakes head no]
All right.
Erin, I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God. [Erin and Angela both look taken aback]
I will make this sexier than you could ever imagine.
Nope.
My entire childhood, I was the one left out, and I said to myself: Gabe, if you just achieve some success, you'll be part of them. You'll be part of the happy ones. But instead, people just used my success as a new way to shut me out.
Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics.
Okay. We're going to table the hat question. The best ideas are going to come to me, I make the final decision, period.
Alright.
I could quit. Problem solved.
I can see you in the jungle now.
I got a tattoo for you.
We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so... [nods]
Well, it's nine miles away. I'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf.
Which ones?
I'm not sure the temporary replacement of an H.R. rep really warrants a party.
First thing's first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would've just looped back to me, so, it's cool you recognized my role here.
Uh.
Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim. [Dwight starts to clap] Ok fine. You too Dwight.
I get it. Andy's slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam.
So I got us a compromise. This movie's called 'Hardware'. It tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like Wall-e, that the government invented to destroy humans. It's some of what you like and some of what I like, and... married...
Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk.
Uh, it was.
Okay. That's great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else.
What?
Ok, but once this starts, it's going to be moving fast. It's going to be hot and heavy and I don't want a bunch of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around my jock. You know?
I cannot believe that Andy is throwing a party like this just to impress the CEO. Classic Gabe move. Hey Andy, how about you don't steal my business strategies, and I won't dress like my life is just one long brunch?
Well, that's actually what I came to talk to you about. I know how much you want to watch 'Wall-e'.
What kind of music are you into, Peter?
Okay, I-I am, I'm almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. [Robert and Gabe chuckle at this, then Gabe stops chuckling] Do you, um, do you think that you are?
[on voicemail] You've reached Gabe Lewis, I'm currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao. [beep]
Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again?
Well, I wish that I could do something, but it's kind of policy, you know? Above my pay grade. You know?
Whom I'm seeing is Val from down in the warehouse.
Well... it's an interview, and we don't know that you really have the plan.
Well, that's gonna be tough, because we're getting a dunking clinic from Magic Jordan himself.
Well... it's just... [ringing] it messes up my rhythm.
Hey...
No. I don't like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?
You're really going to like Bill. He, uh, he has me toilet a lot of people for him. [Dwight sighs, Gabe's phone rings] Hallway phone, Gabe Lewis speaking.
I'm gonna head back to Siberia there. Ciao. [he and Erin kiss]
This is just, uh- This American Life, I think I heard it on.
Oh, I am so in.
Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we're still dating?
That sounds like a promotion!
Okay, guys, fun is fun, but-
So leave.
Yeah we had a whole conversation about Mondays���
I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.
You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the gang.
Okay, you know what, you don't need to make that sound.
Steve Martin. [laughs, then falls] uh, I'm fine. [grunts]
I've read- and I don't know anything about this personally- but they say prostate stimulation can help.
Umm... 'You don't have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, I'm the only one here.' Ha.
Can you two please join me in my office? Now.
No no. No no no.
Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for.
Yeah. I don't want to be offensive but, uh... may I ask you what that means?
This is Accounting.
Thank you all for meeting on such sort notice.
I know.
Yeah. But not just bagels. All unwanted problems. Question: What's the most important appliance in your house?
You don't really toss the dough.
[Robert laughs] I live in this room.
So these are your cheeses, your ham, your sausages, your herbs, and your vegetables. Here's what's been done, so start creating. Some times it helps to think of a part of the world, and...
Droswip, yeah.  I get it.  Okay, we're gonna get you to the restroom.
Uh, not now.
It���s one of the most common fetishes.
There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right?
Yep! Waste not right?
You know, there's this expression: Bro's before Ho's. And what that's short for is brothers before whores. Uh, I don't buy that. I would throw any brother under the bus for any whore. Woman.
I don't want to hear it. Suspended.
I have no idea.
Um, actually, if you don't mind, I would love to put this on the Sabre website. [correctly pronounced 'say-ber']
[sees Andy walk into the Men's Room and follows him in] Stay away from Erin! [cornering him in the bathroom]
It's still on upstairs.
Too kind doesn't begin to cover it.
What happens if you're the hunchback?
See ya Oscar! [Oscar leaves]
[ahem][Pam snores] Guys?
Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a fire, so your appointment got-
Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn't this where you fell in love?
A little un-specific.
I'm not technically seeing her, but uh I've seen her, with the eyes and uh there was attraction. In at least one direction. So..[holds up fist]
Okay, good.
Oh, Jo. Jo, I'm disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was...
[reveals Stanley's moustache] Ah! Ha ha ha!
I know what it smells like but I didn't roll in anything. It's from listening to all of Gabe's bull[bleep]. [laughter] 'Isn't this the perfect romantic getaway, Erin? Sitting on a deserted island wearing dog costumes? I'm Gabe and I'm a weirdo.'
Can you at least
Why do you keep repeating - [Michael hangs up]
Yeah, that would be awesome. I could get a girlfriend. Wouldn't have to go to Amsterdam seven times a year. But uh, I'm young, right?  I will date when I'm dead! [Laughs]
And that's straight from corporate. So not to be scary, but yeah, I would listen to me. And that's all. Ciao.
This wasn't really about Meredith was it. You and Erin are broken up.
Darn it Bob. I told you not to buy a Sabre brand lifeboat.' [laughter]
Over here is Meredith Palmer and Creed Bratton.
Ok, um, I told the story of your uncle, and I have a feeling that you would have [Michael gesturing behind computer] really been proud of the way... Okay, um...
Too late! Oh. Ha. An IM chat. Very clever. I'll just print that out. Come on guys. Grow up. I don't want to be your babysitter.
Good.
Yeah. He told me you two broke up.
It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened.
I'll let this slide, but I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you.
I am as smooth as a porpoise. {Erin argues]
Do you promise that?
Whoa! That's a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.
I'll just turn the captions on.
And, uh, you will do your counseling right here, because our HR staff are all certified counselors.
Erin, I've been to Japan. I know how to use chopsticks so well. Come back. One night.
No! You go away! [storms out, toilet flushes, Jim exits the bathroom]
Oh, close. It's a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck.
In the future, you need to get Michael's approval on anything before coming to me.
Hey, Jim? Are you distracting these people?
Uh, I think you���re gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. [chuckles] It���ll be upsetting if you don���t.
That is not how it seems to me.
[to Cathy] Well, we'll say its eight-two and it'll be our secret.
Very unprofessional, 'Jacques.' Or, should I say, Dwight.
Right, of course!
Corporate wants me up here, Dunder Mifflin wants me down there. What they worked out is that Monday, Wednesday and Friday I'm here in Scranton, Tuesday Thursday I'm in Tallahassee, I mean I feel like Vera Farmiga in Up in the Air, you know? More money more problems. Although, I didn't get a raise, so you know. Same money, more problems.
[Andy walks by with DeAngelo, says quietly after he leaves] Walk away bitch.
I'm feeling eighty-two, eighty-two and a half.
No, not nice. Terrible. Doesn't even include the fact that they're dogs.
Oh, I don't get that sense at all from you, so...
Okay, well, obviously if it's a really, really good idea, my door is open.
Uh, it's a condo and it's long-term business housing.
Nudity makes me uncomfortable.
I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.
Erin and I make great use of ours.
No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it's reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. One: You're taking MDMA. Street name, ecstasy. I've done it, and I know the feeling.
You have to cut it out.
That'd be hilarious. Uh, 'Jo, they're creating a hostile work environment. Stop  'em.'
Your wish is my command.
I don't want to say it.
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
Because I am. I need to get her back. [crying] I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?
Okay, why don't we simplify this? Darryl brings it to Michael, Michael brings it to me, no one calls Jo.
I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen.
Fun fact. In France, they call Limitless 'The Man with Many Capabilities.'
I'm such a klutz!
Not here.
Give me one night with you...
Tasteless?
[laughs] Oh no no no no no no. She wouldn't even let me say it. It was adorable. She would plug her ears and scream her heat out.
All right. Uh, Stan, you're up.
The cinema of the unsettling is a growing film movement.  The most well known film in the genre is an hour long shot of a squirrel with diarrhea.
It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some 'Slumdog Millionaire' scenario, where every word she's playing has a connection to her orphan past. It's possible.
Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels?
Number two: no pop culture references.
Michael, this is irresponsible.
Ok.
Did someone say girl talk?
Ohh. Dropping bombs, right? [explosion noise] This really make you think, Michael?
I don't really see what the problem is. Erin doesn't even like sex, remember? You said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton.
First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you'd expect to hear from corporate. Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances.
Ok, did everyone get one? With these bottles, we eliminate the need for plastic water bottles, which are the scourge of the environment.
Yeah, unless somebody else applies today.
Great! [to Jim and Toby] Um, can we just... [does a 'wrap it up' motion with his pen]
Wake up, Fred. The power cord on your Sabre printer shocked you into a coma, and you're dreaming you're a dog on a desert island.'
Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. Kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor. [clapping] All right.
Let's go ahead and wash our hands.
Ok let me go get it.
You're right, we don't need a hat.
[talking on the phone] So I can reprimand them but I can't suspend them. Oh I can't do either. Uh huh. Fair enough.
And what do we have here?
Well, get to work.
Michael! You are making this harder than it has to be.
Just read the letter under your windshield wiper, it explains everything. Quick one. [leans in for a kiss]
Great.
And I overheard, and thought, hey, that'd be fun, don't mind if I do.
Just do it. You were the it that I was just doing.
Uh uh. Corporate stole nothing, okay? Darryl told me, and then I told them, giving Darryl full credit, so... no need to [mimicking Andy] screw corporate! Or anything like that, so. Let's give Darryl a round of applause, as planned. [claps]
Sure. Basically, there's no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem.
[to Toby] I hear them kissing all the time. It's this horrible plipping sound. You know, it's like Chinese water torture. Just...[makes popping sound] like it's coming from my own head.
This is violent and offensive.
How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR?
Hey, guys.
So what, no one's even gonna try?
Actually, that's Nick. He's your new IT guy. Uh, he's setting up a site blocker. Mostly blocking the inappropriate sites.  And then there are the time-wasting sites like Twitter, YouTube. We are blocking those as well.
I have shaved everything...
Wait, wait, you think she invented 'Talla-nasty?' [chuckles] no, no, no, no���
I need to talk to you!
Well, you have a job to do. Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales.
Oh, he is. He's the co-manager, and that's the other co-manager.
What recommendation?
Honestly, it was a little weird.
Butt honking. Yeah, all the honking.
I've got just the thing! [leaves, comes back with a synthesizer] This one's called Earth Rise, on the Moon. [music plays]
At all.
How would we know that, if you don't...
[following Jim and Pam to their car] Guys, to err is human. [trying to block their car]
Yes.  Lars and Decocco���s
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.
Sweetheart.
Okay. So, PDAs. That's gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh...
The Michelin man called, he wants his cummerbund back.
Erin, are you even hearing this?
Number two: You're desperately trying to fit in a whole relationship before Toby comes back from jury duty and Holly has to go back to Nashua. Or three: You're at an age where your sexual climaxes aren't as powerful so you need to overcompensate with foreplay, taboo behavior.
Michael, you just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private?
I technically cannot. I don't have the lung capacity to blow a whistle.
[holding ball in open palm] Oh, yeah, totally.  Jim, you got ripped off big time.
Toby I'm going to tell you her last name tomorrow because she's going to be screaming it tonight.
[laughs] Total brain burp.
Yup. We could watch some right now if you want. I got a Korean film on my iPod if you want to just- if you have the cables.
[to Val] Hey. You're welcome.
Decaf frap-
Oh, how the mediocre have fallen.
Okay, that's not gonna be...
What do you want me to say? I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. [to Jim and Toby] Are we all just gonna pretend to-- okay. [to Kelly] Um, what are your weaknesses?
Yeah, but she's not white, though.
Yes. For Gabe.
Intercepted!
We have a policy here at Sabre where we are, uh, allowed to take two weeks.
- of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, Michael.
What?
CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes.
Hey. I need you to get the paperwork rolling on a new workplace relationship.
Well, uh... why don't you just tell me a little about yourself, Hide.
The Sabre Code of Conduct outlines the governing principles key to establishing and maintaining trust with our employees, clients-
Okay...
I didn't know Darryl joined.
[as Michael and Jo leave] Are you leaving? Oh, am I... should I continue with the investigation?
So, tonight I was thinking, I'm gonna go to the cemetery. I'm gonna drink a little wine and I thought maybe you'd like to come with me.
I love maternity wards. It's the perfect blend of love and horror. Things can go so wrong or so right.
Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?
Seeing as it's Valentine's Day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace.
Yeah.
That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves.
Beautiful sentiment.
I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he's a rat, and I think he's responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,... he broke up the happiest couple in this office!
No, I was not.
The problem, unfortunately, is about the office administrator. I have gone through everything for the past three years. There is nothing that says you are the office administrator.
Ok, well, I bet you can fit 20 little cups of water in your aluminum bottle.
Oh, well I'm still the corporate liaison to the branch.
Okay.
Umm, Pam?
Good. Well, that's the spirit.
Come on.
[to Andy] I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400,000. [smiles] We've investigated. Every time it's been user error.  They block the vents or something, I don't know. That's why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I'd like to reward you for that. [pulls out gift card] That's god for five bucks at Dunkin' Donuts. Any Dunkin' Donuts. [Andy looks over at Darryl and Darryl motions for Andy to go to him]
Those overnight packages needed to go out, and Michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable.
Ok final thing, and this is a fun one: Instead of writing the caption directly under the picture, let's all try using Sticky Quips. All right? New, from Dunder Mifflin Sabre.
Yeah.
Yeah, booby honking. Sure.
It's for protecting my ass. When you suckers lift more than you can handle. Sup, I'm Gabe. Corporate. Continue. Don't be nervous.
This is Michael Scott, co-regional manager of this branch.
[lowers volum] Some of us are trying to have a conversation.
Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV?
Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It's come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or e-mail this around.
So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation?
Whoops.
No... How far away is the Sun?
Shove his sashimi!
320.  Just freeballin' it.
And that goes double for me. I'll stay even later than you'd like.
I still wear Erin's button-downs around the condo sometimes. So it feels to me like we're still in a relationship-
[as Lincoln] I just don't understand. It's 1865, victory is ours, I've saved the very soul of our nation, and yet... happiness eludes me. Oh, perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits.
Oh my God, I can't look at roaches.
Ow! Ow! Stephanie, help!
They say that if you can strengthen your core, it improves your sexual performance. So, you will find me on the Ab-Blaster. And then you will find me blasting...uh, a very nice young woman.
Uh, excuse me, excuse me. How does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming?
There are plenty of people who love touching me. [camera zooms to Ryan, who looks at the camera, extremely skeptical] I'm a terrific hugger. I've been with a bunch of girls where that's basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.
More tasteless than this...'is that a palm tree or did Gabe get skinnier? Either way, let's pee on it.'  [laughter]
Hmm?
Well he���s probably a drug dealer. That���s the best way to land a hot girlfriend. You just uh get her hooked on blow.
Yes, I am.
You know, times were tough. I was unemployed, I was still heart-broken over you, I've lost a good fifty pounds. But as you can see I put all that weight right back on. Feel how fat my buttocks are. Yeah, it's crazy. Touch it. It's like a warm pumpkin.

Corporate says to me, ���Gabe, we need you in Scranton.��� Scranton says, ���Gabe, go back down to Florida. You're needed there.��� So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm up there. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I'm down here. I can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying.
Little cups? Like paper or plastic or... ?
Hey, Andy?
Ok, I'm sorry but I am going to have to shut this down.
Will do... Can I get one of those name plates... that says Gabe Lewis?
Dwight? What are you doing here?
Michael, I don't want to incentivise murder. But - we've tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff -
Maybe you find your own chair.
[walking with Jim and Pam] Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life.
Speed set. One. Two.
Oh boy. Can you get every department head's signature on this so I can back this up to corporate?
[bell dings] Guys, that's the elevator. What if it's him?
