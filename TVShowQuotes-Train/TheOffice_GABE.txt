No. [Robert then nods his head at Jim]
Well... it's an interview, and we don't know that you really have the plan.
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
Oh, well I'm still the corporate liaison to the branch.
So these are your cheeses, your ham, your sausages, your herbs, and your vegetables. Here's what's been done, so start creating. Some times it helps to think of a part of the world, and...
[walking back into the office] That was ugly. I'm sorry you had to see that.
[following Jim and Pam to their car] Guys, to err is human. [trying to block their car]
Pam, I don't want to accuse you of anything. I just want everything to be back the way it's supposed to be. Can you just admit... admit...
You know what? Let me see what I can do.
We are very impressed with this branch and we are so excited about this merger.
How would we know that, if you don't...
I've read- and I don't know anything about this personally- but they say prostate stimulation can help.
The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don't respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I'm the I.T. guy. This Cookie Monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I'm an authority figure.
To Robert California, from the moment you entered our building and our hearts, you...
Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology.
Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim. [Dwight starts to clap] Ok fine. You too Dwight.
[on the phone] You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right. [hangs up]
Ohh. Dropping bombs, right? [explosion noise] This really make you think, Michael?
...I'm sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations.
I don't really see what the problem is. Erin doesn't even like sex, remember? You said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton.
First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you'd expect to hear from corporate. Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances.
I cannot believe that Andy is throwing a party like this just to impress the CEO. Classic Gabe move. Hey Andy, how about you don't steal my business strategies, and I won't dress like my life is just one long brunch?
Yeah. He told me you two broke up.
[holding ball in open palm] Oh, yeah, totally.  Jim, you got ripped off big time.
Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat.
I'll let this slide, but I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you.
Erin, I've been to Japan. I know how to use chopsticks so well. Come back. One night.
Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood. [laughs] Not every day.
Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis.
Too late! Oh. Ha. An IM chat. Very clever. I'll just print that out. Come on guys. Grow up. I don't want to be your babysitter.
Little cups? Like paper or plastic or... ?
Michael, you just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private?
Seeing as it's Valentine's Day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace.
Well, Toby's in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby's done a fine job.
[on voicemail] You've reached Gabe Lewis, I'm currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao. [beep]
Most of our business comes from selling printers. So don't think of yourselves as paper salesmen anymore, but as printer salesmen who also sell paper.
What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. And... you did it. [nods at Andy]
Ok, um, I told the story of your uncle, and I have a feeling that you would have [Michael gesturing behind computer] really been proud of the way... Okay, um...
The alternative is termination. [Michael stares off, considering termination...]
I am as smooth as a porpoise. {Erin argues]
Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a fire, so your appointment got-
Oh, uh, no. No, no, no, no. I'm, uh, I'm actually with a tour group myself, so- [laughter] Hello! I'm Abraham Lincoln! Some people call me the great emancipator, but, uh, you might know me from the penny. [laughter]
Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. It's either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed.
Well he���s probably a drug dealer. That���s the best way to land a hot girlfriend. You just uh get her hooked on blow.
In the future, you need to get Michael's approval on anything before coming to me.
I would also like to toast Robert California. Mr. California,...
Yeah we had a whole conversation about Mondays���
[lowers volum] Some of us are trying to have a conversation.
Why do you keep repeating - [Michael hangs up]
Yeah. But not just bagels. All unwanted problems. Question: What's the most important appliance in your house?
You're really going to like Bill. He, uh, he has me toilet a lot of people for him. [Dwight sighs, Gabe's phone rings] Hallway phone, Gabe Lewis speaking.
There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right?
What kind of music are you into, Peter?
Oh, I don't get that sense at all from you, so...
How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR?
It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some 'Slumdog Millionaire' scenario, where every word she's playing has a connection to her orphan past. It's possible.
Wait, wait, you think she invented 'Talla-nasty?' [chuckles] no, no, no, no���
I'm gonna head back to Siberia there. Ciao. [he and Erin kiss]
Okay, well, obviously if it's a really, really good idea, my door is open.
Very unprofessional, 'Jacques.' Or, should I say, Dwight.
Oh my God, I can't look at roaches.
No. I don't like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?
How many windows are there in New York City?
Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important. [Pam hands Jim a note] It's not about showing you're in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It's about forgiveness. And yes, I'm talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension.
Well, uh... why don't you just tell me a little about yourself, Hide.
Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.
[Andy walks by with DeAngelo, says quietly after he leaves] Walk away bitch.
That's very nice. [referring to Kelly's bindi] I never noticed that before.
Can you two please join me in my office? Now.
I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.
Oh, this is 'Print in All Colors,' Sabre's minority executive training program.
I love maternity wards. It's the perfect blend of love and horror. Things can go so wrong or so right.
You marked severe in all the categories, including at risk for homicidal behavior.
And, uh, you will do your counseling right here, because our HR staff are all certified counselors.
[on videochat]  First let me say that I told them everything you wanted me to say, in just the way you wanted me to say it, so...
Whom I'm seeing is Val from down in the warehouse.
What do you want me to say? I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. [to Jim and Toby] Are we all just gonna pretend to-- okay. [to Kelly] Um, what are your weaknesses?
Umm... 'You don't have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, I'm the only one here.' Ha.
I can see you in the jungle now.
No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it's reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. One: You're taking MDMA. Street name, ecstasy. I've done it, and I know the feeling.
When you're dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like. I wish my gym didn't allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. 'Cause it's policy. See what I mean?
I love the burn. The burn is where I live.
Um. I set my stuff up in there. So...  just give me a few minutes to clean that out for you.
I dominate Valentine's Day. I practically make romance into a science.
It's awful. [reaches for tissue box, hands it to Kevin]
Okay. That's great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else.
I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue.
Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It's come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or e-mail this around.
[makes buzzer sound] Too slow. It's the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential.
Steve Martin. [laughs, then falls] uh, I'm fine. [grunts]
We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so... [nods]
This is just, uh- This American Life, I think I heard it on.
Erin, I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God. [Erin and Angela both look taken aback]
No! We really shouldn't be without a receptionist. Now more than ever.
Well Darryl, considering that I basically own the place, I'm just chillin' at mi casa. This is me, in repose..I suppose.
Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush! [Gabe makes a flushing motion, Dwight twists Gabe's arm] Ow!
Oh? Uh... we haven't started the interview yet. Were you--were you joking?
It's like a hula hoop. Right. Mele Kalikimaka is the wise way.
Uh, I think you���re gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. [chuckles] It���ll be upsetting if you don���t.
Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV?
Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets.
Core���s critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One ��� lengthen. Two ��� elongate.
I'm not technically seeing her, but uh I've seen her, with the eyes and uh there was attraction. In at least one direction. So..[holds up fist]
I will make this sexier than you could ever imagine.
Oh, thank God. I had a horrible nightmare that I was stuck in America with Gabe.'
Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities.
[laughs] Oh no no no no no no. She wouldn't even let me say it. It was adorable. She would plug her ears and scream her heat out.
I still wear Erin's button-downs around the condo sometimes. So it feels to me like we're still in a relationship-
Okay, I-I am, I'm almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. [Robert and Gabe chuckle at this, then Gabe stops chuckling] Do you, um, do you think that you are?
We have a policy here at Sabre where we are, uh, allowed to take two weeks.
And trustworthy in all your business activities and relationships. Treat one another-
You must be pretty horny. [Erin shakes head no]
Good morning. [suitcase falls and he laughs awkwardly]
I've got just the thing! [leaves, comes back with a synthesizer] This one's called Earth Rise, on the Moon. [music plays]
Uh, it's a condo and it's long-term business housing.
Yeah it seems like there isn���t a narrative. [on screen a man gets into a car]  Maybe the filmmaker realized that even narrative is comforting.
That'd be hilarious. Uh, 'Jo, they're creating a hostile work environment. Stop  'em.'
Just do it. You were the it that I was just doing.
Droswip, yeah.  I get it.  Okay, we're gonna get you to the restroom.
So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation?
No! You go away! [storms out, toilet flushes, Jim exits the bathroom]
This wasn't really about Meredith was it. You and Erin are broken up.
Sure. Basically, there's no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem.
More tasteless than this...'is that a palm tree or did Gabe get skinnier? Either way, let's pee on it.'  [laughter]
The cinema of the unsettling is a growing film movement.  The most well known film in the genre is an hour long shot of a squirrel with diarrhea.
Statements of such nature, while they have their place, are overused in a competitive business environment.
[to Cathy] Well, we'll say its eight-two and it'll be our secret.
Hey. I need you to get the paperwork rolling on a new workplace relationship.
Apparently, I bear a passing resemblance to Abraham Lincoln. Makes it kind of hard for me to go to places like museums, historical monuments, elementary schools... I don't see it.
Chelsea's Mom: Chelsea, give Mr. Lincoln your hat so I can take a picture.
Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for.
Actually, that's Nick. He's your new IT guy. Uh, he's setting up a site blocker. Mostly blocking the inappropriate sites.  And then there are the time-wasting sites like Twitter, YouTube. We are blocking those as well.
Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn't this where you fell in love?
[as Lincoln] I just don't understand. It's 1865, victory is ours, I've saved the very soul of our nation, and yet... happiness eludes me. Oh, perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits.
Abe and Mary are seated watching the show. [in Lincoln voice] Oh Mary this is wonderful��� Ok Mary stop your scolding.  I���ll be quiet. [aside to the audience] I need her like I need a hole in the head! [scattered chuckles from the crowd] [Gabe raises his hand with a finger pointed in the shape of a gun to his head] BANG!  Ooh [Gabe falls to the ground and the crowd claps, Gabe picks up the Lincoln hat, bows, runs to the crowd and trades it back for his pink ���DM does GB��� hat and runs off]
Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again?
First thing's first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would've just looped back to me, so, it's cool you recognized my role here.
I technically cannot. I don't have the lung capacity to blow a whistle.
I picked out our movie. It's called 'Suspiria'. It pushes all the boundaries. All your preconceived notions about what horror can be come crashing down.
I'm back! Ha ha. Pam, perfect. I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem.
Those overnight packages needed to go out, and Michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable.
That is Jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office.
Over here is Meredith Palmer and Creed Bratton.
Can I buy everyone coffees? [everyone shakes their heads] [in Cookie Monster voice] 'Or cookies.'
Oh, Jo. Jo, I'm disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was...
I don't wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad.
It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened.
Hey Darryl, I was thinking, uh, maybe while we read through this, uh, you could grab us all some coffee. My treat. It's a hundred dollar bill. Should cover it I think. Don't bring me any of that caramel soy latte crap, ok? I want a decaf frappuccino. Val���
Ok, well, I bet you can fit 20 little cups of water in your aluminum bottle.
Yeah. I don't want to be offensive but, uh... may I ask you what that means?
It's for protecting my ass. When you suckers lift more than you can handle. Sup, I'm Gabe. Corporate. Continue. Don't be nervous.
[laughs, eventually Erin joins him laughing] Oh that would be scary!
[as Michael and Jo leave] Are you leaving? Oh, am I... should I continue with the investigation?
Oh, is it okay with you? Because if it's not, you work for me, so... Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and contracts governing our business. Be honest, fair-
Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe.
Why don't we say ciao to the impressions? [everyone says ciao]
The Sabre Code of Conduct outlines the governing principles key to establishing and maintaining trust with our employees, clients-
I can't believe I didn't think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel! Why are you talking to Stanley's mistress?
I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.
Oh, he is. He's the co-manager, and that's the other co-manager.
My gym allows it. I wish they didn't, but it's policy. So I respect it, and I just--[put's his hands cupped by his face and turns away] keep a low--you know, I look away. Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room.
Okay. We're going to table the hat question. The best ideas are going to come to me, I make the final decision, period.
But you do. You are in charge -
Darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He's gone.
Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?
Okay, why don't we simplify this? Darryl brings it to Michael, Michael brings it to me, no one calls Jo.
Darn it Bob. I told you not to buy a Sabre brand lifeboat.' [laughter]
Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics.
Well, that's actually what I came to talk to you about. I know how much you want to watch 'Wall-e'.
You know, times were tough. I was unemployed, I was still heart-broken over you, I've lost a good fifty pounds. But as you can see I put all that weight right back on. Feel how fat my buttocks are. Yeah, it's crazy. Touch it. It's like a warm pumpkin.
I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out. You said, and I quote, 'My good sir! Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand.' I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way.
Um, hi, uh, my name is Gabe Lewis. I am coordinating director for merging regions.
You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the gang.
They're going to be pretty pleased in Tallahassee that I snagged an Indian for the program. She'll be the first. The program's mostly black. It's almost too black. That didn't sound right.
When our warehouse workers make deliveries, they're going to be encouraged to offer clients extra products. And then they will split those commissions with sales.
[on phone] Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out.
Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk.
Whoa! That's a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.
Just read the letter under your windshield wiper, it explains everything. Quick one. [leans in for a kiss]
Well, I wish that I could do something, but it's kind of policy, you know? Above my pay grade. You know?
We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that.
Michael! You are making this harder than it has to be.
Okay, while this is interesting we should get back to work. These stand-offs can last a long time. What if it's another Waco.
You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate. A two-week training program at the Yale school of management, obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities.
[sees Andy walk into the Men's Room and follows him in] Stay away from Erin! [cornering him in the bathroom]
Well... it's just... [ringing] it messes up my rhythm.
Erin and I make great use of ours.
Michael, I don't want to incentivise murder. But - we've tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff -
Well, it's nine miles away. I'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf.
So, tonight I was thinking, I'm gonna go to the cemetery. I'm gonna drink a little wine and I thought maybe you'd like to come with me.
Yup. We could watch some right now if you want. I got a Korean film on my iPod if you want to just- if you have the cables.
Will do... Can I get one of those name plates... that says Gabe Lewis?
I don't know. All I know is the building.
Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. Kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor. [clapping] All right.
I know what it smells like but I didn't roll in anything. It's from listening to all of Gabe's bull[bleep]. [laughter] 'Isn't this the perfect romantic getaway, Erin? Sitting on a deserted island wearing dog costumes? I'm Gabe and I'm a weirdo.'
So I got us a compromise. This movie's called 'Hardware'. It tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like Wall-e, that the government invented to destroy humans. It's some of what you like and some of what I like, and... married...
How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability. [makes a 'zero' hand gesture]
Oh, close. It's a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck.
- of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, Michael.
Fun fact. In France, they call Limitless 'The Man with Many Capabilities.'
That is not how it seems to me.
Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we're still dating?
Ok. Ok there. I heard that. So I'm sorry, Pam, but that's it. I'm going to have to suspend you without pay for two days.
I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who don't get the reference, making them feel like the other.
Ok, did everyone get one? With these bottles, we eliminate the need for plastic water bottles, which are the scourge of the environment.
No, not nice. Terrible. Doesn't even include the fact that they're dogs.
Well, you have a job to do. Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales.
Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the shortlist for next time there's an opening.
No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying.
Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview.
[to Andy] I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400,000. [smiles] We've investigated. Every time it's been user error.  They block the vents or something, I don't know. That's why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I'd like to reward you for that. [pulls out gift card] That's god for five bucks at Dunkin' Donuts. Any Dunkin' Donuts. [Andy looks over at Darryl and Darryl motions for Andy to go to him]
They don't make these cords in boot cut anymore!
[stands up and walks to stage, takes the microphone] Well, this is embarrassing, um, I'm obviously really angry at Erin. It's that quarter life crisis everyone's been talking about. [Jim is looking wide eyed, jaw dropped] Alright I'm gonna go. [Dwight plays cricket noises]
I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They���d flex them all night at the discotheque.
CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes.
And I overheard, and thought, hey, that'd be fun, don't mind if I do.
You never know with Jo. Sometimes we're here til midnight. Sometimes she doesn't show up for three days.
Okay, you know what, you don't need to make that sound.
Gabe's mom... hmm... Gabe's mom? Wait. Tall woman? Looks like Gabe? Yeah, I banged her.'
At Sabre, we really encourage honest communication. You should always feel free to express your thoughts, your -
Number two: You're desperately trying to fit in a whole relationship before Toby comes back from jury duty and Holly has to go back to Nashua. Or three: You're at an age where your sexual climaxes aren't as powerful so you need to overcompensate with foreplay, taboo behavior.
I get it. Andy's slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam.
Corporate wants me up here, Dunder Mifflin wants me down there. What they worked out is that Monday, Wednesday and Friday I'm here in Scranton, Tuesday Thursday I'm in Tallahassee, I mean I feel like Vera Farmiga in Up in the Air, you know? More money more problems. Although, I didn't get a raise, so you know. Same money, more problems.
Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I���m pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines.
That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves.
Uh uh. Corporate stole nothing, okay? Darryl told me, and then I told them, giving Darryl full credit, so... no need to [mimicking Andy] screw corporate! Or anything like that, so. Let's give Darryl a round of applause, as planned. [claps]
Really? All kinds? So you like songs of hate written by the white knights of the Ku Klux Klan?
Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy.
There are plenty of people who love touching me. [camera zooms to Ryan, who looks at the camera, extremely skeptical] I'm a terrific hugger. I've been with a bunch of girls where that's basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.
Ok, but once this starts, it's going to be moving fast. It's going to be hot and heavy and I don't want a bunch of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around my jock. You know?
My entire childhood, I was the one left out, and I said to myself: Gabe, if you just achieve some success, you'll be part of them. You'll be part of the happy ones. But instead, people just used my success as a new way to shut me out.
This is Michael Scott, co-regional manager of this branch.
Well, that's gonna be tough, because we're getting a dunking clinic from Magic Jordan himself.
We just want to say how grateful we are.
No, I'm gonna stand where I want. Okay? You don't wanna get on my bad side! I've seen some horrible things! I own over two hundred horror movies!
Uh, excuse me, excuse me. How does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming?
I don't know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah.
You know, there's this expression: Bro's before Ho's. And what that's short for is brothers before whores. Uh, I don't buy that. I would throw any brother under the bus for any whore. Woman.
Yeah, that would be awesome. I could get a girlfriend. Wouldn't have to go to Amsterdam seven times a year. But uh, I'm young, right?  I will date when I'm dead! [Laughs]
Wake up, Fred. The power cord on your Sabre printer shocked you into a coma, and you're dreaming you're a dog on a desert island.'
I started dating Erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite.
Corporate says to me, ���Gabe, we need you in Scranton.��� Scranton says, ���Gabe, go back down to Florida. You're needed there.��� So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm up there. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I'm down here. I can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying.
They don't touch. They don't kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife.
The problem, unfortunately, is about the office administrator. I have gone through everything for the past three years. There is nothing that says you are the office administrator.
Because I am. I need to get her back. [crying] I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?
I get the sense that Val enjoys a good putdown. Considering that's the only thing I know about her. I will be milking that hard. [Gestures milking a cow]
I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen.
