I can't take it anymore, Stan. My cousin's been here for two weeks and he's driving me insane.
Kyle, we told you: Kids in Colorado all play hide and seek at the airport.
How far do you think it is to Connecticut?
But you can't make fun of him AT ALL. No smartass comments, nothin'.
Remember: Just hold on. No matter how long the sledding run lasts, hold on.
I'm just throwin' it out there as a possibility. 
You did, too! You are so full of crap!
I just have to face facts that I'm goin' to live with my crappy cousin forever.
I don't know, Mom. Last time I saw him he was sledding.
What about Cartman, huh? He rips on me for being Jewish! He's gonna tear this kid apart!
Wait. Kyle, this may sound crazy, but I think you should stay!
I dunno, Mom. It's like he vanished into thin air.
Do you promise??  I mean, oh. Thah-uh that's too bad, dude. What, what changed for you?
No. I tried getting my cousin lost in the woods, but a stupid bear brought him home.
Cartman, no Jew jokes! All you have to do is keep your mouth shut, and you've got forty bucks! Can you do it? 
Ungh, this is taking too long. The flight to Connecticut is about to leave.  Ey! Can we speed things up here??
Kyle, this is Cartman, my sort of... friend-ish.
You know, it's just possible he went back to Connecticut.
Yeah, but like... first cousin or distant cousin?
Well, ah I mean, maybe he got so worried about his mom that found a way to get back and see her.
I already checked the playground, Ma.  I told you, he isn't really- 
Okay. See ya, cousin. Hope to see ya soon.  Not too soon, I hope.
Look, ih it's not because anything's wrong with you.
Nonono, it was good! What were you going to say?
Yeah. You see, I've learned something today.  Sometimes people have trouble fitting in at, at school and,...  and um... Let's see, what did I learn about?  What did I learn about today?
I spent five years in this town making a good name for Jews and this... this... stereotype shows up and wrecks it all! You know what my biggest fear is? That I'll become him. That somehow his mannerisms will start rubbing off on me, and I'll become a stereotype. I mean, I'm a Jew and he's making me hate Jews.
Look, Kyle. Sledding is something all kids out here do. You've gotta learn.
That kid over there is my cousin from the East Coast. He's having a really hard time right now, so I'm going to offer you forty dollars to not rip on him.
And you especially can't say anything about Jews!
What? How the hell am I supposed to do that?
You need to learn to play some sports, Kyle. So we're gonna start with a tough one called, "Catch the Ball." I throw the football to you; you throw it back to me.
Dude, we're the only ones here! How long does it take five people through security?!
Ih it's a football, dude. You just- put your arms out and catch it.  Alright, here we go.
