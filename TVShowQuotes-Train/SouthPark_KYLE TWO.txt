Well what do you mean?  What room is he sleeping in?
Well, ah I mean, maybe he got so worried about his mom that found a way to get back and see her.
Dude, we're the only ones here! How long does it take five people through security?!
You did, too! You are so full of crap!
What about Cartman, huh? He rips on me for being Jewish! He's gonna tear this kid apart!
And you especially can't say anything about Jews!
Look, Kyle. Sledding is something all kids out here do. You've gotta learn.
Yeah. You see, I've learned something today.  Sometimes people have trouble fitting in at, at school and,...  and um... Let's see, what did I learn about?  What did I learn about today?
Wait. Kyle, this may sound crazy, but I think you should stay!
No. I tried getting my cousin lost in the woods, but a stupid bear brought him home.
I already checked the playground, Ma.  I told you, he isn't really- 
Cartman, no Jew jokes! All you have to do is keep your mouth shut, and you've got forty bucks! Can you do it? 
I don't know, Mom. Last time I saw him he was sledding.
What? How the hell am I supposed to do that?
I spent five years in this town making a good name for Jews and this... this... stereotype shows up and wrecks it all! You know what my biggest fear is? That I'll become him. That somehow his mannerisms will start rubbing off on me, and I'll become a stereotype. I mean, I'm a Jew and he's making me hate Jews.
I just have to face facts that I'm goin' to live with my crappy cousin forever.
Ih it's a football, dude. You just- put your arms out and catch it.  Alright, here we go. 
Do you promise??  I mean, oh. Thah-uh that's too bad, dude. What, what changed for you?
Remember: Just hold on. No matter how long the sledding run lasts, hold on.
How far do you think it is to Connecticut?
Kyle, we told you: Kids in Colorado all play hide and seek at the airport.
Yeah, but like... first cousin or distant cousin?
Kyle, this is Cartman, my sort of... friend-ish.
Ungh, this is taking too long. The flight to Connecticut is about to leave.  Ey! Can we speed things up here??
Nonono, it was good! What were you going to say?
I'm just throwin' it out there as a possibility. 
Look, ih it's not because anything's wrong with you.
Mom's special stew. She makes it every Monday and I love it.
Okay. See ya, cousin. Hope to see ya soon.  Not too soon, I hope.
You need to learn to play some sports, Kyle. So we're gonna start with a tough one called, "Catch the Ball." I throw the football to you; you throw it back to me.
You know, it's just possible he went back to Connecticut.
That kid over there is my cousin from the East Coast. He's having a really hard time right now, so I'm going to offer you forty dollars to not rip on him.
But you can't make fun of him AT ALL. No smartass comments, nothin'.
