I dunno, Mom. It's like he vanished into thin air.

Now throw it back to me.

I don't know, Mom. Last time I saw him he was sledding.

No!

...So dig it out.

Alright. 

Mom's special stew. She makes it every Monday and I love it.

Look, Kyle. Sledding is something all kids out here do. You've gotta learn.

Cool. 

Do you promise??  I mean, oh. Thah-uh that's too bad, dude. What, what changed for you?

You know, it's just possible he went back to Connecticut.

No. I tried getting my cousin lost in the woods, but a stupid bear brought him home.

I'm just throwin' it out there as a possibility. 

This is ridiculous! Come on! 

Nonono, it was good! What were you going to say?

What about Cartman, huh? He rips on me for being Jewish! He's gonna tear this kid apart!

JUST GET IN THE BOX!

Kyle, this is Cartman, my sort of... friend-ish.

How am I related to him again?

I don't know, dude.

Well, ah I mean, maybe he got so worried about his mom that found a way to get back and see her.

Cartman, I need to talk to you. 

Ungh, this is taking too long. The flight to Connecticut is about to leave.  Ey! Can we speed things up here??

I can't take it anymore, Stan. My cousin's been here for two weeks and he's driving me insane.

Dudedudedude! You- you have five million dollars??

Okay. 

Think he'll be alright?

Yeah, dude, it's great! 

Remember: Just hold on. No matter how long the sledding run lasts, hold on.

Oh no- don't worry about it, dude.

What? How the hell am I supposed to do that?

I spent five years in this town making a good name for Jews and this... this... stereotype shows up and wrecks it all! You know what my biggest fear is? That I'll become him. That somehow his mannerisms will start rubbing off on me, and I'll become a stereotype. I mean, I'm a Jew and he's making me hate Jews.

Ih it's a football, dude. You just- put your arms out and catch it.  Alright, here we go. 

...What?

AAA!

...Hm, that was pretty gay. 

Look, ih it's not because anything's wrong with you.

Ya see?

Oh my God.

You did, too! You are so full of crap!

That kid over there is my cousin from the East Coast. He's having a really hard time right now, so I'm going to offer you forty dollars to not rip on him.

... Uhwhat?

Uh-uh-uh oh, dude. Uh 

Kyle, we told you: Kids in Colorado all play hide and seek at the airport.

Oh my God.

Okay, Cartman, you're it. Start counting. 

Well what do you mean?  What room is he sleeping in?

It's fine!

Wait. Kyle, this may sound crazy, but I think you should stay!

I just have to face facts that I'm goin' to live with my crappy cousin forever.

Nuh-uh, I knew you were gonna make fun of my lame cousin, so I paid you the forty bucks NOT to rip on him! You ripped on him, deal's off!

What?

So we have the same blood?

Yeah. You see, I've learned something today.  Sometimes people have trouble fitting in at, at school and,...  and um... Let's see, what did I learn about?  What did I learn about today?

You need to learn to play some sports, Kyle. So we're gonna start with a tough one called, "Catch the Ball." I throw the football to you; you throw it back to me.

Here, Kyle. You go hide in here. 

I hope he doesn't suffocate.

Okay. See ya, cousin. Hope to see ya soon.  Not too soon, I hope.

GAAAH! 

Ugh.

CARTMAN!

What?

Dude! Weak.

Yeah! They WERE, Cartman!

Mom?

Oh no.

I don't think so.

Cartman, no Jew jokes! All you have to do is keep your mouth shut, and you've got forty bucks! Can you do it? 

A, a bus. R-really?

You blew the deal, Cartman!

And you especially can't say anything about Jews!

...Well, then we'll dry them off!
