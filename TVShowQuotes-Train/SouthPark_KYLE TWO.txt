I spent five years in this town making a good name for Jews and this... this... stereotype shows up and wrecks it all! You know what my biggest fear is? That I'll become him. That somehow his mannerisms will start rubbing off on me, and I'll become a stereotype. I mean, I'm a Jew and he's making me hate Jews.

Look, Kyle. Sledding is something all kids out here do. You've gotta learn.

Yeah. You see, I've learned something today.  Sometimes people have trouble fitting in at, at school and,...  and um... Let's see, what did I learn about?  What did I learn about today?

Okay. See ya, cousin. Hope to see ya soon.  Not too soon, I hope.

That kid over there is my cousin from the East Coast. He's having a really hard time right now, so I'm going to offer you forty dollars to not rip on him.

Cartman, no Jew jokes! All you have to do is keep your mouth shut, and you've got forty bucks! Can you do it? 

I dunno, Mom. It's like he vanished into thin air.

Well what do you mean?  What room is he sleeping in?

Ih it's a football, dude. You just- put your arms out and catch it.  Alright, here we go. 

Wait. Kyle, this may sound crazy, but I think you should stay!

You did, too! You are so full of crap!

Nonono, it was good! What were you going to say?

Remember: Just hold on. No matter how long the sledding run lasts, hold on.

You know, it's just possible he went back to Connecticut.

How far do you think it is to Connecticut?

I already checked the playground, Ma.  I told you, he isn't really- 

Look, ih it's not because anything's wrong with you.

What about Cartman, huh? He rips on me for being Jewish! He's gonna tear this kid apart!

I'm just throwin' it out there as a possibility. 

Kyle, we told you: Kids in Colorado all play hide and seek at the airport.

And you especially can't say anything about Jews!

No. I tried getting my cousin lost in the woods, but a stupid bear brought him home.

I don't know, Mom. Last time I saw him he was sledding.

I can't take it anymore, Stan. My cousin's been here for two weeks and he's driving me insane.

Ungh, this is taking too long. The flight to Connecticut is about to leave.  Ey! Can we speed things up here??

I just have to face facts that I'm goin' to live with my crappy cousin forever.

Dude, we're the only ones here! How long does it take five people through security?!

Mom's special stew. She makes it every Monday and I love it.

What? How the hell am I supposed to do that?

Do you promise??  I mean, oh. Thah-uh that's too bad, dude. What, what changed for you?

Yeah, but like... first cousin or distant cousin?

Well, ah I mean, maybe he got so worried about his mom that found a way to get back and see her.

Nuh-uh, I knew you were gonna make fun of my lame cousin, so I paid you the forty bucks NOT to rip on him! You ripped on him, deal's off!
