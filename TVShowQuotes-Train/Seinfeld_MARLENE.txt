You sure you want to talk about this? Cause I sure dont.
Well, to be honest, it just didnt make it for me. Its just so much fluff.
Well, nothing. Its no skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didnt see what the big attraction was.
...so, it mustve been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyones just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old jeans and t-shirt. And I dont know, I was just in one of those moods. So I said to myself, Marlene, just do it. And I jumped in. And as Im getting out, I feel all these eyes on me, and I look up and everyone is just staring at me.
Look, Jerry, its just wasn't my kind of humor.
Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I dont see each other anymore, it doesnt mean we shouldnt stay friends.
Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night.
Good enough. Im really glad we got that settled.
I cant be with someone if I dont respect what they do.
(from the phone) Jerry, have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If Im not talking into the soap right now, call me back.
