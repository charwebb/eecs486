Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I dont see each other anymore, it doesnt mean we shouldnt stay friends.
I cant be with someone if I dont respect what they do.
(from the phone) Jerry, have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If Im not talking into the soap right now, call me back.
...so, it mustve been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyones just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old jeans and t-shirt. And I dont know, I was just in one of those moods. So I said to myself, Marlene, just do it. And I jumped in. And as Im getting out, I feel all these eyes on me, and I look up and everyone is just staring at me.
Good enough. Im really glad we got that settled.
Im sorry, Jerry. I just dont think this is gonna work.
Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night.
Look, Jerry, its just wasn't my kind of humor.
You sure you want to talk about this? Cause I sure dont.
Well, to be honest, it just didnt make it for me. Its just so much fluff.
