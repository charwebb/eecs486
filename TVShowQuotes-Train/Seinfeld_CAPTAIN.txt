Ladies and gentlemen, our flight time, with stopovers, will be approximately 22 hours.
What are you doing, Kramer?! You're all over the road!
Kramer?! What the hell are you doing back there?
Latham, Massachusetts. Why don't you take a cab into town, get yourself something to eat. I got your beeper number - I'll beep you as soon as we're ready.
I'm Captain Maddox this is my co-pilot, Kurt Adams. Ready to go to Paris?
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Due to equipment problems at the runway at Laguardia, we've been instructed by the tower to re-route and land at JFK. We apologize for any inconvenience...
Kramer, get the hell off of there. You're not trained to operate this equipment!
Well, again, sorry about that little mishap. But once you get everything checked out there shouldn't be anymore problems.
Don't worry about that. We'll take care of them for you.
Well, Mr. Kramer, your list of short cuts is most impressive.
