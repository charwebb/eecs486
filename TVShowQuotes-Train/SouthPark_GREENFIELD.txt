Alright, not bad. Let's keep him on the top pile. Next!
Uuuhh, it's only been like, four hours. Aren't you resorting to cannibalism a little quickly?
Great! We'll get started with auditions immediately. What part should we cast first?
We just want to do a recreation of the story for our show. Then we'll flash a number on the screen that people can call if they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter. That's it. You win, we win, America wins.
What? Christ, are you people diabetic or something?
Sure. This story has everything. People. Furniture. Talking-ih it's a real American story.
Whoa. Talk about "all washed-up", huh? Great to have you, Eric!  Here we go, aaand action.
Well- who the hell made you the boss anyway?
Perfect! You got it! Let's move on to the Chefs! 
My name is Sid Greenfield. I'm the director from Los Angeles for America's Most Wanted.
God, I hate mountains.  This better not push back our shooting schedule.  Okay, people, let's rehearse the reenactment from the top before we shoot it.  Who's that?
Oh, thank you very much. We'll get back to you.  I think I've seen enough genetic engineers. Let's move on to the auditions for the part of Misteruhh Garrison.
Don't worry, Mayor. America's Most Wanted is not about violence, it's about family.
Somebody go see why we lost the hookup! 
What the--? Bu-eh. Eric Roberts is improvising lines again!
How can we? How could we live with ourselves?
Now, wait a minute. We all had a big breakfast: can't you people go without eating for a little while?
