Sure. This story has everything. People. Furniture. Talking-ih it's a real American story.
We just want to do a recreation of the story for our show. Then we'll flash a number on the screen that people can call if they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter. That's it. You win, we win, America wins.
Well- who the hell made you the boss anyway?
Don't worry, Mayor. America's Most Wanted is not about violence, it's about family.
What? Christ, are you people diabetic or something?
Perfect! You got it! Let's move on to the Chefs! 
Somebody go see why we lost the hookup! 
Great! We'll get started with auditions immediately. What part should we cast first?
My name is Sid Greenfield. I'm the director from Los Angeles for America's Most Wanted.
Alright, not bad. Let's keep him on the top pile. Next!
God, I hate mountains.  This better not push back our shooting schedule.  Okay, people, let's rehearse the reenactment from the top before we shoot it.  Who's that?
Oh, thank you very much. We'll get back to you.  I think I've seen enough genetic engineers. Let's move on to the auditions for the part of Misteruhh Garrison.
Uuuhh, it's only been like, four hours. Aren't you resorting to cannibalism a little quickly?
Whoa. Talk about "all washed-up", huh? Great to have you, Eric!  Here we go, aaand action.
Now, wait a minute. We all had a big breakfast: can't you people go without eating for a little while?
How can we? How could we live with ourselves?
We're desperate for stories.  A-and this one is so compelling.
