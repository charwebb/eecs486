Well, I mean, it's obvious all the talent and artistic vision in the band comes from you. Strange, how everyone focuses n Timmy, idn't it? I mean, even the name of the band is "Timmy,"
I just wanted to tell you that, well, I think that you're a great guitar player and song writer.
Society has to learn how to be more compassionate! This is gonna stop if I have to stop it myself!
That should just about put an end to all this Timmy nonsense. 
I know. I'd like to sing the complex and amazing song that won me the Oscar, a song entitled, "You'll Be In... Me."  Thanks.You're inside of me.Deep inside of me. So deep inside, I can feel you pushing against my heart.
Last night I went, "O!"BubudioLast night I went "Bubudio"
Well, I mean, why are you lettin' 'em do this to your son? Don't you see that everyone's just laughin' at him?
Look, I used to be in a band, too. Genesis. And all those bastards did was hold me back and hold me back. But then, finally, I went solo. And that's when I started writing really great songs. But look, if you happen to be on the sidelines, you know, bein' more of a cheerleader than a player, well, then I guess you should stay on as Timmy's shadow.
Well, I think the sad question is, "Where are the parents in all this?" I mean, that kid's parents are lettin' him be exploited, and they don't even seem to care.
It's too bad those other guys are holdin' you back.
