I'M NOT A DOUCHE! And I challenge you to a psychic showdown! I'll prove to the world that I'm psychic and you're not!

Okay okay, and she-she's she died?

Thank you, thank you.

Look, people have the right to be skeptical. I really hear voices in my head.

I think I've had of your bullying me! Get out of my house or I'll runs upstairs, lock myself in my panic room and call the police!

Kenny says hi.

I'm not a douche 

Uh d'eh'hm quiet, quiet down boys. It doesn't work that way. Uh, okay, I I'm getting ...someone now whose name is g-, a t-. It's an l-, it's a m-, it's k-.

Oh.  The John Edward show is not liable for opinions and materials given for entertainment purposes only. 

Everything I tell people is positive and gives them hope! How does that make me a douche?!

Why that... that's me!

Okay, now I'm getting that Kenny ...died?

Maybe it is for real.

Doesn't work that way.  Now, Kenny is telling me that... you're his best friends, and he's in a ss-safe place.

Thank you.  Alright, asshole! I know you're here to try to throw me off, so go ahead. Give my your best shot!

Okay now Harry. He's telling me... oh well, he's saying that you two used to... do things.

But I do have a special power! I know I do!

Thank you, thank you. Alright let's get started.  'S coming from over here. 'S the name Mike mean anything to anybody?  I'm getting um, I'm getting M-mike? Definitely an M, d'um, maybe Matt? Mike? Matt? Mi-mmm, Mi-Mike, m-Mary?

Uh no, come on now! 

But I'm a psychic.

What?!

And that those things involved... stuff?

Oh now she's sending me a P word. Maybe it's a puh-? Or a huh-?

Wah-why?

God-damnit, I'm special!! 

Look, what I do doesn't hurt anybody. I give people closure and help them cope with life.

So, you think you can talk to dead people better than me, huh?!

They told me your show is getting better ratings than mine, that you're saying I'm a fraud on your show! You'd better not ever call me a liar, or a fake, or a douche again, or else I'll sue you for slander!

She says there was something she asked you to do, and you're not doing it? She wants you to look for four white doves.

No, wait! I'm not a douche! I make people feel good about themselves!  I give people resolution! 

Okay, and she's telling me there's something about... the money. That the, the money is safe? Is that making sense? 

Oh right. And uh, did an older woman pass, she's asking for Kyle? Maybe a grandma?

Must be from somewhere else in the audience, then. Uh, d'uh, money? Is someone el-

Well, thank you very much! 

Oh, it's comin' from over here.  I'm getting all kinds of voices today.  Woo! 

Ohh, there's somebody with him. Who's Kyle?
