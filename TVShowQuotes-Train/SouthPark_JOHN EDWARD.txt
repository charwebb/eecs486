Well, thank you very much! 

Look, people have the right to be skeptical. I really hear voices in my head.

What?!

Kenny says hi.

Everything I tell people is positive and gives them hope! How does that make me a douche?!

I'M NOT A DOUCHE! And I challenge you to a psychic showdown! I'll prove to the world that I'm psychic and you're not!

Oh now she's sending me a P word. Maybe it's a puh-? Or a huh-?

But I'm a psychic.

Thank you.  Alright, asshole! I know you're here to try to throw me off, so go ahead. Give my your best shot!

Okay, now I'm getting that Kenny ...died?

I'm not a douche 

Why that... that's me!

And that those things involved... stuff?

Oh right. And uh, did an older woman pass, she's asking for Kyle? Maybe a grandma?

I'm not a douche!

Look, what I do doesn't hurt anybody. I give people closure and help them cope with life.

I think I've had of your bullying me! Get out of my house or I'll runs upstairs, lock myself in my panic room and call the police!

Okay, and she's telling me there's something about... the money. That the, the money is safe? Is that making sense? 

Thank you, thank you. Alright let's get started.  'S coming from over here. 'S the name Mike mean anything to anybody?  I'm getting um, I'm getting M-mike? Definitely an M, d'um, maybe Matt? Mike? Matt? Mi-mmm, Mi-Mike, m-Mary?

So, you think you can talk to dead people better than me, huh?!

Uh no, come on now! 

Okay okay, and she-she's she died?

Okay now Harry. He's telling me... oh well, he's saying that you two used to... do things.

Maybe it is for real.

Doesn't work that way.  Now, Kenny is telling me that... you're his best friends, and he's in a ss-safe place.

Thank you, thank you.

Oh.  The John Edward show is not liable for opinions and materials given for entertainment purposes only. 

They told me your show is getting better ratings than mine, that you're saying I'm a fraud on your show! You'd better not ever call me a liar, or a fake, or a douche again, or else I'll sue you for slander!

But I do have a special power! I know I do!

Wah-why?

And, and this wasn't, this wasn't a good death. It was like a, it was a sad death. It was like a, it was like a death that made people sad. Does that make sense?

No, wait! I'm not a douche! I make people feel good about themselves!  I give people resolution! 

God-damnit, I'm special!! 

Ohh, there's somebody with him. Who's Kyle?

Oh, it's comin' from over here.  I'm getting all kinds of voices today.  Woo! 

I'm not a douche! What if I really believe that dead people talk to me?
