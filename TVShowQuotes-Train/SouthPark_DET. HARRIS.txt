Okay! Okay. Okay. Hold on.  Okay, go ahead.

Let's cut the crap, huh? We know there's an illegal cock Magic ring going on in town, we just wanna know who's leading it.

Who paid you to call us and take our focus away from the investigation?! What color were they?!

Oh, it's a new one.  Aw, shit! Look out! 

As long as Adams only choked the black half, I think it's okay.

He's not a Native American, damnit! That's obvious!

Uh huh, go ahead.

Okay, okay, so we're agreeing the hologram is black. So the question is, if he's black, then how come we couldn't choke him?

Oh, I get it now. Do you know what the penalty is for calling in a false cock Magic report?

Yeah? Wait. Mitchell, listen to this one.  Start over: what's the setup?

All right, listen up! We believe this is where the black people are! They're holograms, so we can't choke them or shoot them, so stand by till we figure out what the hell to do!

Freeze!  Well, well! Looks like I finally caught the big boys! You're all going to jail for a long time!  Especially you, scumbag!

Do you have any sympathy at all for the animals, Mr. McCormick? Can you imagine being kept in a small cage, barely able to turn around, and then finally let out only to be blasted by Arctic ice spells and legendary creature cards? It's illegal, and it's wrong. And anyone I find involved with this filth is going down!

I'll volunteer.

Agreed! Who first called 911? 

Mr. Marsh, forgive me if I say your story sounds a little farfetched. You're saying that these people who what you killed are entertainment producers?

Oh my God. Are you sure that hologram is black??

Right. Roosters are being forced against their will to play "Magic: the Gathering," and you know nothing about it because you're 'white'. Let's git something straight: cock Magic isn't an Asian thing or a Mexican thing. White people do it too, if they're poor enough. You got a junked car in your front yard, Mr. McCormick. Care to tell us where the cock Magic fights are being held?

Alright alright, let's focus. What kind of decks were they using?

Yehah? Hang on! Mitch!  Two black guys in the upstairs of the house. One of them is threatening the other one.  Okay, go ahead.

Uh huh. And what about the cock Magic? Where was that? 

Hello, Mr. McCormick. Surprised to see us?

You're Lorde.

What is it, Adams?

That isn't even close! We have to be able to prove that hologram is a light-skinned black guy!

Heh, uh huh? 

Did you shoot him?

We know we can't, but we're trying to! Jesus, tell them we're workiing on it!

So what's the problem?

Oh God! Stop! Stop! Stop!

Did you choke him?

What?! We're not racists.

We saw your fliers.  "Panda Express. Cock Magic at 9 pm."
