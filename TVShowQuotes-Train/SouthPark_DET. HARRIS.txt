What is it, Adams?

What?! We're not racists.

Oh God! Stop! Stop! Stop!

All right, listen up! We believe this is where the black people are! They're holograms, so we can't choke them or shoot them, so stand by till we figure out what the hell to do!

Did you shoot him?

Hello, Mr. McCormick. Surprised to see us?

He's not a Native American, damnit! That's obvious!

Shoot him!

Let's cut the crap, huh? We know there's an illegal cock Magic ring going on in town, we just wanna know who's leading it.

Yehah? Hang on! Mitch!  Two black guys in the upstairs of the house. One of them is threatening the other one.  Okay, go ahead.

Oh, it's a new one.  Aw, shit! Look out! 

Alright alright, let's focus. What kind of decks were they using?

I'll volunteer.

Okay! Okay. Okay. Hold on.  Okay, go ahead.

Okay! Okay, okay okay okay. Go ahead.

Oh, I get it now. Do you know what the penalty is for calling in a false cock Magic report?

Oh my God. Are you sure that hologram is black??

Uh huh, go ahead.

Right. Roosters are being forced against their will to play "Magic: the Gathering," and you know nothing about it because you're 'white'. Let's git something straight: cock Magic isn't an Asian thing or a Mexican thing. White people do it too, if they're poor enough. You got a junked car in your front yard, Mr. McCormick. Care to tell us where the cock Magic fights are being held?

Okay, okay, so we're agreeing the hologram is black. So the question is, if he's black, then how come we couldn't choke him?

So what's the problem?

Uh huh. And what about the cock Magic? Where was that? 

Did you choke him?

Agreed! Who first called 911? 

I'm Detective Harris, South Park Police.

Do you have any sympathy at all for the animals, Mr. McCormick? Can you imagine being kept in a small cage, barely able to turn around, and then finally let out only to be blasted by Arctic ice spells and legendary creature cards? It's illegal, and it's wrong. And anyone I find involved with this filth is going down!

Mr. Marsh, forgive me if I say your story sounds a little farfetched. You're saying that these people who what you killed are entertainment producers?

Yeah? Wait. Mitchell, listen to this one.  Start over: what's the setup?

That isn't even close! We have to be able to prove that hologram is a light-skinned black guy!

Heh, uh huh? 

You're Lorde.

As long as Adams only choked the black half, I think it's okay.

Who paid you to call us and take our focus away from the investigation?! What color were they?!
