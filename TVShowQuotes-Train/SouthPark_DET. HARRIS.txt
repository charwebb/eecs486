Mr. Marsh, forgive me if I say your story sounds a little farfetched. You're saying that these people who what you killed are entertainment producers?
Yeah? Wait. Mitchell, listen to this one.  Start over: what's the setup?
All right, listen up! We believe this is where the black people are! They're holograms, so we can't choke them or shoot them, so stand by till we figure out what the hell to do!
Oh, it's a new one.  Aw, shit! Look out! 
Okay! Okay. Okay. Hold on.  Okay, go ahead.
Right. Roosters are being forced against their will to play "Magic: the Gathering," and you know nothing about it because you're 'white'. Let's git something straight: cock Magic isn't an Asian thing or a Mexican thing. White people do it too, if they're poor enough. You got a junked car in your front yard, Mr. McCormick. Care to tell us where the cock Magic fights are being held?
He's not a Native American, damnit! That's obvious!
Alright alright, let's focus. What kind of decks were they using?
We know we can't, but we're trying to! Jesus, tell them we're workiing on it!
We saw your fliers.  "Panda Express. Cock Magic at 9 pm."
Uh huh. And what about the cock Magic? Where was that? 
Okay, okay, so we're agreeing the hologram is black. So the question is, if he's black, then how come we couldn't choke him?
Oh my God. Are you sure that hologram is black??
Freeze!  Well, well! Looks like I finally caught the big boys! You're all going to jail for a long time!  Especially you, scumbag!
Oh, I get it now. Do you know what the penalty is for calling in a false cock Magic report?
That isn't even close! We have to be able to prove that hologram is a light-skinned black guy!
Who paid you to call us and take our focus away from the investigation?! What color were they?!
Let's cut the crap, huh? We know there's an illegal cock Magic ring going on in town, we just wanna know who's leading it.
Yehah? Hang on! Mitch!  Two black guys in the upstairs of the house. One of them is threatening the other one.  Okay, go ahead.
