Morty, Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out.
The pen. The one Jack Klompus gave you.
Cause if you don't like it, give it back to him.
Hello, Jerry. (to the senior Seinfelds) I just got off the phone with Saul Brandus.
(to Helen) Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?
So where's the new pen? (everybody's surprised by this question)
Now, my sources tell me, there's three votes for impeachment, three votes against impeachment, and one undecided.
Because my nephew Larry could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer. He says Jack has no case.
Not because he think you stole the money, but mainly because you never thanked him for giving you his aisle seat at Freddy Roman's show.
I don't know. She said Jerry wanted the pen.
Okay. I'll see you at the Lichtenberg's, tonight.
Oh. Probably they think you're too good for them. You know, because of the car.
That's some good pen. It writes upside down.
