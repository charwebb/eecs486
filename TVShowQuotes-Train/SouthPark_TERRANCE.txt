Oh no Phillip, looks like you're about to fart.

They're all stupid anyway.  Come on guys, let's go.

Celine, I brought our daughter Sally back, and I want to tell you that--

You've got a man over, don't you, Celine Dion?!

Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass.

Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig.

Hey dumbasses.  You morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet?

Oh, that was Sir Smelly. He says 'hello.'

Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, "Hey, where's Phillip?" Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK!  You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines!

Yes.  If people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are.

Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart.

That's called a monkey claw because it feels like my colon is being ripped apart by a thousand monkeys!

No, Phillip, I really thought I did everything. Until I- tried to do it alone. 

It sure is, Phillip. But I do believe this steer I'm riding has the farts. 

I may be fat but at least I didn't get hair plugs!

Yes. We can get satellite feed from the U.S. and watch all their stupid T.V. shows.

My doing?? These kids called me and said it was your idea and that you wanted to apologize.

Very nice place you have here. Network must be paying you well.

Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news.

Yes, we have dad. My very own human clone.

Ahh, listen, ahh, we've been talking it over, and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing.

But this is taking too long, and Phillip is diabetic.

Wroong. We've already got our human clone well under way. 

Well. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip. 

You cheating bastards.  This isn't over, just wait until tomorrow.

Say, Phillip, I have a question for you.

All right, enough with the queefing! We didn't come for a social call!

Sure. You go the same way  except stick your finger up your ass.

The good news is, you have a clean bill of health.

Oh, yes. Didn't I mention that, me hearty?

Right, the guy that drank his own urine.

Crap. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip.

Look, buddih, me and Phillip need to go home for a bit.

Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay?

Hold on a minute! Wait just a second!  We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars!

No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore. 

You know I never turn down Kroff Dinner, Phillip.  I'm going to put on a pirate costume. 

We're just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford.

Hurgh, urgh.  Damn it! Pull really hard, Phillip!

You didn't build a mobile game, you built an addiction machine!

I never needed you in the first place, yuh hack! 

We did it, Phillip! We destroyed the Turks!

I'm here, Sally. It's your father, Terrance.  I'm here to save you from your smelly Arabian captors.

Hey Phillip, would you like to eat some beans.

Because you've reduced Canada Channel to smut and toilet humor!

No it isn't.  Wanna see what's on the inside of me? 

Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!

HA! Goood luck getting Phillip! He left because he wanted to do  "more serious" stuff. Last I heard, he was doing Canadian Shakespeare in Toronto.

Oh, Phillip, you saved me from the gas chamber. 

I'm sorry, Scott. Could you hold on a minute?

Say Phillip, I just bought this new hybrid car.

That sure was fun, Phillip. Let's go home and eat Kraft Dinner.

Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly.

And now, for some classic Terrance and Phillip comedy! 

Halfway? Then all you've got is a stupid pig.

Phillip and I are going to Iran to find her, but we may never return.

What's the big idea making a mobile game without our approval?!

Sure thing, Phillip.  Ah ha ha ha, you got me again! 

Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like?

Well, now that I have my bastard daughter back, I feel like going to Celine Dion's house and asking her to marry me again.

Wrong! She's been taken hostage, and is now being held prisoner.

Hey, they've got our clone.  He belongs to us.

Yes, indeed.  But now my little Sally is being held captive in Iran.  And I will have to go and find her.

Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids.  What do you want, an autograph or something?

Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!

We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope.

Because I had an itch up my ass. 

Is there a penny stuck in my butt?

No! It's Sally. She's being held captive in Iran.

But then all our profits come from people with problems.

Because I'm suddenly finding myself strangely attracted to Katherine.

Sure, buddy! All you need to do is go down to the , and that's how you  get to the auto garage!

No. No, Phillip, don't say it. I was an asshole, and this is mostly my fault.

Hurgh-rrh. Waiwait, wait wait. Hrhrhrhrh. Aha! Hr-rhrh. Oh my! Yeee-aaa!  Hurh. Uhwaiwait. Ye-aauraah-  Caught you there!

Oh. Well. It all began fif-teen years ago.

Hey, Phillip. Isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town?

Oh, Phillip. How will we ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place? We don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers, and we have no idea where to begin.

I don't know, Phillip. It looks like the alien species here breathe an inert gas.

Well, I guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad.

Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Boys, Mr. Garrison, fellow students, for our science fair project Bill, Fosse, and I have spawned a creature genetically far superior to man.  I present to you, the five-assed monkey. 

Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he's not showing up! 

ALL RIGHT, JUST WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE??!!

Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better. 

What's going on, Phillip? How can Canada have changed so much whilst we were gone?

It sure did, Phillip.  Oh, wait. That is the phone.  Hello?

Oh, Phillip, now you farted during the closing argument!

Oh Celine Dion. You never finished that national anthem.

OOOH! Sure! Just stick your finger up my ass.

Terrific! We need two tickets for Tehran, please.

Hey, Phillip. I have to go to Iraq and find my kidnapped daughter.

Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea.

Yes, Phillip. I'm making a case for our defense. 

God no!  Oh, Phillip, your anthrax has given me colon cancer!

Shiver me timbers, Phillip! At this rate I'll never get to my Kraft Dinner!  Oh my God!

Phillip, I think I may have accidentally killed Celine Dion.

You son of a bitch! You paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game?!

I must take my bastard daughter back to Celine Dion and see what she has to say.

Jesus Christ! That was fast! Well, what should we name it? How about Jerry?

Oh wait, I have another call on, Scott. Can you hold on?

Ah, I know.  I know he sucks  To be honest, things haven't been going so well lately. I'm not making any money because everyone wants to see Phillip. Why? What the hell does Phillip do?

Phillip, I'm convinced that something very very not good is happening to Canada.

Well. Phillip, I am very sad that we have to die for Canada.

By Friday, we're gonna clone a whole human being.  Good luck with your stupid little pig.

Sure you can, Ugly Bob. If they can't see how horribly disfigured you are, they'll want to sleep with you.

Yes. See this X-ray?  That's your ass. See this line?  That's your ass collapsing. Your ass is collapsing.

Huh, eh,  wait wait wait.  Eh, eh.  Here it comes, ehhhh.  Daaaah, I crapped in my pants!

Could you please keep it down? We're trying to have sex over here.

Ogh, whatever.  The point is, Phillip and I are through.  And apparently, so is the act. And so is the money.

My God, you're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob.

Well, let us board the subway and return home. There we can eat Kraft Dinner!

But Family Guy is going to show Mohammad on an episode that airs tonight!

You replaced our show with this?! But they aren't funny! All they do is queef all the time!

Hello Mohammad, we've read all aboat you in the Koran.
