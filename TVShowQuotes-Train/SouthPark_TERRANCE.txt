Say, Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week.

My doing?? These kids called me and said it was your idea and that you wanted to apologize.

Alright, I'm here. Where do I-?

Don't call me a rat, buddih!

You're a huge fan alright!

Same here, Phillip!

What the hell are you doing here?!

Ohho God. 

Ow, that's rancid! hahahahaha.

Hey Phillip, guess what?

But dad!  I want a human clone.

Hurgh. Oh, wait wait wait. Pull harder.

After everything we've been through? 

No, Phillip, I really thought I did everything. Until I- tried to do it alone. 

Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids.  What do you want, an autograph or something?

Ooh, stop that! 

And now here's a classic Terrance and Phillip sketch that I wrote back in '62. 

No, you're gaining a pop vocalist.

Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly.

He's not your buddih, friend!

Hellooo, Den-ver! 

Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like?

Now, Phlllip?

We just grew apart, Celine Dion. 

Why, did you fart?  Oh, no! 

Look at him, Celine Dion! 

That's called a monkey claw because it feels like my colon is being ripped apart by a thousand monkeys!

It sure did, Phillip.  Oh, wait. That is the phone.  Hello?

Phillip, I'm convinced that something very very not good is happening to Canada.

Me neither.

Wow, Scott really hates us, Phillip.

ALL RIGHT, JUST WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE??!!

Yes. See this X-ray?  That's your ass. See this line?  That's your ass collapsing. Your ass is collapsing.

You know I never turn down Kroff Dinner, Phillip.  I'm going to put on a pirate costume. 

Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea.

Oh wait, I have another call on, Scott. Can you hold on?

Oh, good. 

Yes. I'm afraid your ass is collapsing.

Because you've reduced Canada Channel to smut and toilet humor!

I spattered his face! 

Because I'm suddenly finding myself strangely attracted to Katherine.

Well, in that case, I'd say you four boys are up Fart Creek without a paddle. 

It sure does Phillip. No one will oppress our religion here. 

What?! Gross! 

Hey, Scott, you like apples?

Yes!

Right, the guy that drank his own urine.

I'm sorry, Scott. Could you hold on a minute?

He's not your guy, friend!

Hello Mohammad, we've read all aboat you in the Koran.

Oh no. 

Faaart.

No. No, Phillip, don't say it. I was an asshole, and this is mostly my fault.

Phillip says hello, Scott.

Celine, I brought our daughter Sally back, and I want to tell you that--

Watch me plebeian.

Well. Phillip, I am very sad that we have to die for Canada.

I must take my bastard daughter back to Celine Dion and see what she has to say.

What the hell am I going to do, Phillip? She makes me so mad sometimes.

Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay?

How's the paper bag working out?

Wait. Before you do, pull my thumb.

Ogh, whatever.  The point is, Phillip and I are through.  And apparently, so is the act. And so is the money.

Yes. Apparently, he does.

Well, now that I have my bastard daughter back, I feel like going to Celine Dion's house and asking her to marry me again.

They're all stupid anyway.  Come on guys, let's go.

Oh, Phillip, what a precious gift! 

Yeah, let's give it up, guy.

Here's a missile for ya! 

Hey, Scott. Guess what?

By Friday, we're gonna clone a whole human being.  Good luck with your stupid little pig.

SICK!

Ahh, listen, ahh, we've been talking it over, and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing.

In-deed, Phillip.

OOOH! Sure! Just stick your finger up my ass.

Wrong! She's been taken hostage, and is now being held prisoner.

They look like groundhogs.

Hey Phillip, would you like a flower?

Oh dear God! It's the Canadian Devil!

What?! Nooooooooooooooooo!!

We're setting you adrift, idiot!

Well, I guess it's time, old friend.

Oh, Celine Dion, what have you done? I was going to make us a family again, but now you've slept with Ugly Bob!

Avast there, mateys!

Who.

You didn't build a mobile game, you built an addiction machine!

Hey, they've got our clone.  He belongs to us.

You're an asshole Phillip.

We sure did.

No! It's Sally. She's being held captive in Iran.

Sure thing, Phillip.  Ah ha ha ha, you got me again! 

Sure you can, Ugly Bob. If they can't see how horribly disfigured you are, they'll want to sleep with you.

For Canada, Phillip. 

Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he's not showing up! 

Oh.  Hey, it's Scott. 

That plan's scary!

Thank you everyone, thank you! You know, Phillip and I have learned an important lesson: that when you go through a lot with somebody, you can't let trite things come between you.

Yes, Phillip. I'm making a case for our defense. 

I'm here, Sally. It's your father, Terrance.  I'm here to save you from your smelly Arabian captors.

Doctor, doctor, I've cracked my ass.

Let me see. 

God no!  Oh, Phillip, your anthrax has given me colon cancer!

Oh no Phillip, looks like you're about to fart.

Yeah.

Oh, Phillip, now you farted during the closing argument!

But then all our profits come from people with problems.

Dad, you're the best.

Would you like a monkey claw, Phillip?

I am, Phillip. I am.

Hey Phillip, could you pass the beans?

I never needed you in the first place, yuh hack! 

Phillip and I are going to Iran to find her, but we may never return.

Hurgh, urgh.  Damn it! Pull really hard, Phillip!

But what do I get in return?

Your idols?

We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope.

Yes.  If people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are.

Oh no!

Is there a penny stuck in my butt?

Hey Phillip, guess what?

Well, I guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad.

Say, Phillip, I have a question for you.

Yes. We can get satellite feed from the U.S. and watch all their stupid T.V. shows.

The bad news is, you have cancer. 

Oh wow! We had quadruplets! 

How do you like that, Scott?!

Oh, hello, Scott.

Hey Phillip! Pull my finger!  Aaaahahahaha. 

Who?

Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, "Hey, where's Phillip?" Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK!  You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines!

You son of a bitch! You paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game?!

It seems to have changed.

Look, buddih, me and Phillip need to go home for a bit.

We're not your buddih, guy!

No, it uses natural gas. 

Why is that?

Phillip, I think I may have accidentally killed Celine Dion.

Hello Phillip.

Who passed gas!

Phillip?! I'm Terrance!

Crap. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip.

Daddy! Nooooo!

Yaaay!

Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check? 

You're a dick.

Mmm. Mmm, yummy.  Mmm. 

Uh. What? That's not the line, asshole!

Queef Sisters?!

Well, let us board the subway and return home. There we can eat Kraft Dinner!

You're at the auto garage. I am the mechanic.

That sure was fun, Phillip. Let's go home and eat Kraft Dinner.

All right, enough with the queefing! We didn't come for a social call!

You like that? 

Sure. You go the same way  except stick your finger up your ass.

Hey, Phillip. I have to go to Iraq and find my kidnapped daughter.

You've got a man over, don't you, Celine Dion?!

Ah good.

Hey dumbasses.  You morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet?

Say Phillip, I just bought this new hybrid car.

I don't know, Phillip. It looks like the alien species here breathe an inert gas.

Ah, I know.  I know he sucks  To be honest, things haven't been going so well lately. I'm not making any money because everyone wants to see Phillip. Why? What the hell does Phillip do?

Head cancer??

Well, we just can't sit here and eat Kraft Dinner and let Canada be overrun by the Turks! 

Wait, before you do, pull my thumb. 

You cheating bastards.  This isn't over, just wait until tomorrow.

What's this?

But you ruined the whole show!

Ditto!

We did it, Phillip! We destroyed the Turks!

Oh, Phillip. You're still here, too.

But he's our science fair project!

But we're not gay, Phillip.

AAHahahahahahaaa!

You are such a dick, Scott.

Sure, buddy! All you need to do is go down to the , and that's how you  get to the auto garage!

AAH! 

Gosh, I hope we don't starve.

I still don't see anything, Phillip.

So this is- Everyone is doing this?

Who IS this guy?!

I don't think I can do it, Phillip. 

Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news.

Oh, wait a second, Scott.

Fired?!

Shiver me timbers, Phillip! At this rate I'll never get to my Kraft Dinner!  Oh my God!

Hey Phillip, would you like to eat some beans.

Oh, yes. Didn't I mention that, me hearty?

Katie, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

We're looking for treasure!

Oh yeah.  Oh, that's good, baby.

It's so stupid!

Brian, don't do this!

He sure did, Phillip.

Because I had an itch up my ass. 

You're a dick.

God only knows.

Yeah-

Because babies come from there!

Well, it smells like, a dirty fart! 

Ohhh, you farted. 

Jesus Christ! That was fast! Well, what should we name it? How about Jerry?

Well, you've come to the right place. 

Hello, Celine Dion.

Check out this one.  

Very nice place you have here. Network must be paying you well.

Oh Celine Dion. You never finished that national anthem.

Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!

Hello, and welcome to Progressive. 

Yes, I sure did! 

True patriot loveIn all thy sons' command

That's stupid.

You're a dick.

Boo!

Yes, indeed.  But now my little Sally is being held captive in Iran.  And I will have to go and find her.

How are we all feeling tonight? Pretty good? Uh oh.  Hey, do you all remember this one? "Doctor, doctor. I think I cracked my ass." "Reallih? Let me take a look." "Look closer." 

We're just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford.

Well, enough of Iran, let's get home. 

HA! Goood luck getting Phillip! He left because he wanted to do  "more serious" stuff. Last I heard, he was doing Canadian Shakespeare in Toronto.

Because you're God-damned ugly, Bob.

No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore. 

(Fart)

But Family Guy is going to show Mohammad on an episode that airs tonight!

I may be fat but at least I didn't get hair plugs!

Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig.

Hey Phillip.

Hey, Phillip, pull my finger.

What's going on, Phillip? How can Canada have changed so much whilst we were gone?

Oh, Phillip, you saved me from the gas chamber. 

Oh. Well. It all began fif-teen years ago.

It sure is, Phillip. But I do believe this steer I'm riding has the farts. 

Terrance & Phillip will be right back...

And now, for some classic Terrance and Phillip comedy! 

How do you like them apples? 

Haha, that I am! 

Wait, before you do, pull my thumb. 

Hold on a minute! Wait just a second!  We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars!

No, that was me, Phillip. I farted.

Celine, where is our daughter, Sally?

Huh, eh,  wait wait wait.  Eh, eh.  Here it comes, ehhhh.  Daaaah, I crapped in my pants!

Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!

The good news is, you have a clean bill of health.

Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Boys, Mr. Garrison, fellow students, for our science fair project Bill, Fosse, and I have spawned a creature genetically far superior to man.  I present to you, the five-assed monkey. 

Could you please keep it down? We're trying to have sex over here.

But this is taking too long, and Phillip is diabetic.

You're a dick.

You're such a good friend, Phillip.

What's going on here? 

Hey Phillip! 

That's funny!

Well I'm not your friend, buddih!

Well. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip. 

Hello there, Phillip. I brought you something

You replaced our show with this?! But they aren't funny! All they do is queef all the time!

My daughter.

Yes, we have dad. My very own human clone.

Halfway? Then all you've got is a stupid pig.

Just do the bit right, dickface!

Wroong. We've already got our human clone well under way. 

Why?!

Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass.
