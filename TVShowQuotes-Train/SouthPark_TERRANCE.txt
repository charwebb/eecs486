Here's a missile for ya! 

You replaced our show with this?! But they aren't funny! All they do is queef all the time!

We're looking for treasure!

Hey Phillip, would you like a flower?

My daughter.

Oh no. 

Watch me plebeian.

You are such a dick, Scott.

Well, let us board the subway and return home. There we can eat Kraft Dinner!

God no!  Oh, Phillip, your anthrax has given me colon cancer!

You're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob.

Thank you everyone, thank you! You know, Phillip and I have learned an important lesson: that when you go through a lot with somebody, you can't let trite things come between you.

Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news.

Crap. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip.

My doing?? These kids called me and said it was your idea and that you wanted to apologize.

Wait, before you do, pull my thumb. 

Oh, Phillip, you saved me from the gas chamber. 

Yes. We can get satellite feed from the U.S. and watch all their stupid T.V. shows.

Yes!

Me neither.

Phillip, I think I may have accidentally killed Celine Dion.

Uh. What? That's not the line, asshole!

Hey, Phillip, pull my finger.

You're a dick.

OOOH! Sure! Just stick your finger up my ass.

Ah good.

Hey, they've got our clone.  He belongs to us.

Yaaay!

What?! Nooooooooooooooooo!!

Why is that?

Because you're God-damned ugly, Bob.

You're a huge fan alright!

Oh, good. 

It sure does Phillip. No one will oppress our religion here. 

Who passed gas!

Ooh, it was all Phillip's idea. 

Hey Phillip, would you like to eat some beans.

That plan's scary!

Oh, Phillip. How will we ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place? We don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers, and we have no idea where to begin.

Oh, yes. Didn't I mention that, me hearty?

It sure is. Let's look for treasure.

Who IS this guy?!

Well. Phillip, I am very sad that we have to die for Canada.

Terrific! We need two tickets for Tehran, please.

Oh, Phillip. You're still here, too.

Jesus Christ! That was fast! Well, what should we name it? How about Jerry?

Ah, I know.  I know he sucks  To be honest, things haven't been going so well lately. I'm not making any money because everyone wants to see Phillip. Why? What the hell does Phillip do?

Ooh, stop that! 

You're a dick.

Hey dumbasses.  You morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet?

We just grew apart, Celine Dion. 

Look at him, Celine Dion! 

Ogh, whatever.  The point is, Phillip and I are through.  And apparently, so is the act. And so is the money.

You know I never turn down Kroff Dinner, Phillip.  I'm going to put on a pirate costume. 

(Fart)

I'm here, Sally. It's your father, Terrance.  I'm here to save you from your smelly Arabian captors.

Boo!

I'm sorry, Scott. Could you hold on a minute?

It seems to have changed.

Hello Phillip.

Hurgh, urgh.  Damn it! Pull really hard, Phillip!

He sure did, Phillip.

What the hell am I going to do, Phillip? She makes me so mad sometimes.

Very nice place you have here. Network must be paying you well.

Well, now that I have my bastard daughter back, I feel like going to Celine Dion's house and asking her to marry me again.

Yes, we have dad. My very own human clone.

Hey, Phillip. Isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town?

My God, you're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob.

Hellooo, Den-ver! 

Oh.  Hey, it's Scott. 

Wow, Scott really hates us, Phillip.

We're not your buddih, guy!

Ey! There's some anthrax over there! 

Oh dear God! It's the Canadian Devil!

Terrance & Phillip will be right back...

How do you like them apples? 

Hello there, Phillip. I brought you something

You're at the auto garage. I am the mechanic.

Celine, I brought our daughter Sally back, and I want to tell you that--

I am, Phillip. I am.

The good news is, you have a clean bill of health.

Now, Phlllip?

Well, it smells like, a dirty fart! 

Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!

Yes. Apparently, he does.

Gosh, I hope we don't starve.

No, it uses natural gas. 

Sure, buddy! All you need to do is go down to the , and that's how you  get to the auto garage!

Who.

We're just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford.

Hey, Scott. Guess what?

You're such a good friend, Phillip.

Because I had an itch up my ass. 

Fired?!

Because babies come from there!

Dad, you're the best.

We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope.

Shiver me timbers, Phillip! At this rate I'll never get to my Kraft Dinner!  Oh my God!

Ahh, listen, ahh, we've been talking it over, and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing.

But this is taking too long, and Phillip is diabetic.

No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore. 

You're a dick.

Well. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip. 

You like that? 

Oh, wait a second, Scott.

Yes, Phillip. I'm making a case for our defense. 

They're all stupid anyway.  Come on guys, let's go.

Oh no!

Huh, eh,  wait wait wait.  Eh, eh.  Here it comes, ehhhh.  Daaaah, I crapped in my pants!

He's not your guy, friend!

Queef Sisters?!

HA! Goood luck getting Phillip! He left because he wanted to do  "more serious" stuff. Last I heard, he was doing Canadian Shakespeare in Toronto.

Right, the guy that drank his own urine.

The bad news is, you have cancer. 

Same here, Phillip!

You're a dick.

Well, we just can't sit here and eat Kraft Dinner and let Canada be overrun by the Turks! 

Yes, I sure did! 

For Canada, Phillip. 

Is there a penny stuck in my butt?

Because you've reduced Canada Channel to smut and toilet humor!

Wait. Before you do, pull my thumb.

What's this?

You cheating bastards.  This isn't over, just wait until tomorrow.

What the hell are you doing here?!

Halfway? Then all you've got is a stupid pig.

Hold on a minute! Wait just a second!  We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars!

Oh no Phillip, looks like you're about to fart.

Oh. Well. It all began fif-teen years ago.

What's going on here? 

Oh Celine Dion. You never finished that national anthem.

Oh yeah.  Oh, that's good, baby.

Yeah-

Well I'm not your friend, buddih!

Oh, Phillip, what a precious gift! 

Could you please keep it down? We're trying to have sex over here.

Hello, Celine Dion.

AAHahahahahahaaa!

Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he's not showing up! 

Check out this one.  

Wrong! She's been taken hostage, and is now being held prisoner.

Wait, before you do, pull my thumb. 

What?! Gross! 

I don't see anything.

Doctor, doctor, I've cracked my ass.

Mmm. Mmm, yummy.  Mmm. 

God only knows.

Yes, indeed.  But now my little Sally is being held captive in Iran.  And I will have to go and find her.

So this is- Everyone is doing this?

Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Boys, Mr. Garrison, fellow students, for our science fair project Bill, Fosse, and I have spawned a creature genetically far superior to man.  I present to you, the five-assed monkey. 

And now, for some classic Terrance and Phillip comedy! 

Look, buddih, me and Phillip need to go home for a bit.

I sure am cold, Phillip.

You didn't build a mobile game, you built an addiction machine!

Hurgh. Oh, wait wait wait. Pull harder.

Just do the bit right, dickface!

I don't think I can do it, Phillip. 

How are we all feeling tonight? Pretty good? Uh oh.  Hey, do you all remember this one? "Doctor, doctor. I think I cracked my ass." "Reallih? Let me take a look." "Look closer." 

Look closer. 

Oh wow! We had quadruplets! 

Celine, where is our daughter, Sally?

They look like groundhogs.

Phillip says hello, Scott.

That's the man's name?

Phillip and I are going to Iran to find her, but we may never return.

ALL RIGHT, JUST WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE??!!

Hey, Phillip. I have to go to Iraq and find my kidnapped daughter.

But then all our profits come from people with problems.

I never needed you in the first place, yuh hack! 

And now here's a classic Terrance and Phillip sketch that I wrote back in '62. 

Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass.

Would you like a monkey claw, Phillip?

Oh. Good idea. Let's search for treasure. 

You're looking well.

Hey Phillip, guess what?

Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!

That's stupid.

That's called a monkey claw because it feels like my colon is being ripped apart by a thousand monkeys!

Hey Phillip, guess what?

In-deed, Phillip.

Ohohoho, nohoho! 

We did it, Phillip! We destroyed the Turks!

True patriot loveIn all thy sons' command

You son of a bitch! You paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game?!

It sure did, Phillip.  Oh, wait. That is the phone.  Hello?

Avast there, mateys!

But he's our science fair project!

Okay, here I come, okay. 

Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig.

Yes. See this X-ray?  That's your ass. See this line?  That's your ass collapsing. Your ass is collapsing.

Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly.

AAH! 

After everything we've been through? 

We're setting you adrift, idiot!

But Family Guy is going to show Mohammad on an episode that airs tonight!

Well, you've come to the right place. 

Wroong. We've already got our human clone well under way. 

Ditto!

It's so stupid!

Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea.

All right, enough with the queefing! We didn't come for a social call!

Let me see. 

Daddy! Nooooo!

But dad!  I want a human clone.

Oh, Celine Dion, what have you done? I was going to make us a family again, but now you've slept with Ugly Bob!

I don't know, Phillip. It looks like the alien species here breathe an inert gas.

Yes.  If people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are.

Faaart.

Sure. You go the same way  except stick your finger up your ass.

Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check? 

Oh, Phillip, now you farted during the closing argument!

Hey Phillip! 

Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart.

Well, enough of Iran, let's get home. 

Hey Phillip, could you pass the beans?

Sure thing, Phillip.  Ah ha ha ha, you got me again! 

How do you like that, Scott?!

Oh, that was Sir Smelly. He says 'hello.'

Phillip?! I'm Terrance!

Sure you can, Ugly Bob. If they can't see how horribly disfigured you are, they'll want to sleep with you.

Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay?

Fart.

Hello Mohammad, we've read all aboat you in the Koran.

He sure did.

Haha, that I am! 

Well, I guess it's time, old friend.

You've got a man over, don't you, Celine Dion?!

I may be fat but at least I didn't get hair plugs!

Head cancer??

He's not your buddih, friend!

Brian, don't do this!

I still don't see anything, Phillip.

No. No, Phillip, don't say it. I was an asshole, and this is mostly my fault.

How's the paper bag working out?

Why, did you fart?  Oh, no! 

That's funny!

Hey Phillip.

We sure did, baby.  Next? 

You're an asshole Phillip.

Katie, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

Oh, hello, Scott.

I spattered his face! 

Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like?

I must take my bastard daughter back to Celine Dion and see what she has to say.

Phillip, I'm convinced that something very very not good is happening to Canada.

What's going on, Phillip? How can Canada have changed so much whilst we were gone?

Hurgh-rrh. Waiwait, wait wait. Hrhrhrhrh. Aha! Hr-rhrh. Oh my! Yeee-aaa!  Hurh. Uhwaiwait. Ye-aauraah-  Caught you there!

Who!

Your idols?

Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better. 

Say Phillip, I just bought this new hybrid car.

We sure did.

No, Phillip, I really thought I did everything. Until I- tried to do it alone. 

Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids.  What do you want, an autograph or something?

Yeah, let's give it up, guy.

Oh wait, I have another call on, Scott. Can you hold on?

No, you're gaining a pop vocalist.

Because I'm suddenly finding myself strangely attracted to Katherine.

Alright, I'm here. Where do I-?

Don't call me a rat, buddih!
