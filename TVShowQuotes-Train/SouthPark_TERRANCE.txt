Well, let us board the subway and return home. There we can eat Kraft Dinner!
You're at the auto garage. I am the mechanic.
Oh no Phillip, looks like you're about to fart.
That's called a monkey claw because it feels like my colon is being ripped apart by a thousand monkeys!
OOOH! Sure! Just stick your finger up my ass.
I must take my bastard daughter back to Celine Dion and see what she has to say.
What's the big idea making a mobile game without our approval?!
My doing?? These kids called me and said it was your idea and that you wanted to apologize.
Sure, buddy! All you need to do is go down to the , and that's how you  get to the auto garage!
You've got a man over, don't you, Celine Dion?!
Hello Mohammad, we've read all aboat you in the Koran.
But then all our profits come from people with problems.
Hey, Phillip. Isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town?
We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope.
Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Boys, Mr. Garrison, fellow students, for our science fair project Bill, Fosse, and I have spawned a creature genetically far superior to man.  I present to you, the five-assed monkey. 
It sure did, Phillip.  Oh, wait. That is the phone.  Hello?
Ahh, listen, ahh, we've been talking it over, and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing.
Oh, yes. Didn't I mention that, me hearty?
Phillip and I are going to Iran to find her, but we may never return.
ALL RIGHT, JUST WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE??!!
Wrong! She's been taken hostage, and is now being held prisoner.
Hold on a minute! Wait just a second!  We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars!
Oh Celine Dion. You never finished that national anthem.
Well. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip. 
Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, "Hey, where's Phillip?" Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK!  You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines!
Say, Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week.
Hey Phillip, would you like to eat some beans.
Oh, Phillip, now you farted during the closing argument!
I don't know, Phillip. It looks like the alien species here breathe an inert gas.
Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!
No. No, Phillip, don't say it. I was an asshole, and this is mostly my fault.
Look, buddih, me and Phillip need to go home for a bit.
You didn't build a mobile game, you built an addiction machine!
I may be fat but at least I didn't get hair plugs!
Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he's not showing up! 
Well, I guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad.
I'm sorry, Scott. Could you hold on a minute?
I'm here, Sally. It's your father, Terrance.  I'm here to save you from your smelly Arabian captors.
Yes. See this X-ray?  That's your ass. See this line?  That's your ass collapsing. Your ass is collapsing.
You know I never turn down Kroff Dinner, Phillip.  I'm going to put on a pirate costume. 
And now, for some classic Terrance and Phillip comedy! 
Hey dumbasses.  You morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet?
I don't think I can do it, Phillip. 
You cheating bastards.  This isn't over, just wait until tomorrow.
Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass.
Hurgh, urgh.  Damn it! Pull really hard, Phillip!
Right, the guy that drank his own urine.
Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig.
No! It's Sally. She's being held captive in Iran.
That sure was fun, Phillip. Let's go home and eat Kraft Dinner.
They're all stupid anyway.  Come on guys, let's go.
Oh, Phillip. How will we ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place? We don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers, and we have no idea where to begin.
Phillip, I'm convinced that something very very not good is happening to Canada.
Wroong. We've already got our human clone well under way. 
And now here's a classic Terrance and Phillip sketch that I wrote back in '62. 
We did it, Phillip! We destroyed the Turks!
All right, enough with the queefing! We didn't come for a social call!
Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay?
Oh wait, I have another call on, Scott. Can you hold on?
It sure does Phillip. No one will oppress our religion here. 
Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea.
Oh. Well. It all began fif-teen years ago.
It sure is, Phillip. But I do believe this steer I'm riding has the farts. 
But this is taking too long, and Phillip is diabetic.
Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly.
Well, in that case, I'd say you four boys are up Fart Creek without a paddle. 
Jesus Christ! That was fast! Well, what should we name it? How about Jerry?
Oh, Celine Dion, what have you done? I was going to make us a family again, but now you've slept with Ugly Bob!
Very nice place you have here. Network must be paying you well.
Hey, Phillip. I have to go to Iraq and find my kidnapped daughter.
I never needed you in the first place, yuh hack! 
Phillip, I think I may have accidentally killed Celine Dion.
Oh, Phillip, you saved me from the gas chamber. 
Yes, indeed.  But now my little Sally is being held captive in Iran.  And I will have to go and find her.
Shiver me timbers, Phillip! At this rate I'll never get to my Kraft Dinner!  Oh my God!
Hey, they've got our clone.  He belongs to us.
Sure you can, Ugly Bob. If they can't see how horribly disfigured you are, they'll want to sleep with you.
Because you've reduced Canada Channel to smut and toilet humor!
Thank you everyone, thank you! You know, Phillip and I have learned an important lesson: that when you go through a lot with somebody, you can't let trite things come between you.
But Family Guy is going to show Mohammad on an episode that airs tonight!
Oh, that was Sir Smelly. He says 'hello.'
How are we all feeling tonight? Pretty good? Uh oh.  Hey, do you all remember this one? "Doctor, doctor. I think I cracked my ass." "Reallih? Let me take a look." "Look closer." 
Yes. We can get satellite feed from the U.S. and watch all their stupid T.V. shows.
Say, Phillip, I have a question for you.
Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check? 
No it isn't.  Wanna see what's on the inside of me? 
No, Phillip, I really thought I did everything. Until I- tried to do it alone. 
Halfway? Then all you've got is a stupid pig.
Yes, Phillip. I'm making a case for our defense. 
You son of a bitch! You paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game?!
Because I had an itch up my ass. 
No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore. 
Hurgh-rrh. Waiwait, wait wait. Hrhrhrhrh. Aha! Hr-rhrh. Oh my! Yeee-aaa!  Hurh. Uhwaiwait. Ye-aauraah-  Caught you there!
Ogh, whatever.  The point is, Phillip and I are through.  And apparently, so is the act. And so is the money.
Terrific! We need two tickets for Tehran, please.
Well, now that I have my bastard daughter back, I feel like going to Celine Dion's house and asking her to marry me again.
Well, we just can't sit here and eat Kraft Dinner and let Canada be overrun by the Turks! 
Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news.
Sure thing, Phillip.  Ah ha ha ha, you got me again! 
Yes, we have dad. My very own human clone.
We're just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford.
Sure. You go the same way  except stick your finger up your ass.
Celine, I brought our daughter Sally back, and I want to tell you that--
Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!
Say Phillip, I just bought this new hybrid car.
Well. Phillip, I am very sad that we have to die for Canada.
Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like?
Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better. 
What's going on, Phillip? How can Canada have changed so much whilst we were gone?
Ah, I know.  I know he sucks  To be honest, things haven't been going so well lately. I'm not making any money because everyone wants to see Phillip. Why? What the hell does Phillip do?
God no!  Oh, Phillip, your anthrax has given me colon cancer!
What the hell am I going to do, Phillip? She makes me so mad sometimes.
You replaced our show with this?! But they aren't funny! All they do is queef all the time!
