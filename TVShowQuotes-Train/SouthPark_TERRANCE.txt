Very nice place you have here. Network must be paying you well.
Because I'm suddenly finding myself strangely attracted to Katherine.
Well, I guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad.
What's the big idea making a mobile game without our approval?!
I'm sorry, Scott. Could you hold on a minute?
I must take my bastard daughter back to Celine Dion and see what she has to say.
Hello Mohammad, we've read all aboat you in the Koran.
Well, let us board the subway and return home. There we can eat Kraft Dinner!
Well, in that case, I'd say you four boys are up Fart Creek without a paddle. 
No. No, Phillip, don't say it. I was an asshole, and this is mostly my fault.
We're just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford.
Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better. 
Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig.
All right, enough with the queefing! We didn't come for a social call!
You know I never turn down Kroff Dinner, Phillip.  I'm going to put on a pirate costume. 
It sure did, Phillip.  Oh, wait. That is the phone.  Hello?
The good news is, you have a clean bill of health.
Yes.  If people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are.
How are we all feeling tonight? Pretty good? Uh oh.  Hey, do you all remember this one? "Doctor, doctor. I think I cracked my ass." "Reallih? Let me take a look." "Look closer." 
Oh, Phillip, now you farted during the closing argument!
My God, you're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob.
Ogh, whatever.  The point is, Phillip and I are through.  And apparently, so is the act. And so is the money.
Ahh, listen, ahh, we've been talking it over, and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing.
I don't think I can do it, Phillip. 
Right, the guy that drank his own urine.
Say Phillip, I just bought this new hybrid car.
Sure you can, Ugly Bob. If they can't see how horribly disfigured you are, they'll want to sleep with you.
Oh, Phillip. How will we ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place? We don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers, and we have no idea where to begin.
Phillip and I are going to Iran to find her, but we may never return.
Could you please keep it down? We're trying to have sex over here.
That sure was fun, Phillip. Let's go home and eat Kraft Dinner.
Oh. Well. It all began fif-teen years ago.
Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news.
OOOH! Sure! Just stick your finger up my ass.
Oh, Celine Dion, what have you done? I was going to make us a family again, but now you've slept with Ugly Bob!
Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!
You're at the auto garage. I am the mechanic.
Because I had an itch up my ass. 
Oh, Phillip, you saved me from the gas chamber. 
Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids.  What do you want, an autograph or something?
Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, "Hey, where's Phillip?" Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK!  You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines!
Huh, eh,  wait wait wait.  Eh, eh.  Here it comes, ehhhh.  Daaaah, I crapped in my pants!
God no!  Oh, Phillip, your anthrax has given me colon cancer!
We did it, Phillip! We destroyed the Turks!
That's called a monkey claw because it feels like my colon is being ripped apart by a thousand monkeys!
Oh, yes. Didn't I mention that, me hearty?
ALL RIGHT, JUST WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE??!!
Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart.
Say, Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week.
Because you've reduced Canada Channel to smut and toilet humor!
Terrific! We need two tickets for Tehran, please.
You didn't build a mobile game, you built an addiction machine!
Wroong. We've already got our human clone well under way. 
Look, buddih, me and Phillip need to go home for a bit.
But this is taking too long, and Phillip is diabetic.
Say, Phillip, I have a question for you.
Hold on a minute! Wait just a second!  We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars!
Hey dumbasses.  You morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet?
I'm here, Sally. It's your father, Terrance.  I'm here to save you from your smelly Arabian captors.
Celine, I brought our daughter Sally back, and I want to tell you that--
No, Phillip, I really thought I did everything. Until I- tried to do it alone. 
And now here's a classic Terrance and Phillip sketch that I wrote back in '62. 
Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check? 
Yes, Phillip. I'm making a case for our defense. 
Phillip, I think I may have accidentally killed Celine Dion.
Yes. See this X-ray?  That's your ass. See this line?  That's your ass collapsing. Your ass is collapsing.
I may be fat but at least I didn't get hair plugs!
Oh no Phillip, looks like you're about to fart.
Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea.
You've got a man over, don't you, Celine Dion?!
Thank you everyone, thank you! You know, Phillip and I have learned an important lesson: that when you go through a lot with somebody, you can't let trite things come between you.
What the hell am I going to do, Phillip? She makes me so mad sometimes.
HA! Goood luck getting Phillip! He left because he wanted to do  "more serious" stuff. Last I heard, he was doing Canadian Shakespeare in Toronto.
Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass.
Wrong! She's been taken hostage, and is now being held prisoner.
Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay?
No it isn't.  Wanna see what's on the inside of me? 
Sure, buddy! All you need to do is go down to the , and that's how you  get to the auto garage!
And now, for some classic Terrance and Phillip comedy! 
Well, now that I have my bastard daughter back, I feel like going to Celine Dion's house and asking her to marry me again.
Oh Celine Dion. You never finished that national anthem.
I never needed you in the first place, yuh hack! 
We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope.
Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he's not showing up! 
By Friday, we're gonna clone a whole human being.  Good luck with your stupid little pig.
Hurgh, urgh.  Damn it! Pull really hard, Phillip!
Oh wait, I have another call on, Scott. Can you hold on?
Hey, Phillip. Isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town?
My doing?? These kids called me and said it was your idea and that you wanted to apologize.
Phillip, I'm convinced that something very very not good is happening to Canada.
Sure thing, Phillip.  Ah ha ha ha, you got me again! 
Is there a penny stuck in my butt?
Hey, they've got our clone.  He belongs to us.
Yes, indeed.  But now my little Sally is being held captive in Iran.  And I will have to go and find her.
No! It's Sally. She's being held captive in Iran.
Well, we just can't sit here and eat Kraft Dinner and let Canada be overrun by the Turks! 
You cheating bastards.  This isn't over, just wait until tomorrow.
It sure does Phillip. No one will oppress our religion here. 
Hurgh-rrh. Waiwait, wait wait. Hrhrhrhrh. Aha! Hr-rhrh. Oh my! Yeee-aaa!  Hurh. Uhwaiwait. Ye-aauraah-  Caught you there!
Yes, we have dad. My very own human clone.
Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly.
Well. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip. 
Halfway? Then all you've got is a stupid pig.
They're all stupid anyway.  Come on guys, let's go.
Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Boys, Mr. Garrison, fellow students, for our science fair project Bill, Fosse, and I have spawned a creature genetically far superior to man.  I present to you, the five-assed monkey. 
Hey, Phillip. I have to go to Iraq and find my kidnapped daughter.
Sure. You go the same way  except stick your finger up your ass.
What's going on, Phillip? How can Canada have changed so much whilst we were gone?
Ah, I know.  I know he sucks  To be honest, things haven't been going so well lately. I'm not making any money because everyone wants to see Phillip. Why? What the hell does Phillip do?
Oh, that was Sir Smelly. He says 'hello.'
It sure is, Phillip. But I do believe this steer I'm riding has the farts. 
You son of a bitch! You paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game?!
Yes. We can get satellite feed from the U.S. and watch all their stupid T.V. shows.
