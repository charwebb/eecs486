Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass.
No, Phillip, I really thought I did everything. Until I- tried to do it alone. 
I don't know, Phillip. It looks like the alien species here breathe an inert gas.
Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he's not showing up! 
Well, we just can't sit here and eat Kraft Dinner and let Canada be overrun by the Turks! 
No! It's Sally. She's being held captive in Iran.
Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!
Look, buddih, me and Phillip need to go home for a bit.
You cheating bastards.  This isn't over, just wait until tomorrow.
It sure did, Phillip.  Oh, wait. That is the phone.  Hello?
No. No, Phillip, don't say it. I was an asshole, and this is mostly my fault.
Because I had an itch up my ass. 
But this is taking too long, and Phillip is diabetic.
Very nice place you have here. Network must be paying you well.
No it isn't.  Wanna see what's on the inside of me? 
Phillip and I are going to Iran to find her, but we may never return.
Well, let us board the subway and return home. There we can eat Kraft Dinner!
And now, for some classic Terrance and Phillip comedy! 
But Family Guy is going to show Mohammad on an episode that airs tonight!
Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay?
No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore. 
Sure. You go the same way  except stick your finger up your ass.
Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better. 
Ahh, listen, ahh, we've been talking it over, and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing.
Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly.
The good news is, you have a clean bill of health.
Oh, Phillip, you saved me from the gas chamber. 
I may be fat but at least I didn't get hair plugs!
It sure is, Phillip. But I do believe this steer I'm riding has the farts. 
You know I never turn down Kroff Dinner, Phillip.  I'm going to put on a pirate costume. 
You replaced our show with this?! But they aren't funny! All they do is queef all the time!
I'm here, Sally. It's your father, Terrance.  I'm here to save you from your smelly Arabian captors.
That sure was fun, Phillip. Let's go home and eat Kraft Dinner.
Could you please keep it down? We're trying to have sex over here.
Well, I guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad.
Oh, yes. Didn't I mention that, me hearty?
Oh, Phillip. How will we ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place? We don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers, and we have no idea where to begin.
Is there a penny stuck in my butt?
Yes. We can get satellite feed from the U.S. and watch all their stupid T.V. shows.
God no!  Oh, Phillip, your anthrax has given me colon cancer!
Yes.  If people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are.
Yes. See this X-ray?  That's your ass. See this line?  That's your ass collapsing. Your ass is collapsing.
Oh, that was Sir Smelly. He says 'hello.'
Well. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip. 
Right, the guy that drank his own urine.
Oh wait, I have another call on, Scott. Can you hold on?
Huh, eh,  wait wait wait.  Eh, eh.  Here it comes, ehhhh.  Daaaah, I crapped in my pants!
Because you've reduced Canada Channel to smut and toilet humor!
ALL RIGHT, JUST WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE??!!
Hey dumbasses.  You morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet?
Sure you can, Ugly Bob. If they can't see how horribly disfigured you are, they'll want to sleep with you.
Terrific! We need two tickets for Tehran, please.
You've got a man over, don't you, Celine Dion?!
Because I'm suddenly finding myself strangely attracted to Katherine.
Phillip, I think I may have accidentally killed Celine Dion.
Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Boys, Mr. Garrison, fellow students, for our science fair project Bill, Fosse, and I have spawned a creature genetically far superior to man.  I present to you, the five-assed monkey. 
By Friday, we're gonna clone a whole human being.  Good luck with your stupid little pig.
You didn't build a mobile game, you built an addiction machine!
Hey Phillip, would you like to eat some beans.
I must take my bastard daughter back to Celine Dion and see what she has to say.
Sure thing, Phillip.  Ah ha ha ha, you got me again! 
My God, you're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob.
Hurgh, urgh.  Damn it! Pull really hard, Phillip!
Ah, I know.  I know he sucks  To be honest, things haven't been going so well lately. I'm not making any money because everyone wants to see Phillip. Why? What the hell does Phillip do?
Sure, buddy! All you need to do is go down to the , and that's how you  get to the auto garage!
Jesus Christ! That was fast! Well, what should we name it? How about Jerry?
Hey, they've got our clone.  He belongs to us.
Yes, indeed.  But now my little Sally is being held captive in Iran.  And I will have to go and find her.
My doing?? These kids called me and said it was your idea and that you wanted to apologize.
Celine, I brought our daughter Sally back, and I want to tell you that--
I don't think I can do it, Phillip. 
They're all stupid anyway.  Come on guys, let's go.
Yes, Phillip. I'm making a case for our defense. 
Halfway? Then all you've got is a stupid pig.
Say, Phillip, I have a question for you.
Well, now that I have my bastard daughter back, I feel like going to Celine Dion's house and asking her to marry me again.
Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea.
How are we all feeling tonight? Pretty good? Uh oh.  Hey, do you all remember this one? "Doctor, doctor. I think I cracked my ass." "Reallih? Let me take a look." "Look closer." 
OOOH! Sure! Just stick your finger up my ass.
All right, enough with the queefing! We didn't come for a social call!
Shiver me timbers, Phillip! At this rate I'll never get to my Kraft Dinner!  Oh my God!
Hello Mohammad, we've read all aboat you in the Koran.
Hurgh-rrh. Waiwait, wait wait. Hrhrhrhrh. Aha! Hr-rhrh. Oh my! Yeee-aaa!  Hurh. Uhwaiwait. Ye-aauraah-  Caught you there!
Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news.
And now here's a classic Terrance and Phillip sketch that I wrote back in '62. 
Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, "Hey, where's Phillip?" Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK!  You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines!
That's called a monkey claw because it feels like my colon is being ripped apart by a thousand monkeys!
I'm sorry, Scott. Could you hold on a minute?
Oh, Phillip, now you farted during the closing argument!
Oh no Phillip, looks like you're about to fart.
Wroong. We've already got our human clone well under way. 
Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!
HA! Goood luck getting Phillip! He left because he wanted to do  "more serious" stuff. Last I heard, he was doing Canadian Shakespeare in Toronto.
Wrong! She's been taken hostage, and is now being held prisoner.
Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids.  What do you want, an autograph or something?
We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope.
Oh Celine Dion. You never finished that national anthem.
What's going on, Phillip? How can Canada have changed so much whilst we were gone?
Crap. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip.
We did it, Phillip! We destroyed the Turks!
Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart.
Hey, Phillip. Isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town?
It sure does Phillip. No one will oppress our religion here. 
Hold on a minute! Wait just a second!  We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars!
Well. Phillip, I am very sad that we have to die for Canada.
Ogh, whatever.  The point is, Phillip and I are through.  And apparently, so is the act. And so is the money.
Oh. Well. It all began fif-teen years ago.
Well, in that case, I'd say you four boys are up Fart Creek without a paddle. 
Oh, Celine Dion, what have you done? I was going to make us a family again, but now you've slept with Ugly Bob!
Say, Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week.
Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like?
You're at the auto garage. I am the mechanic.
Yes, we have dad. My very own human clone.
