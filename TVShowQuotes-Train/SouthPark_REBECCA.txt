You thought you should be number one?

Oho Wendy, we're done with that list.

He-ey, would you like to come up to my room?

He-ey, baby. Come s-see me later, 'kay? 

Oh, you mean a-a mate. When it is time to increase the herd, my provider will select one for me.

"Littoral."  L I T O R A L

Guh what's in a name? 

I...  have looked at it.

Oh, heavens, no.

I have to extricate a rr-region in his cerebral cortex, or risk ih-nfection to the synaptic responses.

I guess. Are you gonna go? Maybe I'll see you there.

And woowhat is love?

"Litoral." Will you please use it in a sentence?

Hel-lo.

Hi, guys. 

Wow. Wow, that was fun! 

Oh, hel-lo.

If it pleases and sparkles I suggest we continue deliberations on List 47D: Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse?

Oh God, you guys are pathetic!

How can children go to school on a f-licker of light?

Should we...  l-look it up?

Oh, I'm sure Father will give me a ride. 

Woowould you like to come up to my room?

Woowhat means "ki-iss"?

Huhlo? 

"Litoral." Deh-finition?

Hey, Kyle. Wanna go make out?

Uh of course. You taped it to my dog; how could I not see it?

Wha-y noh-ot?  Isn't Papa's garden beautiful? He works so hard on it. 

You certainly come from a silly place. Still, I should like to try that... kiss.  So I cold write about it.  How do we do it?

Oh, hey Wendy.

Hhm. Alright, I guess I'll go.

I'm... having... fun, Mark.
