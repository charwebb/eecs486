Uh of course. You taped it to my dog; how could I not see it?

He-ey, baby. Come s-see me later, 'kay? 

Oho Wendy, we're done with that list.

Woowould you like to come up to my room?

Oh, hel-lo.

Oh God, you guys are pathetic!

"Litoral." Will you please use it in a sentence?

Should we...  l-look it up?

Oh, I'm sure Father will give me a ride. 

Wow. Wow, that was fun! 

I have to extricate a rr-region in his cerebral cortex, or risk ih-nfection to the synaptic responses.

All right, you need to stop. Digging. Around, Wendy!  You might not like... what you find!  Just back off and stop asking questions!  You're getting close to a secret that I don't think you can handle! Let it... go! 

You thought you should be number one?

Hhm. Alright, I guess I'll go.

Wha-y noh-ot?  Isn't Papa's garden beautiful? He works so hard on it. 

Oh, hey Wendy.

Hel-lo.

I...  have looked at it.

If it pleases and sparkles I suggest we continue deliberations on List 47D: Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse?

Well, what else would one do?

Oh, you mean a-a mate. When it is time to increase the herd, my provider will select one for me.

I guess. Are you gonna go? Maybe I'll see you there.

He-ey, would you like to come up to my room?

Woowhat means "ki-iss"?

"Litoral." Deh-finition?

"Littoral."  L I T O R A L

Hey, Kyle. Wanna go make out?

Guh what's in a name? 

How can children go to school on a f-licker of light?

Y-you bet your sweet a-ass I will.

You certainly come from a silly place. Still, I should like to try that... kiss.  So I cold write about it.  How do we do it?

Oh, heavens, no.

I'm... having... fun, Mark.
