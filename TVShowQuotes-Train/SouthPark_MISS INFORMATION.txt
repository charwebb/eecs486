Mrs. Broflovski's son is a little sick. Perhaps she could bring him in tomorrow and you could give him some spiritual healing.
Why don't you follow me over to the cash register and I'll take a deposit. 
Mrs. Broflovski, I would like to give your son herbs that focus on the kidney. I have these excellent herbs from local Native Americans.
Now, don't be fooled. As Kyle's body sheds itself more and more of all the toxins he will appear to be getting worse, but actually, he is getting better!
Yes. He really needs his toxins flushed again.
You see, the reason our body is stale is because of toxins.
Nono, that's good. Those are the toxins flushing out of the system.
Oh, look everyone. These are our two resident Native Americans. Chief Running Pinto, and Carlos Ramirez. 
Well, of course the doctor told you that, because he wants to make money. Holistic medicine is about NATURE.  Two-hundred and thirty-three dollars. 
Yes, his chi is flowing much nicer than yesterday, and his aura is lighter.
All the horrible food we eatâ€”the sodas and meats are filled with toxins, and the only way for us to get better is to flush those toxins out of our system. Western medicine is so quick to cut and carve up, but all your son needs is a toxin-flushing diet of lemon juice and cayenne pepper.
Native Americans are more in tune with the earth than we are.
Huuuuuuuuuh  Oh, I don't agree. He seems much better.
