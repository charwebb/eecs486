Where the hell do you think you're going?
You know what the goo is worth on the open market? Hell, I got people in Hong Kong who'll give me 50 mil for that goo.
So you admit it. There was a cover up. 
Sorry is a four letter word with a y on the end. That doesn't mean anything to this poor kid.
Good to see you Hat. Helluva night, isn't it?
Yeah, the old "Hasn't anything changed?" speech. Works on white people all the time.
You really still believe that garbage? The people in your town sold you that line. Come on, you've had to have doubted it all along. 
You walk away now, and you will regret it the rest of your life.
Look, Mephesto, just tell this kid who his father is and you do it now!
There's a bounty on my head and I can't afford to stay in one place for too long. So long... Denver Bronco.
And that's that. "Pack your bags, you're headed home. Hugs and kisses from Uncle Sam."  So how do I end up here, with a nine year old kid who just wants to know who his father is? Life is funny like that. One day you're sifting through the guts of some gook in Vietnam and the next you're playing Dr. Phil with some kid and his teacher.
You really got yourself in a mess this time, kid.
Then I guess I won't tell you about your father. 
Shut up Kyle, you dumb Jew.  You've got Bronco blood in you, kid. That makes you awesome. Me? I should be movin' on.
Saigon. It's a hell of a place. I've seen a lot of death.  A lot of suffering. Darkness that most people couldn't stand to see.  I tried to sit it out as much as I could. 
If you know what's good for you, you'll keep your mouth shut, kid.
Thought that might get your attention. You know nothing about your dad, right?
Heh. I know all about the swindles and schemes in this dead-end town. You got lied to kid. By the people who were closest to you. I can prove it too, but I'm going to want something in return.
Yeah, but you're forgetting, you're also half Denver Bronco. That makes you pretty cool.
The name's Mitch Conner, I flew the same division as you back in Saigon. 
Think about it. Muhammad is the only person in the world who can't get ripped on. Those celebrities want his goo.
