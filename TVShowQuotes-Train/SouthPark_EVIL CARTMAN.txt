This is amazing! I can't believe how nice you are, Chef.
Who's my kitty? Who's my little kitty? My fluffy little cat. Yeah, that's good, yeah, that's my nice little kitty, yeah. 
In my world, you're a skinny, white insurance salesman. 
Yuh, thanks, you guys. I certainly like you a lot more than in my evil, parallel universe. 
Well, I was just standing around, and Stan and Kyle were being really mean, as usual, and Kenny had just bought a new car.
And sir, can I make a suggestion?  Move your store, and let these great people of the Wampanoag rest in peace.
Oh, no!  Stan and Kyle have come to take my back to my world, and I don't wanna go back!
Listen, friend. You can't sell people pets like this. You have to have a sign that says, "Warning: these fish are from an evil, parallel universe." Now, it's not our fault you disrespected the bodies of this land's native people, but by golly , you're gonna take this fish back.
Come on! I bet that together we can make the best pumpkin ever!
Hey, you guys. We still have time to enter the pumpkin-carving contest.
I don't see any pet stores called "Indian Burial Ground."
