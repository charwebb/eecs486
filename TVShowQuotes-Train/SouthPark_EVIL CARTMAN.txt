Well, I was just standing around, and Stan and Kyle were being really mean, as usual, and Kenny had just bought a new car.
And sir, can I make a suggestion?  Move your store, and let these great people of the Wampanoag rest in peace.
Who's my kitty? Who's my little kitty? My fluffy little cat. Yeah, that's good, yeah, that's my nice little kitty, yeah. 
I don't see any pet stores called "Indian Burial Ground."
I'm sorry I caused so much trouble. This is all very strange to me, too.
In my world, you're a skinny, white insurance salesman. 
Oh, no!  Stan and Kyle have come to take my back to my world, and I don't wanna go back!
Hey, you guys. We still have time to enter the pumpkin-carving contest.
Yuh, thanks, you guys. I certainly like you a lot more than in my evil, parallel universe. 
Come on! I bet that together we can make the best pumpkin ever!
Listen, friend. You can't sell people pets like this. You have to have a sign that says, "Warning: these fish are from an evil, parallel universe." Now, it's not our fault you disrespected the bodies of this land's native people, but by golly , you're gonna take this fish back.
