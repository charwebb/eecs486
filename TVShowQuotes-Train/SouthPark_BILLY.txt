You snitched and told the principal I was smoking.
Two buckets plus a three-piece meal and four sides.
I've got the money to pay for it, but it's become a risky business out there. You get the chicken for me, and I'll make sure you're hooked up for life. Do you wanna do it?
Le's play Battleship! All hands on the poop deck!
See you in the woods tomorrow, dead man! 
...Fine? I'm not making any money here! I'm losing it! I have to pay for more security, I got the cops up my ass, and I have to pay for all these orders to cut the chicken for distribution!
Hold on, hold on.  You're a big boy, Eric. Maybe you can pay me back another way. Do a little job for me. I've got some serious KFC coming in from a dealer. I need somebody willing to get a little risky and... pick it up.
I'm going to bed now, Mommy. I put my tooth under the pillow. Do you really think the tooth fairy will give me money for the transplant?
You're gonna die Mackey!  Hold his legs!  Come back here!
That's alright Eric. I've got something big in the works. What if I told you... that I now have a direct line to get all the KFC we want here? I'm sending Tommy to Kentucky, to try and set up a little "arrangement" with the Colonel himself.
That's right. And I'd like you to go as well and watch Tommy's back for me. Is that something you'd want to do?
What, are you crazy Eric?! Making a deal with the Colonel for ten thousand more boxes?! I can't move that much chicken!
How can I expand when thirty-six percent of our product is going to you?! Get out there and sell the chicken or get lost! You've forgotten who the boss of this operation is, Eric!
You? Gonna fight back? I don't think so! 
You can hide in your house for now, Mackey, but tomorrow is a field trip! Frisco Woods! And I'm gonna do things to you you'll never forget!
Well, I can't wait to feel healthy and strong again.
