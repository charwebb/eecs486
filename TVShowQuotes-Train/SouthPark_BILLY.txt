What, are you crazy Eric?! Making a deal with the Colonel for ten thousand more boxes?! I can't move that much chicken!

Yehahah.

Two buckets plus a three-piece meal and four sides.

I'm going to bed now, Mommy. I put my tooth under the pillow. Do you really think the tooth fairy will give me money for the transplant?

Come on, Mackey. We're waitin' for ya.

You wouldn't do that.

We wanna be in Mackey's group!

The tooth fairy! 

Excellent.

I have my sources. That'll be $85.

Cartman my boy, you got the stuff?

You're gonna die Mackey!  Hold his legs!  Come back here!

I've got the money to pay for it, but it's become a risky business out there. You get the chicken for me, and I'll make sure you're hooked up for life. Do you wanna do it?

Le's play Battleship! All hands on the poop deck!

There he is! Hey, Mackey! 

Okay-y, Mom. 

See you in the woods tomorrow, dead man! 

Mommy, no!

You snitched and told the principal I was smoking.

Heyyy you're good Eric. I need people like you!

Alright Mackey. Take this. 

Come 'ere! 

Suuure.  Jessie. 

That's alright Eric. I've got something big in the works. What if I told you... that I now have a direct line to get all the KFC we want here? I'm sending Tommy to Kentucky, to try and set up a little "arrangement" with the Colonel himself.

Hold on, hold on.  You're a big boy, Eric. Maybe you can pay me back another way. Do a little job for me. I've got some serious KFC coming in from a dealer. I need somebody willing to get a little risky and... pick it up.

Ahhh Eric Cartman, right?

That's right. And I'd like you to go as well and watch Tommy's back for me. Is that something you'd want to do?

Excellent.

G'night, Mom. G'night, Dad.

You can hide in your house for now, Mackey, but tomorrow is a field trip! Frisco Woods! And I'm gonna do things to you you'll never forget!

Duh six hundred dohollars.

Sih, six hundred dollar-. 

...Fine? I'm not making any money here! I'm losing it! I have to pay for more security, I got the cops up my ass, and I have to pay for all these orders to cut the chicken for distribution!

There he is! You can't run forever!

You? Gonna fight back? I don't think so! 

Well, I a-I don't know.
