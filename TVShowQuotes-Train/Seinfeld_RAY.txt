Hey, hey, are you a cop?
Your friend is crazy.
Im talking about the statue.
Whats going on here?
Ive got to get going. I have a class.
Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?
Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning peoples apartments.
What are you talking about?
Ah, the pastries!
What are you saying?
It's all hand made and I love the in-lay.
Im not getting this.
You want her.
Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.
(to Jerry) I hope you think about what youve done here today. And if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me.
Police?
Give it back to whom?
I think you have me confused with somebody else.
Well, this is an unexpected surprise  and delight! The once and future king of comedy, Jerry the First, gracing our humble abode. Rava, were in the presence of royalty.
I cant believe what Im hearing.
And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.
You?
Well, thats because Im registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name.
For your information, I got that statue in a pawn shop.
Give it back?
You are starting to make me angry!
Ah, sweet elixir. Its fragrant nectar a soothing balm for the soul.
Bob.
What did you say?
Are you talking to me?
Yeah, Im coming!
Your palace shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire.
Hey.
Are you saying I stole your statue?
Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you.
Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all.
Got you? I dont even know what the hell youre talking about.
Oh, Jerry. I cant believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you couldve got me into?
I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.
Yes?
Lemon?
Yes.
If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore and have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over.
Look at this.
Who is this?
Yeah.
How about dinner?
Whats behind this? Its Rava, isnt it?
I said, are you talking to me?
