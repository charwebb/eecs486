Im talking about the statue.
Lemon?
If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore and have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over.
Ah, the pastries!
You want her.
I think you have me confused with somebody else.
How about dinner?
Bob.
Police?
Shes from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?!
But I didnt just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life.
Yeah, Im coming!
Are you saying I stole your statue?
I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.
And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.
Ive got to get going. I have a class.
Murder?!
Well, this is an unexpected surprise  and delight! The once and future king of comedy, Jerry the First, gracing our humble abode. Rava, were in the presence of royalty.
Your palace shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire.
Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you.
For your information, I got that statue in a pawn shop.
Are you talking to me?
Im not getting this.
Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all.
Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?
Yeah.
I said, are you talking to me?
What did you say?
I cant believe what Im hearing.
You are starting to make me angry!
I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the pastries were the food of the gods.
(to Jerry) I hope you think about what youve done here today. And if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me.
Who is this?
Whats going on here?
Yes?
What are you talking about?
Hey.
Well, thats because Im registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name.
Look at this.
Yes.
What are you saying?
Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.
Your friend is crazy.
Oh, Jerry. I cant believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you couldve got me into?
It's all hand made and I love the in-lay.
You?
Whats behind this? Its Rava, isnt it?
Ah, sweet elixir. Its fragrant nectar a soothing balm for the soul.
Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning peoples apartments.
