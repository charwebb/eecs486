Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all.
Shes from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?!
Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning peoples apartments.
(to Jerry) I hope you think about what youve done here today. And if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me.
It's all hand made and I love the in-lay.
Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.
Oh, Jerry. I cant believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you couldve got me into?
Well, this is an unexpected surprise  and delight! The once and future king of comedy, Jerry the First, gracing our humble abode. Rava, were in the presence of royalty.
And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.
Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?
But I didnt just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life.
I think you have me confused with somebody else.
Your palace shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire.
Ive got to get going. I have a class.
I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the pastries were the food of the gods.
If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore and have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over.
For your information, I got that statue in a pawn shop.
I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.
Ah, sweet elixir. Its fragrant nectar a soothing balm for the soul.
Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you.
