I said, are you talking to me?
Look at this.
Im not getting this.
Whats behind this? Its Rava, isnt it?
It's all hand made and I love the in-lay.
Im talking about the statue.
I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.
I think you have me confused with somebody else.
Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.
Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you.
How about dinner?
Give it back to whom?
Well, thats because Im registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name.
Who is this?
Do you take sugar?
Yeah, Im coming!
Ah, the pastries!
You are starting to make me angry!
(to Jerry) I hope you think about what youve done here today. And if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me.
If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore and have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over.
Well, this is an unexpected surprise  and delight! The once and future king of comedy, Jerry the First, gracing our humble abode. Rava, were in the presence of royalty.
You?
Ive got to get going. I have a class.
Lemon?
Hey.
What are you talking about?
Murder?!
Oh, Jerry. I cant believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you couldve got me into?
Yeah.
Whats going on here?
You want her.
I cant believe what Im hearing.
Your friend is crazy.
Give it back?
Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?
Bob.
And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.
Yes.
But I didnt just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life.
Are you saying I stole your statue?
For your information, I got that statue in a pawn shop.
Police?
What are you saying?
Your palace shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire.
Hey, hey, are you a cop?
Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all.
Are you talking to me?
What did you say?
Shes from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?!
