For your information, I got that statue in a pawn shop.
(to Jerry) I hope you think about what youve done here today. And if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me.
It's all hand made and I love the in-lay.
Ive got to get going. I have a class.
I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.
Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?
I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the pastries were the food of the gods.
Your palace shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire.
Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning peoples apartments.
I think you have me confused with somebody else.
Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you.
Well, thats because Im registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name.
If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore and have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over.
Well, this is an unexpected surprise  and delight! The once and future king of comedy, Jerry the First, gracing our humble abode. Rava, were in the presence of royalty.
Got you? I dont even know what the hell youre talking about.
Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.
Oh, Jerry. I cant believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you couldve got me into?
Ah, sweet elixir. Its fragrant nectar a soothing balm for the soul.
But I didnt just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life.
And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.
