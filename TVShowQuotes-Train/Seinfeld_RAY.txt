Im talking about the statue.
Your palace shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire.
It's all hand made and I love the in-lay.
For your information, I got that statue in a pawn shop.
Give it back to whom?
Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning peoples apartments.
Police?
You want her.
Are you saying I stole your statue?
Ah, the pastries!
And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.
I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the pastries were the food of the gods.
Well, thats because Im registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name.
Im not getting this.
Who is this?
Look at this.
I think you have me confused with somebody else.
Well, this is an unexpected surprise  and delight! The once and future king of comedy, Jerry the First, gracing our humble abode. Rava, were in the presence of royalty.
Ah, sweet elixir. Its fragrant nectar a soothing balm for the soul.
What are you talking about?
Yeah.
Your friend is crazy.
Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you.
Murder?!
Oh, Jerry. I cant believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you couldve got me into?
Shes from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?!
Ive got to get going. I have a class.
Whats behind this? Its Rava, isnt it?
Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.
What did you say?
I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.
But I didnt just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life.
Hey, hey, are you a cop?
Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?
Hey.
Give it back?
Got you? I dont even know what the hell youre talking about.
Do you take sugar?
Yes?
How about dinner?
I said, are you talking to me?
Whats going on here?
Lemon?
(to Jerry) I hope you think about what youve done here today. And if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me.
You?
Yes.
What are you saying?
You are starting to make me angry!
Are you talking to me?
