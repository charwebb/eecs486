(Peppy) Well, here I am!
You know I really do look like your friend Jerry.
No, no.. It's just a little performance piece I wrote... You know what? You really inspired me,oKay, a tear.
(Serious) No, no, I mean it. You're very funny.
Jerry!
(Setting the box down on his table) Actually, the seat next to me was empty, so, there was no problem at all.
That's right. It's a special gourmet sauce. "The Pride of Memphis!"
(nods) Hehumm!!
Hello.
Oh well, I'll be watching. (Sets the doll down, then crosses her fingers) Don't screw up. (Leaves)
This is much better. And frankly, in Memphis, we think that other sauce as (Whispering) kind of a joke.
No, but he should be home soon.
Hey there, Mr. Hairy legs!
Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for the free tickets. You are so funny.
Oh, anyway, let me show you Memphis. I am taking you (Points to him) out to dinner.
Ohh.. that's too bad.. Susan thought we'd really get along - I guess because we're both wacko! (Jerry laughs) You know what, um.. (Turns around, picking up a large gift from a table) You have to give this to them for me. Okay? Here. (Hands the box to Jerry, he struggles under the size of it) It's a wedding present.
Right!, Yesss!! Thank you I'm gonna do it. (starts to eat her food)
