Hello?
(Through the intercom) It's Sally.
No, but he should be home soon.
Well...That is the title.
Jerry, sorry I'm late. Channel Nine is doing a piece on my show. Isn't that great? Do you hate me?
(Gasps) Don't worry. (Like a detective) I'm on the case.
Ok so I go to meet Jerry Seinfeld at this horrible coffee shop right? And he's like "Hey stop doing your show." and I'm like, Hello! It's a free country. So then he goes." Okay Shmootsie" and he starts pulling at my sweater right?. He's getting, you know, Hands Across America.
Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for the free tickets. You are so funny.
..OK get this; I heard he makes his best friend date women that look just like him.Hello issues..
Well, lay it on me string bean.
(Setting the box down on his table) Actually, the seat next to me was empty, so, there was no problem at all.
That's right. It's a special gourmet sauce. "The Pride of Memphis!"
No, no.. It's just a little performance piece I wrote... You know what? You really inspired me,oKay, a tear.
Jerry!
You could just do your material.
(Serious) No, no, I mean it. You're very funny.
(Peppy) Well, here I am!
Don't worry, I brought your doll.. (Pulls out an extremely different doll - this one resembles a baker) Tada!
Really?
Okay. (turns around and walks out with an exaggerated swing of her hips)
Oh, anyway, let me show you Memphis. I am taking you (Points to him) out to dinner.
Oh well, I'll be watching. (Sets the doll down, then crosses her fingers) Don't screw up. (Leaves)
(on TV) Master of Evil Jerry Seinfeld has broke off all contacts with me.
Yeah! You've been stinking since the Eighties.
Oh and speaking of issues . Guess who got a no-polish manicure and begged his neighbor not to tell anyone?
You know I workshopped that and.. SNOOZERS!!! he he he....but I'll tell you what I'll think... It's all a journey.
A whole case.
Ohh.. that's too bad.. Susan thought we'd really get along - I guess because we're both wacko! (Jerry laughs) You know what, um.. (Turns around, picking up a large gift from a table) You have to give this to them for me. Okay? Here. (Hands the box to Jerry, he struggles under the size of it) It's a wedding present.
Jerry, I saw the doll you were talking about - not funny! This doll's much funnier. Look, it has a little bowtie, and a cute little hat.. I think it's a riot!
(nods) Hehumm!!
(joining Kramer) Hey! Your Jerry's friend. You're Goofy, mind if I sit. My show is going really well. Have you seen it yet? you should. Everybody else have and you know what? I got recognized the other day, How weird is that. I know . At first I liked the attention but it's like Whoa!! take three steps back, Get a life, okay. but then there wouldn't be a Sally Weaver without the fans, know what I mean. But who am I? anyway. I mean there's Sally weaver the woman, Sally Weaver the artist, Sally Weaver the person...
Right!, Yesss!! Thank you I'm gonna do it. (starts to eat her food)
This is much better. And frankly, in Memphis, we think that other sauce as (Whispering) kind of a joke.
