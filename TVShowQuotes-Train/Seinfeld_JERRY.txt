I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship?
Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.
Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?
Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.
Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money?
Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.
Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back
Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?!
Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.
No, nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table)
H-Hey, Kramer, wait up. I'll go with you.
We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.
Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.
Have you ever spent any time with these people...?
Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again)
I know exactly whats gonna happen tonight. Im gonna try and act like Im not impressed, hes gonna see right through it.
Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?
I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it.
That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.
He is merry, I'll give him that. (notices a cactus on the table) What's this plant for?
(Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.
People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.
Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, "Those aren't buoys." (Father starts laughing) Father...
Whenever I see the news and they're hauling in some kind of terrorist, psycho, maniac, mass murderer guy. You notice he's always covering up his face with the newspaper, with the jacket, with the hat. What is he worried about? I mean what is this man's reputation? That he has to worry about this kind of exposure damaging his good name? I mean, what is he up for a big job promotion down at the office or something? Afraid the boss is gonna catch this on TV and go "isn't that Johnson from sales? He's up in that clock tower picking people off one by one. I don't know if that's that kind of man we want heading up that new branch office. He should be in bill collection. I think he's got aptitude."
You're passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago!
(Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.
Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.
So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles.
Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)
Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?
(Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this.
What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must be something. What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks?
Of course I want to talk about it.
That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.
I'm sorry, Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen)
Thats different. I didnt have feelings for those people. But you, youll backslide
(Gestures to his forehead) Youre getting that vein again.
(Pointing) But are you still master of your domain?
Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.)
All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---
Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.
Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip.
I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?
Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat!
(walking out) Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody.
Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school.
It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!
It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.
You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.
We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
Uh, you know, why dont you go first, you just had a long trip.
(to Elaine) So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?
I said I couldnt believe you liked that commercial. So what?
Well. (calling down the hall) Call if you're gonna be late!
I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)
I don't need a reason to give gifts, it's my nature. I love to make people happy.
Well, if I hear an anguished "oink", I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look (HE POINTS AT PASSERBY) Human, human, human... (HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR, WITH ALARM.) (WITH MOCK ALARM) Wait a second! (Grabs Kramer)
If I see her, what do I say that Im doing here in the building?
No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!
(To Assistant) I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?
Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?
Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain?
So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club.
(Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.
What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.
Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...
Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.
No. We gotta go to the soup place.
Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.
Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched voice) Gone.
Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)
He bothers me. I dont even answer the phone anymore because of him. Hes turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.
It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?
So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?
I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.
No, no. Still doin the big sweep across.
It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?
(Trying to explain) Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past.
I dont think so. You know they, theyre so fragile.
Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.
Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.
Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.
Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!
(taking a catalog) Can I have one? I need one of those old-looking phones. So you wanna grab a bite?
He can't just throw me off the plane!
You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!
Hey. Why didn't cha get the big one?
"No no you said George likes spicy chicken."
I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes.
[with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?!
What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of temperament?
yeah yeah what is it with you and Tony? what are you? it's like his sidekick now?
Youre movin in, youre a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars. (Elaine is shocked, Jerry opens the door to the hall.) Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I dont even wanna see it, go, get it out.
So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. Its a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and Im supposed to feel bad. Is that the way its supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldnt you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. Cause its not easy to give someone the toe, youve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... (Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) Look at that toe, buddy. (He puts his foot down.) I mean, thats really insulting to get the toe, isnt it?
All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.
Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.
So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box.
George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods)
Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere... I got my bags, I'm ready to go.
Ah, dinner! Thats it, youre all the way back!
Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?
Oh, what do you think? I found it at the back of my closet.
(opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.
I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.
What the hell...? Why is the door open?
Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.
40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?
My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? (to the intercom)
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.
Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things about you from George.
You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal(sp?) before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.
I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something!
So were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.
On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!
Aw.. right, code of silence.. how's that going?....Ha!!...
Oh, no don't say that. You'll jinx me.
Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?
(as Kristin is storming out) Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?
You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.
Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. Its the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... (Jerry pushes the door shut.) ...MUST BE CLOSED!!
Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?
Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!
(shaking his head no) No Kramer I don't want to talk to him.
I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.
You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.
Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.
I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.
So, you would date a married guy? That's so hacky.
Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump across.
I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.
(uncertain) Don't you hire people to do that?
(Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 'French Impressionist Paintings'?
I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect.
Great talkin' to you. (Nina leaves. To himself) What the hell is e-mail?
I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.
All right. That's it, I can't work like this.
The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too.
Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.
How much was it to clean the vest?
(Noting) You know, I've never seen you drive.
No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.
Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?
Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.
Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?
Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying "mickey"!
I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?
Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.
Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly.
Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!
(to himself) Hoh, that Milos. (to Patty) Well uh, what shall we do, uhm, care for a cup of coffee?
I hear you're going out with David Putty.
(out of window) George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!
That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice.
Yeah... hes specializing in whales. He's working on lowering the cholesterol level, in whales all that blubber -- quite unhealthy. You know its the largest mammal on earth but as George says "they don't have to be."
Oh, man, look at this mess! You know what's gonna happen if they see this?
The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California!
Well, this is it. I'm really gonna do something about my life, you know? You know, I think I'm gonna call Melanie again. So what if she shushed me. GEORGE, I am really gonna make some changes.
Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions.
Oh, about the... uh (Jerry pretend to wash his hands)
(imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape?
What, your sad little horsies, the house with the little curl of smoke, the sunflower with the smiley face. the transparent cube... (as she leaves)
Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?
(on the phone) Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.
Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???
So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?
Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, "Why knock my brains out?"
I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.
If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?
On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?
Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.
(cutting in) I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman.
You see the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around, but they don't know they're ugly, because nobody actually tells them.
Yeah, I cant eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I cant dance.
No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!
Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him)
Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...
What are you looking at? (Kramer goes out onto the terrace and looks down.) Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold.
Toilet brush, oh (he pulls a 'Damn, shoulda guessed!' face). Alright, I can replace that.
Well, you want to sit with George? I think he's coming with Robin.
How long are you suppose to leave it on for?
He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything.
That was Elaine , she changed her mind. She's not coming over.
It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!
I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit) And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.
I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.
What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?
I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.
So lemme ask you this how long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night.
What did you have to give your TV away to George for?
Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.
I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I? (throws coat over his right shoulder)
The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting out that marriage.
You're out of your mind you know that.
What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these, like Superman? I've got to unlock this mystery.
Oh, like you know what you're talking about!
(grunting as he throws bread into the air)
I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I dont know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because its really not a definite thing yet. (crowd cheers him on to tell them) Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that Ive received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. (audience applauds) Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didnt even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, thats what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, You may have already won. Id like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, You have definitely lost! You turn it over, giant printing, Not even close! You open it up, theres this whole letter of explanation, Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest.
Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.
The old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go "how do you like crotch?" If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly.
I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.
Hey, I called you last night, where were you?
Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this?
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!
Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll *all* be over...
Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?
I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.
I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.
So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.
I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldnt do that.
Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.
Im worried I wont be able to talk to him. Hes such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.
(Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.
Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee)
She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?
Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.
I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.
I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.
A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?
Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!
(to George) All right, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend Im disappointed. Youre going to really see me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this. Maybe you should go in the other room.
(accusing) You're not wearing a shirt, are you?
Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.
(walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!
It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.
First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.
I don't think I can be that nice.
Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.
I dont know. Theyve been in there since, like, World War II. The rents three hundred a month.
So what do you have to say for yourself?
C'mon up. (To George) Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'
What happened you didn't give her the papers?
What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I dont even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. Thats what I want. I want an admission of guilt.
I don't care, why are you telling me this?
Do you want to go with him? You go. I dont mind.
I've been waiting a while for this. You know it's a shame Tony got all banged up, we're not gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.
So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?
These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin' to make that call! (George comes in)
Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. Weve been doing this silly, dumb voice.
Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?
Yeah, but this is different , this is like ,you know, semi digested food stuff. You know the next stop is the stomach and you can take it from there.
Good question. (More to himself than to Elaine) Why are we calling?
It has nothing to do with her sister.
(acidly) Shes full. So, Big Daddy. Im just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?
(trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents.
(on the phone) hey Andre, get the hell off the phone!
Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?
Thats comforting. Shh. Hes coming. (to Ray) Ray?
Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys.
Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you... (catches himself)
(Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say "Hi", and I say "Hello".
Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
(Reading from his notebook) I got You enter, you go "Hi", and I go, "Hello." Now.. we need something here..
Hey, could you do me a favour? [pause] Could you shut-up?
Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..
Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone to ghost read it.
It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.
Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.)
(Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there.
Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog strangler. (George leans close) would you suck a mint or something. Can I come right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where we are. Where are we?
The fabric of society is very complex George.
How about we leave and, come back in a week?
..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Packyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of (wipes his brow) pizza and uh the uh and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling em (does juggling motions) he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. (Swallows and takes a breath) Well we all just lost it. (Fulton not laughing, stone faced) It was really really funny.
They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations.
Oh, its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.
So I know this guy. Im getting all my sneakers at a discount now.
Id rather not say it out loud. Its embarrassing.
(Still pulling on Kramer's pants from the ankles) Man these are tight. (Yanking) Squinch your hips in
No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.
(Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.
What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?
Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.
So she kicked him out of the apartment.
You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't remember anything about you.
Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.
(picking up the phone and dialing) It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.
No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I wouldve said tonight.
Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.
(Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?
Yeah, big missing goin' on (spreads arms wide)
Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.
I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.
Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.
Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?
Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.
I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've been so helpful.
Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodations. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats.
We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
No. We both just saw the same monkey.
Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door)
Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.
Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.
No more crutches, that must be a relief.
Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.
Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.
Yeah. a-hu. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?
You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.
Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.
(Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..
Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you (throws the bottle to Kramer.)
I couldnt tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that
Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino.
Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.
That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is.
(putting the phone back to his ear) Yeah.
Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.
(Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?
Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage from her yet!
Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry won't let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesnt that bother you?
Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president James Polk!" (ELAINE had echoed "Uh-huh. Yup." during it)
Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
How do you stop a kid from growing?
My bet? All right. Ill open with a tuna sandwich.
No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.
Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.
All right. You know this girl Clare I am seeing?
Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.
Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful.
Hey, lll just keep swimming. Hey, hey. Im not done. I know what you're up to Ramon. Because Im a member here, this is my place to swim.
You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.
Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.
She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.
Well, we've got to do something. (grabs his phone) I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.
You're pretty comfortable up there eh, Bubble boy?
All right, do you want the quarter, take the quarter, but don't try and tell me it's yours.
(beginning to cough and struggle) Getting weak... Losing power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing without me. Nothing!
All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? (sits opposite George)
Well you're not even a fan. I was at game six - you didn't even watch it.
Well, I dont really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.
(emphatic) I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!
So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.
No, no. Its not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, its not like Marlenes a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, weve had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling. (George nods.) And its these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if Im busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and shes in the middle of a sentence!
And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my...
Yes, come on! How often do you get engaged? Come on!
Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry pushes his door against Kramer's entrance]
This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!
I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.
I thought we were going to the movies?
I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.
No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
I think it has something to do with me.
I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there.
I don't know, but you don't have it.
Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.
Hey, do you know what the Whip does?
It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.
You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.
Well, good night [holds hand out and shakes hand]
Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen "Girlie" Brown would be very proud of you.
I don't like this Kramer. Will it be much longer?
Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.
Yeah Ive got this old bottle of cough medicine.
I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.
But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!
I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
You didn't ... (makes motion like he's lighting a cigar)
Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.
Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.
(walking over the the buzzer to answer it) Oh, that's the Flicks.
No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.
Great. One of the best jobs I ever had.
I don't know what you should do with it.
All right. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle Arbys no more than once a month. And in exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game, and doesnt read a book.
You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.
When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!
(ironic outrage) The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!
George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.
Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.
Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car so I don't toss it in that dumpster?
Why don't you go to another nail shop?
What are you bringing snowballs in here for?
Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.
I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.
You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.
Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.
You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown?
In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.
I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?
Well I thought we'd both be getting married.
Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?
Nothing. I'm sure "Jon" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! (Laughs uproariously.)
You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!
Well, thats a lot of money. But, if thats the way its gotta be, thats the way its gotta be.
What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.
She was looking for someone to go to the show with.
What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't respect salad eaters.
(Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying.
Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I never know what to write on these things. I hate doin' this.
They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys.
(to Kramer) So how's your karate class going?
That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.
Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town.
Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?
I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?
(Fishing for his keys in a kitchen drawer) You know, when I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time.
Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up)
You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.
That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.
Are you sure? Oh boy, here we go.
I think theres a mental hospital near here.
You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.
Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.
I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.
Ill call him. (Jerry picks up the cordless phone. He points to the rotary phone on the coffee table. Kramer, George, and Elaine struggle for it.) Hello, Ray?... Hi, Ray, this is Ravas friend, Elaines friend, Jerry... The King of Comedy, right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? (He covers the reciever and yells at Kramer and George.) Would you shut up?! (to the phone) Yeah, you dont want to talk about it over the phone?.. You dont want Rava to hear?... Yeah, I understand... You know that coffee shop near my house, Monks?... All right, tomorrow... One o clock... Great, okay, bye.
Elaine its her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back.
Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.
Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes outside)
(pause) I thought you said... "ridicurous." (Donna looks puzzled)
Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket.
Make sure you get this area here, where he needs the help....
Women need to like the job of the guy theyre with. If they dont like the job, they dont like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. Well, right now, Im the regional management supervisor. Im in development, research, consulting... Men on the other hand  if they are physically attracted to a woman  are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men dont really care. Menll just go, Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? Youre just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why dont you shower up, and well get some burgers and catch a movie.
Gina, do you know what a Drakes Coffee Cake is?
I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different... sources.
Since when are you treating me to medicine? What are you doing? You're stealing this, aren't you?
hunky.. Tony.. hey hey hey (fools around with his collar again)
Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. "I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa " Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... (Naomi exits) it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality.
I cant believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.
(Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So we're on for later?
You want to get something to eat first?
(Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat.
No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.
Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?
My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?
Im gonna make an appointment for you. Well go together.
I don't know. So what's this job of yours?
Oh, no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down. (George & Jerry each slide to the end of their booth seats)
(Disgusted. To the woman) Oh, come on. You know he's a postman, don't ya?
But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
Elaine, he's a.. he's a male bimbo, he's a mimbo
How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? Wha, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just sit there going, "Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh, no, another headcase!"
Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
Elaine, how about this shirt? Is this okay?
What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it.
What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp, why do you want shade?
Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, "Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land." (Imitates cannon operator) "I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you."
Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?
Krame? Sein. What are you doing? Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island. What are your thoughts about taking a ride? You sure? Okay, but don't leave me hanging here. Okay, great. Let me give you directions.
I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work.
Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? To me tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. "That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh."
Oh yeah, Sfuzi? I- I've gotta do that.
Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.
NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.
Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?
I don't even think you could do it.
I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.
Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent. It's very boring.
I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?
Alright, I'll change my shoes. (Heads back to his apartment. George follows.)
Well, what kind of a kiss? Was it a peck? Was it a kiss? Was it a long make out thing?
(taking off his jacket) Slaughtered. Wiped the floor with 'em and (hanging up jacket) not only that, the money was unbelievable.
(Reading it) "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." - What is that?
I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! **
What are you doing? Were going out for dinner in ten minutes.
No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.
There you go. That'll get you home in time.
Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didnt want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And its been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. (to Kramer) All right, so, just take what you want and lets get it out of here.
(picks up the phone on the coffee table) 555-3455. Well wait a second, don't you see that's 555-FILK.
I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.
That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.
(To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.
(testing Joel) So, Im thinking about going to Iran this summer.
You're still trying to gget that free sub?
(smiling with pleasure) You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile.
(facing the lengthening line behind him) Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.
Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?
Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.
Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department.
By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?
I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! No!!! Thank you. (Hangs up.) I don't believe this. They've added Bania to the network showcase and he's going on right after me.
What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do whatever it is you do. You disgust me.
(Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven!
Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips.
(walking towards door with Elaine) How long did you last? (opens door)
First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.
All I said was "I like the pen".
I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.
Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours. (And with that, Jerry made the most fatal mistake of his life)
Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?
Yeah thats a good deal -- you win the Pennant with that trade, hair for phlegm.
Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.
Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!
Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.
Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.
Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.
All right, just give me a western. (unhappy)
I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. "Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life." Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, "I had a heart attack this big (Holds out hands, gesturing bigness) ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear! (Puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest) Brrhht.. and it's gone!"
(extemporising) Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was registered under Slappy White.
I don't know how I feel about it.
I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!
Understand you had a little talk with him too.
You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.
Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...
(Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing?
All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?
If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.
So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?
An old friend of mine, whom you may have met, George Costanza, has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formally a highly placed official with an outfit known as the IRS. And as we speak, at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information. And she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise.
I'll get you another one just like it!
Look at this, my ankle's all bitten up.
It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse "ha's." You know those?
Turn up the heat in your apartment! (opens a window)
Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.
Well, once I didnt have dinner until, like 900 oclock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage  meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya? Throw out my garbage for me.
I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
(leaving) You two keep an eye on each other?
Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?
You cant have that coat, it's not yours.
well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.
Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet?
(Hands him some mail) There you go. Merry Chirstmas!
(Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here.
(in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.
Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!
I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?
Now, I should tell you that, at this point, she's under the impression that youre - a - ah
Oh, I cant begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.
I didnt know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrants going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesnt make sense. Am I wrong?
(seeing Fredo's tombstone) Oh, my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up! (hands the shovel to Kramer)
Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?
You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
All right! Take it easy! Take it easy.
(Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.
(very disinterested) Hum... ok, what else you got?
Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!
(on phone)Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.... it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye.
Hello is this Alicia? .This is Jerry Seinfeld.
Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.
The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.
From my house. I got a whole box of them.
Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here (points to kitchen), here (points to living room), or here (makes similar circle with his hands).
(shakes his head) I'm very sorry. (closing the door on Phil. Jerry smiles and shrugs apologetically as Phil stares at them through the glass)
No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.
Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do?
Kramer! (We hear Kramer's door slam open and shut. Kramer enters. Jerry comes out of his room.) Hey! Where's all my sneakers?
That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night...
You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola!
Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, (looking at the TV) Kramer, turn that up.
(looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!
Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!
No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.
Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.
Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full.
All right, but you have to go now.
$40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?
That's it! No more questions! I don't care!
So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER
Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.
You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?
(reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.
I have no patience for lactose. And I wont stand for it. Um, Ill be right back.
(to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here.
(Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What?
Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.
Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?
Hey, I've been back four days, I want my mail.
Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress.
All right, so uh, let's do something later. How 'bout a movie?
Ugh, the four worst words in the English language.
This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.
So he just gets soup. He wants to save the meal. So now I got to do it all over again.
We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.
I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.
Yeah, thats good. Hed clunk our heads together like Moe.
Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend.
I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing.
Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. and we got to talking, he sells Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.
Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?
(to waitress) I' ll just have a cup of coffee.
Oh who made you a Mohel? Whadya, get your degree from a matchbook?
(Like a little kid) But, I don't want to be a pirate!
Hey ya know I read an unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the other day, did you know the original title for "War and Peace" was "War--What Is It Good For?"!
(checking his watch) I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
I *just* learned that. (proudly holding the Yo-Yo)
Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?
(Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.
She's the model I met on the plane.
There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?
That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this, okay...
Aww, right. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it!
Yeah, yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. Would you mind. I'd like to take the picture back.
So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.
Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.
So you're not gonna come back to New York with us?
Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.
Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll watch 'em go slice this fat bastard up. (sips coffee)
We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing.
No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him.
Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors.
Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?
What if hes in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (Jerry knocks on imaginary glass.) How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? (He makes a hissing sound.) By the way, whats happening with Sendrax?
I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no.
Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. (To Kramer) I never should have cashed those checks!
I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something.
Oh, well here. Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it again.
(pointedly) Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars.
Yeah! I got it . It's in the apartment, but we can't go in there it's being fumigated.
Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.
So George and I went up to NBC and we told them the idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract.
(thinking) So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?
Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal right now. (covers Jean-Paul with a blanket)
Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.
Let's get outta here. [to Buckles] I'll see ya.
Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.
No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'
No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter (pauses) Oh no!
Yknow I think that even if youve had a relationship with someone, or lets say, especially if youve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, its very difficult. Isnt this? Its hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. Its like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, Look, a rabbit. The other goes, So? I believe this is your card. Look, why dont we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?
Could you move your car back a little?
Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not, a chicken.
I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.
Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.
There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.
You like the couch? Ill tell you what Im gonna do.
Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.
Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee.
Listen, Joel. Theres something I have to tell you...
Nope, the cop says its my word against his. Theres nothing they can do.
Hello. Didn't I see you at the pro shop yesterday?
No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.
Yeah, okay. (to Elaine) They may have found the car.
You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.
Yeah, well, I didnt- Is that something you want to borrow?
Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish...
You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.
No, I actually find you quite charming. A bit verbose at times...
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?
I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say.
Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on.
I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.
Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'
Actually, I did. I put it on last night and slept in it.
Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?
What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.
Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing...
(sarcastically) Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.
Non-fat yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it.
We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident.
No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage?
You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us.
There he is. He's going into that bar.
O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!
All right, that's enough of that. (Jerry takes the plates and hands them to a waitress.)
I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--
(into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!
Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.
So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.
People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
Here you go. (Poppie stands up and takes the money.) Anyway, I'm sorry again about the...(notices a large, wet stain on his couch)...the...the...
(opens the door for George) Where did you get that?
What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?
Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.
Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.)
Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.
Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.
Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here.
I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.
Ive got the softball game on Wednesday. Its the championship.
No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. Maybe we should ask him.
You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?
Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.
Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.
I dunno, watch it on TV I guess. Why?
Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in your friend John Germaine's band there.
(accusingly) Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.
But then I found out about the skin cancer.
Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way.
Ya. (hits the button, opens the door. To Elaine) Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys.
Well, theyre three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.
Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.
(disbelief) So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?!
Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.
It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.
(on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV for another minute) The letter, that's the letter!
(on the phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second. (George walks in  Jerry asks George) So we definitely dont want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes his head NO) Alright, were back together again, great. Bye bye.
(interrupts) I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.
Of course I was getting you a note.
Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?
You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this jockey and the jockey got off the horse and started chasin' him.
Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.
I thought you were going out with Celia?
(livid) Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one!
Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.
George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?
Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are?
There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.
Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine?
Donna, really, youre making too much of this.
You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.
That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?
(animated) They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!
(Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.
Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?
Let me tell you something Babu. You go back in that kitchen -- tell your chef I want the works.
This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy.
I guess you can take anything, but actual work.
For crying out loud, He's Superman. (Fulton stops laughing, Jerry's face is stunned) Fulton? (looks at him) Fulton?
No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.
You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?
Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!
She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?
Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.
Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer. It shows at least he's making an effort.
And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.
So how come you're not going over there for dinner?
So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.
There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.
Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.
(giving him a steak from the fridge) Here ya go.
Good evening, folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--
Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?
Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.
What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty minutes of 'So, who's from out of town?'
I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.
Were taking Elaine to dinner. Shes got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?
Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him.
So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian...
(fidgets like he has no room with George next to him)... Could you move over there?!
Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?
The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal.
Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.
August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress! She never changes! Oh my god. (looking around) She's gotta have hundreds of these dresses.
Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?
You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding.
I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
Especially that big kid up in the front. (Mr. Pitt is shown on the television, trying to hold up the deflating Woody balloon.) How old is he? (The phone rings.) Hello?
So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here.
Im not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll em down below my knee?
Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. Youve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?
He feels funny. You don't have to do this.
No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.
No, but he's not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR)
You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught.
She likes him I mean she really likes him.
Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.
(to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?
What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I would've done, if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!!
That puddle! (Kramer sees the puddle and does a double-take.)
Why don't you just get rid of it?
Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'
Suspected serial killer, he didn't actually do it.
You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.
To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go "Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch." According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.
(While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands him a nickel)
(He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.
All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.
No body said youre fat. Hes a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy.
Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.
Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.
Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.
(Stopping him) No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!
(picking up his bag and coat) Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?
Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend. (puts his arm around Elaine's shoulder, but she shrugs it off twice)
(holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.
Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.
Would you turn that down! What is that crap!
I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous!
No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?
I don't know Kramer, ahh, my concern is that ....
All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.
No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver.
But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure.
(Interrupting Bania) Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.
I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...
How could you eat fish on a plane?
It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?
I love the day date. No wine, No shower.
What is that? (Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.)
oh you think she's Erika, the phone sex woman
Well I guess if I?m the Miana I should go. All right, all right.
(also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it.
Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this, now she's got nothing.
Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.
There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?
(Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.
So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.
Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.
Hey is the same thing as hello. What do you think Jeannie.
I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.
And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.
(in the hallway, hearing the door lock behind him, turns back) Kramer!
Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.
I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.
No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time?
No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.
Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.
Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?
You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal.
I'm in the book and I have a machine.
Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing.
The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper!
All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.
I'm not letting you cheat, Newman. You're not getting anywhere near that board.
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.
You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.
Im supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?
That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow. It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.
What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up.
Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference who's tall. We're all tall.
Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?
It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library
But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.
Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.
A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see 'em. Come on, I'm calling! (thumps hand on table) What d'you got!
We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.
First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.
He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?
Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.
No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.
Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give it back to me.
(through gritted teeth) Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.
Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.
The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?
Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.
How you gonna get out of *that* one?
You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand?
Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.
You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.
I don't have it. You want half my omelet? (holds his omelet plate up to Bania)
Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.
She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.
No, really, I just got off the phone with him.
(dry) I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw? (really disappointed) Let's get out of here George.
It's like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action.
He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.
He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?
Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?
I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.
No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.
So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.
What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!
A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the dish and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit.
What're you doing? I thought you were changing.
(acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?
I don't know, but you better keep it up.
He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it.
Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
Alright, come on, lets get out of here.
Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.
Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?
Alright.. (Heads for the door, grabbing his coat)
Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway.
Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late.
George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.
Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...
Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.
I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.
The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..
I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight....
You know you're not supposed to drink while you're keeping a secret! (Elaine laughs) Is there anything else?
(tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back) Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.
No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.
So you want to just abolish all home package deliveries.
Latex? And what do I do with latex?
Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?
hello. Oh, hi. What's happening?  what? oh um, sure,  um, yeah, okay, uh. I'll see you then. Yeah, yeah, Bye.
Oh my god, you're kidding. (dives for his wallet) Hang on a second. (reading from his registration) It's JVN 728.
I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.
I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.
Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.
I know it's a big problem.. she puts like four pieces in her mouth, it's ridiculous, I don't think we're gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.
Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.
Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?
Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.
If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. Hes always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess its because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.
You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?
Hello,  oh hi Elaine .. what's going on  no he just left  you broke up with him?  ME TOO .. what happened?  oh smoking you know you're like going out with C. Everet Coope  me  nah  I couldn't go through with it  I just didn't feel ready  so what are you doing now?  Oh, great idea, I'll meet you there in like thirty minutes. Okay bye.
It has nothing to do with whose house it is.
I never heard anybody curse in a toast.
Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father.
(interrupting) Can I talk to you for a second?
That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his fathers band. Hed loan it to you.
By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.
Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.
Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?
... I just got a postcard from Elaine?
Meat? I dont, I dont know, go... hunt! (Kessler opens the refrigerator and sticks his head in.) Well what happened in the game anyway?
Widower? Wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research)
(worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!
Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.
Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?
Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner?
Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.
(pointing out the obvious) George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him.
I don't know. (takes off his sweater) This sweater really itches me. You want it?
(on the phone) Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.
So he just shaves his head for no reason?
Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.
Id really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.
Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.
Yeah, let me just stop by the cash machine and I'll meet you over at the coffee shop.
Well don't get too comfortable. As soon as Seth gets a real job you two are gong back in that chicken supernova.
Doesnt matter. Whats the young mans name? I would like to meet him.
It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.
Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.
Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.
So tonight are you going to make the move?
Yeah but theres a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet.
Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.
Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.
I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.
Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?
Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!
(To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.
Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door)
Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?
Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!
Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
Shes right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, Im gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.
Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah.
I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.
YEAH? (speaking loudly so the visitor can hear him through the intercom)
(TO GEORGE, REWOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?
Look Ramon, about the other day. Im sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway.
And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.
It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.
Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.
Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?
George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality.
(Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?
No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car.
Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.
You had a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with my butler?
That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen -
In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.
That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The Mohel circumcised my finger!
Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard.
The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.
Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why dont you just settle it like mature adults?
No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1,900 dollars.
I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.
I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high.
(thinking) Yeah, thats normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?
Well, thats it. Look, Im going to Vermont. I dont want to think about this. Im selling.
You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.
(to the Drake) Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye...
Well, uh, I uh, I dont want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe its not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.
And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
All right. Come on sit down. It's about to start.
(to the phone) Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my moneys gone... Well, call me right back. (Jerry hangs up.) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasnt been home or in his office in the past three days!
No, Uncomfortable? Not at all. (ASIDE TO ELAINE) My friend's wife's breast sticking out - why would that make me uncomfortable?
That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no--
No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.
Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up.
Well, You can't go in there it's like a gas chamber in there.
What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time
You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.
Well , as I said this type of thing is very common in show business
So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.
He was running from a bee. (Elaine laughs)
Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?
Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.
(pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?
Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.
(to George) Is that uh, other apartment still available?
Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years.
Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!
Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner
Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone? You wanted the machine. You know, and you're always kind of thrown off, (left hand up to side of face, pretending its a receiver) you go "Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you."
Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?
Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you?
They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
(as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people.
(Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.
Well, you want your organizer back don't you?
Ma, I told you, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan... Okay, bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Rava) My mother. She forgot how to make French toast. You know how mothers are.
(Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here?
Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.
Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me.
I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.
Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.
All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, "It's been real," move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.
No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it. (thinks out loud, opens phone book) Becker, ... Becker, ...
What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with. [To attendant] What is going on?
Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.
See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.
You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it?
Well ... ok, I guess (voice trailing off)
Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. (George gives Elaine a look while Jerrys back is turned. Jerry turns around.) I saw that.
Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.
Who was in town on a business venture, and um..
I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away)
Let me call him back... Hello? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.
Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?
I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this.
Well, either you see him or you don't.
Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. ! Celebrate! How about some champagne?
Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?
All right lets go. We'll meet you back down here in ten minutes, hopefully with the money.
Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?
You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.
I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.
(To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?
No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out.
Because she's my wife! (The door buzzer sounds; Jerry answers it) Yeh?
(Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled "Ori-dent") Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!
Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed like ten new minutes.
You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. (Phone rings, he answers it) Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend.
It was the single worst moment of my life.
Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.
You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me. He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back.. I'm putting this guy ....RIGHT OUT OF COMMISSION....
Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.
Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.
Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?
He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.
I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there.
Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.
No!!! The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him, you break his spirit!
All right, I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else.
Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.
I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.
(to Morty) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street!
(On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.
You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...
Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.
Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?
As a guy I dont know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I dont know how to say, Bill, I feel I need to see other men. Do you know what I mean? Theres nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think thats the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because theyre two guys. Thats almost all we need to have in common. Cause sports  sports and women  is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, So, whats in the refrigerator?
Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. (Elaine smiles and rolls her eyes at him) What brings you here?
(naked, carrying a belt sander) I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.
(pointing toward the guy) See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.
Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Just give me a little squeeze.
She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing to George) He likes the pop-in, too.
When's he leaving? (putting some items into the refrigerator)
Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.
You cant go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.
Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.
Oh, did you get that outta my bag?
Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.
Yeah, but why would you... (Kramer is eating a peach then disgusted he spits it out) Bad peach?
They did it for three years. What's another few months.
But I could do that and the music.
I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didnt want to talk to, I could go, Excuse me, Im not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away. I also have a cordless phone, but I dont like that as much, because you cant slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone  You cant talk to me like that! Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone  You cant talk to me like that!
I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!
Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.
Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.
I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' (mimes throwing) 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?
Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.
Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.
But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.
Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.
...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.
What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.
I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!
Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes.
Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight!
Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one.
Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright, I'm dropping you off at work, right?
Yeah.. When he's dead he'll be relieved... Oh by the way Viking Press sent a Fedex for you to my parents. They brought it with 'em.
(privately amused) Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while. (indicating Elaine) Her too.
(opening the door) Well, it was nice meeting you.
There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing *just* a bra. I can't get that image out of my mind.
Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.
I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.
There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?
Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.
So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did?
Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?
No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?
Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.
(Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?
Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it.
Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George "Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again."
Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.
I thought you were gonna watch a video.
What if he doesn't call now out of spite?
(To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.
Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?
Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?
Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.
50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.
Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.
Alright! (picks up the phone and dials) Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. You know, you got a great 'John Houseman' name. Alec Berg. Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg?
So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.
...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.
We're gonna have to talk about this later. (Elaine holds the door open for Jerry while holding her leg) Thank you. Taxi!
Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.
'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?
I don't know. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley..."
How are we gonna get out of it?
It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.
(picks up phone) Hello? (listens) Oh, hi Mr. Pitt.
And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.
Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.
Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.
I don't understand what the big deal is.
You really used to have a think full head of hair.
Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?
Ill call Kramer. He can check my house.
Oh! my god. What the hell is this? ..... Don't tell me.......Velvet!!!
Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.
Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.
Do you want me to break up with you?
Does it ever bother you that this organization-
So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?
Hey listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, why don't you have dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if you want, you know, have a little company, take the pressure off.
Um, who do I make it out to?
And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone.
I just got the most bizarre message from you father, Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!
She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults. Things you would know very little about.
Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?
Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time.
Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?
This is the man you have a crush on?
What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like it?
(What's goin' on,) like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--
A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision.
Oh. No. What, you mean because of the "Chang"?
Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women.
Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?
Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined.
Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, "Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms."
Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the check to Elaine) look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.
Although what if its one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?
(back in booth) He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life.
This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-
Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.
I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So(throws away belt) thats it!
It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.
(A couple of days ago I used a public phone), go over time on the call, hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, "Yeah, operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?"
Well what am I supposed to do now?
And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!
Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, "Hey, they like the soup! Keep it up!"?
Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?
Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.
(looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.
Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort?
(seeing Elaine enter Monk's) Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body?
They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy.
Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery.
Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.
(under his breath) Well, this worked out just as I had hoped.
(wistful) I don't know, I just see you guys together.
It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.
So, she got you to join a book club?
(cynical) This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday?
(Continuing reading) "The Human Fund. Money for people."
You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story??
That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?
Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...
(still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.
I think that's a "what's good for the goose is good for the gander".
I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.
Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?
Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper of the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack . . .
I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a "magical world" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.
Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.
I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!
Of course she doesnt have five thousand dollars!
Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the verge of this big promotion?
Its a good mirror. (They look at their menus.) So, what are you gettin?
Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.
I got a date with that girl, Lena.
Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.
No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?
Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen.
and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye.
Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea.
You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.
What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!
But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.
So what about the "Maestro" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.
Well, her belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) Im bored. Talk to me.
What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him? 'Cos I asked him about the Knicks?
Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?
There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of... (he cracks) Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?!
You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store.
I still don't know what the idea is.
Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.
I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!
Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!
Elaine, you cannot judge a person on a situation like that. I mean it's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert
I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.
Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?
I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..
I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.
What do you need a job, you got Audrey.
He looks like you and he's working from the inside?
(thoughtful) Hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey, there it is.
Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off that sign?
The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.
(explaining) I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.
(Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.
George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?
(to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?
Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.
I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?
Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.
Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.
But you were supposed to get me a refund.
You must have quite a time down there.
Well, just give it back, and I wont say anything.
Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? Theres Elastic Man... Plastic Man...
George, this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on. (Jerry leaves.)
Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for? I don't know about that, I'll have to think about it. I'll let you know. Okay, bye.
Well you said they could come and take the records.
Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy.
"I don't know but I was spitting out and rinsing like there was no tomorrow."
Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.
Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you.
You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.)
Oh, great. Ok we'll goin' away. I think I'm excited.
You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!
Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*!
(stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored)
It's like Im talking to my Aunt Sylvia here.
Well I think I get the gist of it.
No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?
Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.
Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop, clip clop. They're nuts for it.
Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.
(grimaces and takes the shovel back) I'll dig.
I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?
I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck.
Where did you see that? Those are private!!!
Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.
And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises.
Yes. Yes I am! (to Helen) What else did she say on the phone?
You got it ALL wrong. I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoans
Just, uh, plop it on the counter there.
I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory.
Yeah. (thinking) That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. (decisive) I'm gonna do it.
Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.
I have to go over to my grandmother's.
The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like youre always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. Youre out somewhere with people, Gee, you look pregnant.. are you? Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, thats not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Lets take this whole scene again. People, think about what youre saying!
I know nothing, but what did you actually do?
Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!
We found out his super power was lack of money.
(sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.
Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.
Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.
Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I?m serious, I?m not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.
Im Jerry, Elaines friend, and this is George.
Well, it was the best of those movies.
It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it.
Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally!
I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.
(to the phone) Oh, its you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldnt have had to do this. Now thats two long distance calls I made to you why cant you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again; to nobody) Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much.
(with a wild expression) Hey, Kramer! I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open!
Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because moneys a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you dont care about money when youre hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, youre like the ruler of an empire. More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives. Then after the meal, you know, youve got the pants open, youve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. Theyre mystified by the check. What is this? How could this be? They start passing it around the table, Does this look right to you? Were not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?
I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?
(tearing through his laundry bag) Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on, let's go.
Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.
All right. (picks up the alarm clock) Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 650... volume check. (music playing, he starts swinging) What kinda music you wanna wake up to? Top 40, classical...
Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men
'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'.
Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg.
What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. (acts like he did in the movie) Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. (does the next look) I mean, beyond that, Im risking a punch in the mouth. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?
Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.
I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!
cool guy? what are you, in 8th grade?
Yes you do. That's what you both think.
Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt.
That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. Its like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you doing today?
Just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces Kramer) Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!
Boy, It's the way they just slip it in there too.
(Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key?
Oh No, wait a second... Wait a second... I-I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name.
That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.
And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus
(Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah?
How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?
(buzzes her up) Eh. (to Kramer) You know and I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying "my wife." Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - "my wife" this, "my wife" that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence.
I've hardly been out to dinner with them.
No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.
Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?
What are you talkin about? Its fine, I love having you here.
Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.
There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.
All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a specimen.
Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.
Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, Im in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants.
I thought it was open to the public.
I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from.
It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.
Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?
I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.
AH. Yes that's gonna make a big difference.
(Once again, the audience hears his thoughts) I'm so car sick. I'm gonna vomit!
Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?
The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.
Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers?
No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?
Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me.
Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!
Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on.
Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin?
Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!
Well, what's going on? What is this thing?
You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married.
Well at least you and I are okay again.
Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.
I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.
No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.
12 gauge. Seems to be the most popular gauge.
It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.
(agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!
tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.
Hey, not bad. (pointing to crest) I kinda like this little thing here.
Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.
All right Ramon, Im going to get going.
I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.
(standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. (indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.
Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency.
SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya! (the inter- com buzzes) Yeah?
(still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.
Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together.
Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price?
Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.
You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.
There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.
(referring to George's outfit) And what mood is this.
Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.
Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)
Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.
Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
I never shouldve gotten involved in this. Im a nervous wreck. Im not cut out for investing.
(to George) No. (to Kramer) I told you not to say anything.
Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.
And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.
I think I heard her say something about a bench.
Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.
Yes, so people are just dialing it by mistake and getting you.
All right, so I had wooden teeth, so what?
Really? Did you hear that? Somebody else was killed!
When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers.
Yeah, its some place down in the village.
I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table.
Well we're sitting here together. Why wouldn't you think that.
So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was just wondering if there were houses there to rent.
You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy.
Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket?
That was our babka. We had that babka!
Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you.
Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine.
Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for?
But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.
Theres the giant ball of oil. Clares right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!
Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something.
(to the phone) Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you- Oh, Hi. Joel... Oh, you just came in... Listen, I cant make it to the game tonight... I, uh, have to tutor my nephew... Yeah, hes got an exam tomorrow... Geometry... You know, trapezoids, rhombus... Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. Theyre at the Will-Call window... And Im really sorry... Have a good time... Well talk next week... Okay... Yeah, I dont... Fine.. Fine... Bye.
Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.
That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.
Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?
Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.
And who were you tryin to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?
All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.
She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.
No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe it. I lost him. That stupid idiot. Now what are we going to do?
You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!
(Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them!
That's a hell of an organization they're running up there. I can't understand why they haven't won a pennant in 15 years.
Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. (The door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
Hey, have fun at the... family reunion. (George exits) So, what do you know about this Jack fellow?
(Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.
Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!
What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers.
Oh! I got a message. (presses button on answer machine)
Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign.
You want to spend the rest of your life with her
Am I going? It was three nights ago.
(aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?
Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.
Well, well, look at you. It?s a little skimpy there isn't it?
Great, its yours. I can't stand the sight of it. Elaine, heres the car keys. (tosses her the keys)
I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.
"Guys And Dolls"? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?
Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.
So you were with him that day at the track?
Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.
I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.
I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem.
Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?
Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist enters Monk's)
Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?
I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.
(picks it up) I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table.
Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to 'em. Mind if I walk through real quick?
What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you.
(playing Scrabble with his naked girlfriend) Zephyr? That is not a word.
(hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman.
She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.
You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?
(examining the button) Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like a tooth.
I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.
I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!
Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.
Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You cant do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.
Many times. You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet.
Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.
I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me "C'mon Jerry, go along, go along..."
No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
(Trying to block out Kramer, he starts to sing along with the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus..
Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.
Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?
Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. It'll crush him.
Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually do it)
I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.
Now, all we gotta do is write it.
Oh, shes really great. I mean, shes got like a real warmth about her and shes really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better.
Hey, I thought you went to the game.
Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight. In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.
Um, actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet. (takes the paper back)
Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?
A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?
Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?
Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.
Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure there are many people who do not like me.
I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.
Well, we need change and all I have is twenties.
Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little.
No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.
Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign.
Hey I don't even want the pen now!
Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.
No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.
(grabbing the list from Kramer) You're not getting any plantains.
So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?
So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?
Whats the difference?! Thats the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!
Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.
(Looking down at the shirt; mumbling) Oh, thank you.
So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything.
Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.
Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.
Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.
Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.
Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.
Well... theres a little bit of a problem.
Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.
All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff.
Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.
Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?
The % thing to do is just not think about it.
Hi. Hi. Look, I don't know what you think --
(reluctant) Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy.
It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go. (to old man that enters) It was GEORGE!
Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Jerry hugs Kramer, then grabs him by the cheeks.) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think Im in the clear here. Elaines not moving in. I dont have to confront her. She has no idea I never wanted her to move in. Im golden!
All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've flown first class, Elaine-- I can't go back to coach. I can't... I won't...
Hey, I had nothing to do with it.
Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered? (Sees the pac) What happened?
Why dont they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, Just Back. All back; No front. You walk in the front, youre immediately in the back. (Jerry picks up a tie display, and shakes it rhythmically from left to right.) Look, Elaine, tie carwash.
Oh, I cant. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly.
What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?
I'm callin' Elaine. See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley.
(thinking) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft... (to Vanessa) Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit.
Of course I can, am I being funny now?
Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?
What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?
Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere.
No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything off me, first laughs now ladies.
Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' "Where's your jock strap?" Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.
You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.
I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.
Expecting Newman? That's funny because I just happened upon him down at the Kenny Roger's Roasters.
Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!
Oh, were meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building.
(quietly, yet in a high and whiney tone) Well, I don't know if I....
I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.
Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.
Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.
Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.
All right, she said she couldnt find a decent hotel room...
No I wasn't there. (enters and slams the door)
(looks in the creamer) Theres no milk in here, what...
What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?
I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.
(opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?
Oh and I've got some things of yours here.
I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.
Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. (holds his nose up like a pig) You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.
Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.
(singing) Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home.
Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.
I mean, if were gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.
Of course, I stink, you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks..
So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!
Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if its done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels!
Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up.
That's funny, that's funny! "I'm sick of cleaning." That's very funny.
The way I feel when I go places with you? (Kramer enters.) Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?
You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS!
He went crazy from one note. He couldnt get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.
Sample? (under his breath) Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book.
You don't even know what a write off is.
(Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.
(Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal.
Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?
(reluctant) Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too.
Leo's furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at George's book) What is that doing on the table?
Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--
. Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it
So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.
Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia, watching Jerry on TV. Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.
Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar.
Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
(answering the phone) Hello? Yeah, the van is still for sale. Sure, come on buy.
All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now.
Babu? Babu...[waves Babu to come to table] Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just, it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?
(surveying the restaurant) Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it!
I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes.
Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.
Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?
Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.
(to the Drake) Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. (To Elaine) Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?
You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
Oh, like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping carts with one bad wheel?
All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?
Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.
I said yes, but I don't feel right about it. I mean I hardly know the guy. That's a big step oin a relationship. The biggest. That's like going all the way.
Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..
Uh huh. Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?
Shes limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.
(to Elaine) Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?
Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city.
He left me there. You see the mind games?
I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.
You know, I think he wears a piece.
(Nodding) I think you may have something there.
(to George) I mean, come on. (a thought occurs) No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from *Seals and Croft*.
What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police dont use them for, you know, crowd control. (Jerry crouches down, and makes like hes riding a pony.) Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, Im talking to you. Behind the barricades! So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldnt it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... Baltic, thats two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, thats it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.
The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.
You wanna go with me up to (clap) the Bronx and see if there's any flyers on George's car.
(throws out his hands) What does he listen to? The all Desperado station?
So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out Im giving you a raise.
Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thingreal bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though.
(noticing a coffee table book) Oh, you got the Civil War book. I saw some of that show, it was wonderful.
Yeah, but how could you be so sure?
Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman...
I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or somebody? What's with this guy? (Gino looks at him annoyed) Just asking.
So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?
I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, "This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here."
... I think. Have some more wine. (Jerry pours his whole glass of wine into her glass.)
I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club...
Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.
Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!
Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, "Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. " "What are you watching?" "I don't care, I gotta keep going." "Who was that?" "I don't know what it was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going." Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, "Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel." You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, "Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of here. I'm going to bed."
So how did you leave it with him?
Right in the head! (leans in and points at Testikov)
Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that.
(unheard by Jenna) When the battery runs out.
I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.
Relax, hes late. Hes always late. Its part of his M.O.
Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless.
Then what do you call it? People dont just bump into each other and have sex. This isnt cinemax.
Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.
Oh really? (tries turning away in the hopes Elaine gets the hint; thinking) Oh God, I gotta get out of this.
Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)
Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes.
Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. (standing) I'm going to the bathroom.
You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.
Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.
What are you so worried about this for?
I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?
I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.
Whats to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.
A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.
Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?
And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?
What? (to George) What did, what did you say?
You, sidle? Y-You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!
Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?
Alright, but let me ask you this question.
You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.
(To Elaine) Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get some coffee.
Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs phone up)
I like that thing in your hair there.
"What are you doing that for, you got a job"
You picked up on a vibe, from a nun.
What do you say to a person like you?
Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.
(trying to defuse the situation) Look, no-one is lifting anything.
Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.
Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?
Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of deadbeats.
That is so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood horse?
(accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?
I mean it's no big deal. You're still drivin'. You should have been watching the road.
(To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom buzzes) That's Elaine. (Kramer buzzes her in. Jerry talks into the phone) Kramer.. (To Kramer) George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.
They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor.
So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.
They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.
You promise you'll never come in here again?
So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?
hey you know it's weird because that voice sounded a little familiar to me
Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.
(indicating the woman) Game, set and match, huh Milos?
Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy.
Do you have to write all this stuff down.
Oh, The Muted Heart. Glen Close. Sally Field. Well, that should be good.
I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!
It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.
What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead.
Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh...
You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.
I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.
Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
(to himself) Once a week? (to Uncle Leo) So how's Lydia?
(Takes the bottle from him) Just swallow 'em.
This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!
Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to go?
I don't have to be funny, I don't care.
That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it. (throws watch in garbage)
Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.
(also wearing a moustache) What do you mean, 'what is it?' It's a country right next to Belgium.
(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the "It's me" on the phone today.
What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying...
Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?
Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?
Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.
You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.
Well, I just want you to know I'm there for you. Course now I'm here for you, but when i'm not here for you, i'm there for you.
Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test.
Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guys out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, its true, men hear a drill, its like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, Honey, I think Jims working on something over there. So they run over to the guy. Now they dont actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. Thats what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, What are you using, a Phillips-head? You know, we feel involved. Thats why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, thats just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they dont cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, thatll hold.
I'm saying "get the hell outta there"! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call, Jean-Paul! A wake-up call!
So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil
Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!
Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.
So Marcelino's going to take down the check?
No, don't stop, Kramer. Keep going, don't let him get away.
So Whatley sayd to me, "Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic."
Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house  and then I saw it in your house.
First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did.
How do you get all that wood in here?
I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.
Oh I'm stressed! (makes like Kramer, outstretching his arm. Jerry heads for the freezer for some ice cream.)
[forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell out of here!
Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.
Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here.
No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.
Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.
Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck.
Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.
Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?
All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.
I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.
(to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...
So what happened? You gave her my tax papers? ... My papers?
But you made it through the day before.
I know enough not to get on them.
Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?
No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car.
You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.
(Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?
If only the coin hadnt hit the table.
Hey, look, there's Bobby Eighteen?s father-in-law, Mr Reichman. George and I were just talking about that today, I can?t believe it! That?s the guy who threw George out of the wedding.
Anyway Beth, you know i was thinking on my way over how when i was 9. I wanted these handball sneakers, they were all black but they came in adult sizes so you know i never got the sneakers. (Beth looks him confused)
(on the phone) Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Ya. Oh, really? Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye. (hangs up the phone) Well, the yogurt verdict is in. (Kramer looks at Jerry with his arms out) Fat!
Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours.
Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.
No, I just wanted to see what time it was.
I didnt know what the coma etiquette was.
Wow! Zanadu . No wonder youre putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) May I?
But thats what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. Theyre knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus.
Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo.
Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.
I'll go if someone else drives. You going?
Best friend- Ive never been to your apartment.
Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.
The bad fianc&Mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...
Good idea. (phone's ringing, goes to it) (muttering) There's a beach towel on the rack.. (to phone) Yeah.
Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So...
(continuing) The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.
(Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.
Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.
So you go in the bathroom at eleven your in bed by what, two?
(places two slices of bread against Kramer's face) That is close.
Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.
There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.
I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?
Oh no, where's the blood? (opens the fridge) It's in here isn't it?
All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...
I never should have made up those rules.
No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman.
Oh, no. Its not that I dont think you can. I know that you cant, and Im positive that you wont.
Never. (The elevator door opens.) Wait a second. Thats her. On the right.
(into phone) Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. (to George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!
No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
And who is on the show? Who are the characters?
I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!
Why don't you see what you can do?
Ohh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands. So.. (Goes for his coat)
I'm gonna go let Elaine in. (Kramer reaches out to stop him leaving)
Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here.
All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?
Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.
I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.
She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.
Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved.
(still in tuxedo, tie undone) Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.
(long pause).......Sure. ( humms a song then stares at the toothbrush)
I didnt tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog?
Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby.
She thinks youre a guy that doesnt like coffee.
And you didnt even hear how she sounded.
How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go.
You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!
Well its not like it's a really funny story or anything.
Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.
Let me get a clean pair. (Goes into his room. George strides over to the window.)
Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.
You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.
Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a One-woman show?
Hey, guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!
You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!
Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame.
Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.
(re-entering) Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again, are you?
And youre sure the floss was the catalyst?
Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to Elaine)
You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didnt take it. (pointing to himself) This is an idiot.
I mean that's fine if that's who you are...
Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail.
(To George) You're givin' him back that TV.
Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.
(Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining room doorway) I think the busboy's in trouble.
..And then she starts talking about her panties.
(Arms out, complaining) I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!
Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land.
you know I'd like to hear about this job of yours
Oooh! I got a pain in my side.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good things.
(putting on his coat to go downstairs, he finds the key in his coat pocket) I believe this belongs to you.
Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your..
What happened to you? You were going like a hundred miles an hour.
(Jokingly playing off Kramer's statement) With a different body.
(looking at the cop) What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think he's getting coffee.!
Whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guyll be like, I dont think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life? And of course the womans looking at the guy, thinking, What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?
Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.
The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.
You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world "I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable." (George is baffled)
Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.
He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man that's some tart cider!
You think they have fleas there, don't you?
(Singing) Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!
(to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)
"I don't know how you can eat that spicy chicken,"
Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.
Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!
We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.
Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Yknow Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, shes probably screamin at those aliens, I gotta have a lo mein!
Course you know there is always the possibility, that she called an audible.
Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?
No, I think I would have remembered Memma.
We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked.
(Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!
Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.
I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a riot.
How long has your car been sitting in the Yankee parking lot?
Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, thats a good idea.
No. This is why you're not in the pilot.
alright I changed my mind, uh yeah I don't think I'm not gonna go now
All right, lets go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.
Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!
How about when Harrison Ford jumped out of that plane, and he was shooting back at them as he was falling?
Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?
This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.
What are you doing? You're choking me. Elaine!
Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?
Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.
You guys both have class at the same time?
Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document.
All right, let me ask you this when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?
I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.
I saw one once that could do sign language.
That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up. (phone rings) Excuse me one second.
The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?
Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.
Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--
(more disgusted) Ohhhh! You cant! Its impossible! Theres no break in the conversation where you can go, All right then... You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.
Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.
(Surprised to see her, he gets up) Where's George?
Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.
Hey. It's you! (pointing) Th..that's my Friars Club jacket!
Well, senator, Id just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it.
Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch?
Oh, yes. Particularly if youre not in it.
Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do.
All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the bottle of fungicide.)
Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.
No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.
You know I went out once with a nude model. Never let me see her naked. Hundreds of people see her naked every week, except me. Needless to say it was quite vexing.
(While digging in his pocket for some money, he looks over the shirts one last time) You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt..
I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it.
Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't do you favors after you dump them.
Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.
So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new guy, in a big pot of love stew.
Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 650 AM tomorrow morning.
No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!
It was just an innocent comment! I didnt know she had a pony!
(Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.
No, go ahead. Look at this place. I cant wait to get it cleaned.
(quietly) I told you to cut it out.
Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.
...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry.
Well this is a great place to sit you got here.
Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.
Yes it will, now give me those keys!
Im not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want.
No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.
So youre saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, its all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.
That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.
(Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?
Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus.
We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.
This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.
You're not a little anything, Newman. So just pack it up and move it out of here.
Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.
I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.
Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship.
My stomach, I , think it was that cookie.
I think what he's trying to say is, "get the bouilla-base." (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)
Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?
'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.'
Newman . Open the door, Newman, I know you're in there.
See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.
Ah, you know. Im supposed to meet, eh, someone -- Ill, Ill wait for them outside. (walks towards the door)
I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?
She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...
You got a lot to learn about pancakes.
I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.
Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...
Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?
What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?
Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.
So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.
It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman.
No, no Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.
Seth! Wow what has it been like five years?
Well there's always a place for you, on our team.
(looking outside) Hey Newman, is that your red car?
Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?
Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.
I'm not paying for anything until I get that back.
Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya doing?
(Kramer shows Jerry and Elaine the paper) "Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research".." Government funds genetic research at area hospital" ... Yeah, so?
Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. >click click click<...
So you just did the opposite of everything?
(To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?
Well, we gotta get it washed (pulls off a few flyers)....Ah, the keys are locked inside!
He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.
Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything. Why don't we all just go to Paris?
Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?
Youre wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!
(TO KRAMER, REBOX) Will you let me help you with that?
Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.
When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.
Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!
He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.
So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) "Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again." They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system..."Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to the plane in my apartment." You see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet "hide-a-key" under the wing..."maybe he left it up there somewhere..."
If you need more time, you should have more time.
Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!
"Naaaaaa...I can't watch a man sing a song."
You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?
(like a frustrated child) Why can't I know?
Kramer!? (grabbing Kramer's arm roughly, pulling him back as he's about to knock)
Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay... is uh...
Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?
You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.
Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test?
I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.
(quickly moves over toward Matthew) What the *beep*(fuck) are you doing? You little piece of *beep*(shit)!
Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?
All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. She's at CALVIN KLEIN's right now.
He yells and you don't get your soup.
All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you double what you paid for it.
I'll tell you, that There for you crap was a stroke of genius.
I always feel bad for the silver medal winner in the Olympics. How do you live with that the rest of your life? People are gonna keep asking, "- How much did you lose by? - I don't even know...! It was like...(very fast) now.now...now.now..now..was like, like... now..now..now...! It was it...! Eh, it was it and I lost. I trained, I worked out, I exercised, I did everything, I was doing push-ups, sit-ups, I never did anything but exercise and work out for 20 years, I flew half way around the world and aaaaaaaaaah!...(showing a tiny distance between his index and thumb) And that was...it was a photo-finish! Silver...(stretching his neck forward)...gold. If I had a pimple, I would've won.
Oh, alright ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....
Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you?
Not our "all the way", their "all the way." I got the stink of responsibility on me.
Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.
Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.
Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?
We make all these plans - this idiot goes a hundred miles an hour - the whole weekend's over - incredible - just like that -
So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk.
I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, "Oh This is so good. What's in it?" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not.
I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.
Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business thing...
Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.
I really have to go to the bathroom.
Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!
But you did actually throw his coat out the window.
Yeah, and youre just what shes looking for too  a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.
Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral?
This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.
Hey Doc, check this out. [does an around-the-world with the Yo-Yo]
I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)
Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'
(nonplused) You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?
Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I would've asked her.
And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?
So you want to go to the party on Friday night?
Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them.
Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.
That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!
Where have you been? You know, you're on next.
The captain of the toes. (phone rings) Hello.
Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?
Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.
Hey. So how was"Blame it on the Rain?"
Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!
Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.
Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here.
No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?
Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!
Look, you can hang out here if you want.
(turning to each other) I dont know. Hes an importer.
(fetching a drink from the fridge) Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.
So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister...
No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off.
Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy.
And where does it end? Then everyones doin it. Its like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, "Dont go there." - Someones gotta take a stand!
Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. (casually leaves)
Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!
Y'know, I think I'll pass on the "Guys And Dolls"...
No, I dont think so. Ive seen you two together. You make each other miserable. Its kismet.
Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police! Some guy just gave me a wise answer. Ask that woman.
What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.
How would you know? You don't speak Korean.
Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?
She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing.
(getting worked up) I don't need the money.
What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?
Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know, we can't go anywhere near there.
No, no, no, it's... "She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her."
No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble..
Yknow, my parents are coming in for this...
If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.
Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?
George? (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.
Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me...
If I told you, you woulda given it away.
Ah, so, ah, flower shows and, shopping for pretty bows, and then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight?
(answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.
You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.
Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?!
Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?
I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in.
Yeah, hes nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper up to Jerry.) I know, I know. Its down again.
(derisively at Kramer) Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?
Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.
Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?
Yeah, so do you. (George enters with a newspaper.)
Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.
I didnt know. Kramer told me about the worlds.
No social reason for them to be here.
I think that would be a very nice gesture.
So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?
You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.
So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?
So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.
You gotta go to my chiropractor, hes the best.
Oh, see that's not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people.
You do of course try on, when you buy?
I want this baby fully loaded. (listens) Well, how soon can you get it there? (listens) Oh, that's terrific. (listens) Okay, thanks, bye.
Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.
All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?
It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?
I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.
Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?
Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?
Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.
I like your nails, that is a great color.
All right, forget it, forget it. Im not taking the place!
Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die.
Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?
No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.
(from the back of the club, leaving) That's it I'm calling in the big guns.
wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to just sense it's in front of the couch?
Have you said anything to her about it?
I dont even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, Ive met them three times in my life.
Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot.
Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.
So the roommate laughed at everything I said.
Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.
And I don't want you to hold mine!
Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
(quietly) Hey, uh, Milos, I don't mind rolling over here, but could you lighten up on the 'not a man' stuff?
Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income.
Oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh that's terrific... Mulva.
No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?
You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.
I mean all that stuff is so small.. ((ELAINE is wryly assessing him)) stupid..
Gee, I just didnt expect it from the way youve been acting.
I really think the M&M should be you.
We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk.
Hang on just let me pick up a paper.
Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?
Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.
That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.
(to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?
So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.
Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them.
Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift. I know, it's a label maker. The Label Baby Junior. Yeah, I hear they're good. Well, label me thankful. Okay, well you enjoy those tickets. Buh-bye.
(Fed up) Alright! Excuse me! (Gets up) I'm not buying any of this!
Okay. I'll get it. (Goes into the bedroom.)
Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.
Oh my god. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops!
You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.
"Yeah!!! What is that? I mean isn't that sick. I mean , I'd be embarrassed to have that in my apartment."
He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.
So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?
You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!
Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD.
I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?
Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) Thats it. Done!
You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.
I tell ya, I don't see it happening.
Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?
No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.
Oh, oh take it back. Let's get another one.
Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.
Yeah, killed. Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark.
How do you do? (introducing himself) Uh, Jerry Seinfeld.
Hi. Ah look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna.
Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? (hands Elaine the tape recorder.)
I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket.
I don't have any change. You've got any change?
(advancing on Gary) ...and he told me that that... (becomes indistinct)
(consternation) Oh no. (to the bedridden two) It's go time.
So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?
So, you wanna come up for a few minutes?
I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?
(thinking) Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?
So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.
All right, sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) George?
Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door.
No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up?
Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it!
Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!
We cold play Sorry! We cold play Steal the Old Mans Bundle. (Vanessa not amused; Jerry thinking) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to Vanessa) What kind of perfume is that youre wearing?
Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!
Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)
Ohh ... (takes the ticket and heads for the dressing room)
Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.
Wait a second. .Just give me a second
So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.
It's Kramer isn't it? I knew it!  The greasy door knob the constant licking of the fingers, he's hooked to the chicken isn't he?
Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.
With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.
It's over there. I know where it is.
Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.
Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.
No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.
We don't hear that. (They enter the elevator)
Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something?
Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
I dont know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three oclock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someones door and tell them to keep it down? Youre really altering your whole self-image. I mean, what am I, Fred Mertz now? Whats happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. Theres a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh... shh... shhh... shhh... Doesnt work, cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me. Some people you cant shush in a movie theater. Theres always that certain group of people, isnt it? Theyre talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They wont shush. Theyre the unshushables.
How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!
Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.
Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.
They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.
He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket books. Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.
Hey come on, you're getting it all over the floor!
I don't even know if I remember the number.
I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.
Well you know what this means, don't you?
You know 'm just curious, How did you know she wasn't my girlfriend?
I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway.
how can u say things like that over the phone?
Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.)
Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...yknow, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, its dark, theres bubbles happening, theyre all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, Cmon babe, lets go. You come by, you open up the lid and theyll- (stiffens up, as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, theyre in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, Tomorrow, the dryer, Im goin. You wait here! The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you dont see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So theyre showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isnt your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first.
(having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.
(to waiter) Ill have a cranberry juice with two limes.
Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.
Did you at least get him a card?
A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?
Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.
Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.
You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!
Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.
Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.
Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.
Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that?
What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What are you Peter Lorre?
By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.
Let's check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil.
Wow! Hey, theres Clare. I better go down.
I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?
(Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.
Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again.
I could tell you what I did, but you wouldnt believe it. Its not believable.
The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. "Who was that clown?", "I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?", "The guy's a clown!". How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, "What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!"
A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guys got a coma going like this  you dont want to mess with it.
Where did I take it? Where Did I Take It? (stabbing a knife into a cutting board) Umm, to that place on, uh Columbus and 85th. Okay?
Well, how much are you going to invest?
Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.
No in a matter of fact it isn't.
Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy.
Well my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.
All right take it easy, just take it easy.
Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm alarge.
Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!
All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm away, gets phone) now... the failsafe. The wake-up guy... (dials)
I got it! (snaps his fingers) We give the keys to Elaine.
Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we play one for all the marbles?
All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom cab.
Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
But its common sense. Hes got super strength, super speed. Im sure hes got super humor.
(After seeing how much his parents like her) Now, I'm not so sure.
George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'
(Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?
Why do I have to go on the tour?
You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?
Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction.
I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back.
(examining) Hey George, you know what? I think this crest is different. It's got a moose on it.
Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, "Make sure you hang on to your jacket."
Here. Take a look. What, what is that?
Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get in touch with you.
Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.
Oh, I cant believe it. Let me see that. (Jerry takes the paper.) Thats four and a half points in three days! Thats almost half my money!
What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?
Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.
So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?
oh I though you didn't care about his looks
All right, all right, I?ll wear this. It's bad enough I?ve got to go to the opera I?ve got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here.
Alright. (Approaches host) Excuse me, this is your party, right?
What would you say if I told you that...
He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV.
John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.
Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination? You couldn't possibly visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life size snotty puppet. I guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. That's the end of the line for a mannequin. "What ever happened to Bob?" "Have you seen that new Volvo commercial? He's got a bulls eye right in his face." Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, I guess these are the two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves. Well dressed or getting killed. I'm sure there is some pro-mannequin organization that doesn't even like you to use the term mannequin. "Hey they're not mannequins, they're the life deprived."
Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've never heard anything like this in my life. Listen to this.
So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?
I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.
I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.
You better finish your little caf latte there. They won't let you in with it.
I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?
Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley.
Yeahhh, am I imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and holds it up to Willie) Found this little cutie in the pocket. (throws the stub on the counter)
I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
(motions of making out) Well you were involved in some sort of amorous...
So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?
Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
I was. But, shes got me, like, hypnotized.
Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.
He went to get some steak sauce. Why?
Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.
What, he doesn't like my taste in music?
I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?
Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that?
Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other?
It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.
(Picks one up) Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?
Yeah, Im sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.
Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)
(Over the phone) Elaine, youve got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin me on this car, which is yellow now!
Ahh, too bad you got a little, George Costanza thing going on.
First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?
George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.
Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!
Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.
And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.
I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? (Kramer holds a broken Tony)
See I was saying "six" but she thought I was saying "sex". We straightened the whole thing out though.
Oh I dont know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing.
How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean, it's only this wide!
So what are calling me six times a day?
Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
Same as you cant overwet. You see, once something is wet, its wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die youre dead, right? Lets say you drop dead and I shoot you. Youre not gonna die again, youre already dead. You cant overdie, you cant overdry.
Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.
Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?
H... G... F. Seat four. One, two, three... f-- Hello Newman.
Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at no more than three miles an hour.
Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?
Well, Im sure you did. Who wouldnt love a pony? Who wouldnt love a person that had a pony?
How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?
Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you.
Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.
No no no, dont interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what its doing. Just let it finish.
....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together.
That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?
No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car.
Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?
The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go "Excuse me, I think you missed a spot."
I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.
That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.
Technically, you're sauted. So, what are you doing for that?
I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
Not that I would think of doing such things.
No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.
Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.
Why dont you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps.) Whats wrong?
That is a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. Some guy from NBC saw my set, he wants me to do a showcase. I might have another shot at a pilot.
Well, at least have some reaction to it.
I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin else.
Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. (Rachel shocked)
I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel.
And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya?
Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.
Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.
Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome.
Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!
Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. "Oo that little tail really turns me on."
What's going on here. How is that possible?
That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.
But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.
Get a march goin'! March it! (She exits)
I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.
If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.
Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?
This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.
(shouting) Kramer what am I going to do did you hear that that guy's gonna put a kibosh on me he's crazy he's out of his mind....
(pause) If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?
Well we went out one time. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!
I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? "You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know "No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back."
(Joking around) I think it's the stench of death.
Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?
W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.
Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?
Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read.
(Losing it, mad) Look, it's not my shirt.
No. I think it's Demi. (the "i" sounds like an "e")
I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in!
Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.
Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?
Nice Mohel picking, Elaine. You picked a helluva Mohel!
You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I give you 50 bucks.
By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?
So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots.
Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.
No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him.
So, Puddy, I decided Im gonna go with another 900 convertible.
Oh...yeah...uh you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.
The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?
(Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do?
What happened to the jacket. Did he take it with him?
See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think?
I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.
They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?
I had a very interesting lunch with GEORGE Costanza today.
Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.
Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.
(To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!
Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...
Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door behind him)
Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be? (Elaine laughs - hu) Why can't you live?
It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.
He might want a show about anything and everything.
I said pull over by the stop sign.
Go outside and see if he's still there.
Religion, my friend, thats what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that its going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.
See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. (Elaine laughs.) All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free.
Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.
(Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?
You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But its really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesnt it? "I really am a doctor you know. You think Im not, just check it out." I dont know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. "Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and Ill give you my opinion." After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what theyre talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants.
Uh, I don't know, we used to go out.
No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.
No, its not that. It wasnt all one-sided.
...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.
Um, you know, its the damnedest thing. It went away.
Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didnt like the looks of the defense and changed the play.
Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.
Well, if that's not that, what is that?
It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
(applying paste to brush) Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?
Well, I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble.
I can't go until I find my cufflinks.
They really should mention that in the breakdown height, weight, goiter.
What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one.
Happy camper , I don't hear that expression enough.
(TO GEORGE) Hey George, you ever see one?
Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal.
Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?
Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....
I cant. Im on my way out. Theres no way I can do it.
No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.
(hangs up the phone) Yeah, I really needed that suit.
Wait a minute, that's my ticket! You didn't even want to go.
(Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine?
Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?
It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.
What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog.
Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.
Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.
Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...
I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.
Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it.
Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else.
No, no, no. I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.
Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.
Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. (pause) Did you?
I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that? (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying)
(coming out from the bathroom) who was it?
Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
Yeah, I know. There's no call for that kind of attitude.
[mockingly] "Please hurry". Look at you. Look at what you've become.
George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!
I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.
Where do you suppose that could've come from?
I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.
Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?
This thing has never worked right. (holding the machine in his hand)
Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)
Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.
Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye. (Hangs up) Hey, I'm flyin' first class.
It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination. I would have killed this man. Torn him limb from limb, ripped the flesh right off his bones ...
Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.
Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.
Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.
(Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.
Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out...
Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...
That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and-
Aren't you going to take the check down?
Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log.
How could I know she would start to laugh?
Not because youre dirty, not because youre clean  just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine...
I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.
You're cut off, you're out of the loop!
Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.
You don't think she's just talking to me?
Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?
Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!
I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?
No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?
What do you think? It's like a poker game?
You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me.
All right Newman, one more peep outta you, you're out of the whole operation!
(moving over to block the door) Where are you going?
What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage death match.
No! [throws her purse back at her] No, I mean, no thank you, nah...
Should I get it? I hate these moments. Im hearing the dual voices now, you know, What about the money? Whats money?
So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?
(animated) You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I...
Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you.
Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets.
I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.
Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?
Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?
Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I?
I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I dont get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, Im not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, theyre so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, thats it! Its the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we dont know bout that, we dont know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas weve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! I dont think she likes me. The amazing thing is, that we still get women, dont we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. Thats why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like Where to meet men? Were here, we are everywhere. Were honking our horns to serve you better.
That orange dress is burned in my memory
No, we don't care, we just want to go.
"You find you need to use a lot of obscenities at the dentist.
You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool.
Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?
All right. How 'bout this one let's say you're abducted by aliens.
I said, "How come no one's killed her?" Probably shouldn't have said anything,
You're not going to open with that, are you?
That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?
It had fat in it, it's not good for you.
George got him fired. He squealed on him.
The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?
Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer.
Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one.
Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- Ill be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too.
Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats right behind the glass?
I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?
Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.
So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?
I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.
Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender! (an event guard stops them)
Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.
Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?
It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.
Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?
So what's going on with Simon? Did he leave?
You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.
I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the plot. It's embarrassing. It's an embarrassment to have to admit, but I'm the one that you see in the parking lot after the movie talking with his friends, going, "Oh, you mean that was the same guy from the <beginning>... Ohhhhhhhhhh..." Nobody will explain it to you. When you're in the theater, you can't find out. [whispering to imaginary friends seated around him] "Why did they kill that guy?... Why did they kill him?... Who was that guy? What was the... I thought he was with them? Wasn't he with them? Why would they kill him if he was with them? Oh, he wasn't *really* with them.... I thought he was with them. It's a good thing they killed him.''
Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
..living together after a while we... we might start to get on each others nerves a little.
You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.
I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, "Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me." But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?
Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.
You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.
(adamant) No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back.
(to George) Hey, there's Pat. (calls) Hey, Pat.
Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon?
But the question is, are you still master of your domain?
Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.
It's been known to happen....... telling you right now Elaine, this guy 's gonna dangle that dress in front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule.
Cause Im an idiot! You may think youre an idiot, but with all due respect, Im a much bigger idiot than you are.
Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.
No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.
Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on?
What do you think it could've been just some dude?
But you said, it can be very serious.
See ya. (Jane Leaves; after the door closes Kramer jumps in shock) what's with you?
I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.
Oh, great! Alright. (We hear the announcers calling the game.)
He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?
Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.
How many years of med school did you have?
So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, hes thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, theres nothing left?
(stands, puzzled, it's not sinking in) W-what do you mean?
Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men.
Go ahead shake his hand. You're Jerry Seinfeld. You've been on the Tonight Show.
(Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did!
Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?
Hey look at this. What is going on here?
I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?
(Pulls the note out of his pocket) That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.
Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets.
And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard-working Americans!
uh, well I can't help you there (weakly).
Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. (Holds lettuce head) Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts the intellect, represented here (Pulls off tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large piece) Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats tiny piece of lettuce)
Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . What could he do?
Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.
Just go back and ask him again. (Slams the door on Kramer)
I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?
So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?
Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.
A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions) Ho, ho, ho.
Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?
I sure do miss my apartment. Maybe I'll switch back.
Where are you going, you just got here?
Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?
(sarcastically) Yeah, Levine. And Im Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.
Um, I haven't got my watch on. It's being fixed.
Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs.
But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.
Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.
Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, that?s not fair, what about George, Susan and Elaine, what do you need me for?
Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?
(animated) Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and you sold a Cadillac?!
(looking of into the distance) I guess that's true...
(George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party?
I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.
No, see, we didnt have ponies. Im sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..
Ma! Ma! MAAA! (Hangs up the phone in disgust.) Oh, ahhhh (sighs quietly)
(seeing that Kramer has a new watch) What's that?
I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And Ill need that in the form of a question.
I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy.
What, are you serious...why, why did she call?
Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.
Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?
Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!
If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, Im telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. Im sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.
(Like an Army general) Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys.
Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.
Sex... to save the friendship. (Elaine drops her bag, takes off her jacket and walks into Jerry's bedroom) Well, if we have to (un-tucks his shirt) we have to.
I don't know. Who could've been in my apartment.
So I finally get to meet your pal Joey.
I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special treatment.
Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit.
Yeah, Im going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days.
The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.
So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show, I waited for you, you never came.
Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George.
No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 1030.
(To himself) Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over there? It's not like somebody died. It's "Beaches" for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't.
Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.
(Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.
Theres nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.
Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.
What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?
Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without.
Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?
What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again.
She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.
Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!
But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there, "Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin. Well I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on."
I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.
(Trying to get rid of her) Yes, I think it's a fine idea. Well, good night.
(to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)
Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.
Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!
And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.
"No ,Elaine and I we're just discussing whether I could admit a man is attractive."
No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.
And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.
We didnt bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.
I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.
Oh yeah? I dont believe youve seen... this.
Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.
Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off.
You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there.
Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.
Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?
...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to.
We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.
(to George) She thinks it's someone named Raef.
Don't you ever talk about her like that!
Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..
Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.
Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle...
(Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.
Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.)
Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see her tonight.
Cheque. Now, the fact is, if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, yknow, cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they dont know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster (Jerry draws imaginary book from a holster.) Who do I make it out to? Theres my ID. Theres something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I dont know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, I dont have any money, but if youll contact these people, Im sure theyll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I dont have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?
Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it.
Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?
So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?
...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.
You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...
Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it.
Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those orange cones you have on the throughway... (Sees pilot) on the way... up here... um... I..
Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?
(disappointed) Answering machine. (jovially) Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.
Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.
I-I-I don't like the opera. What are they singing for? Who sings? You got something to say, say it!
(answering machine) Leave a message. I'll call you back. Thanks.
Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?
Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.
Could you at least get a hat for me?
Sure, Beth, these things happen. (Brief pause) So, have you told many.. people yet?
Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.
(in a tuxedo) So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a woman that won't have sex with you.
Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.
Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.
I know, I just can't bring myself to do it meanwhile that freezer keeps getting smaller and smaller (she smiles) (Elaine looks at her watch) oh, don't wanna keep Tony waiting
I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.
(Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!
(to the phone) No believe me, Im always up at this hour. How are you?... Great... Sure... What time does the plane get in?... I got my friend George to take me...
Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)
Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?
The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off?
I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.
So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.
Excuse me.( gets up and opens the door)
My moms down in Florida. Shes got uh one of those condos. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?
I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.
Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!
You know, we never had one fight before this deal.
It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.
Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred!
Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers?
Well what about me! If you're going like that, I?m not going like this.
I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.
Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.
I mean, every time I see him, it's Tony this, Tony that. George is like a school girl around him
I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)
How about our little Elaine huh? Attended the finest finishing schools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions. Debutante balls. Look at her now. Interviewing Mohels.
No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?
Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.
She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.
I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.
See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.
(thinking) Thank you, Pamela! (turns to talk to Vanessa; to Vanessa) So, youre a lawyer...
Hey Kenny. (with some fake enthusiasm, just to be polite)
George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments.
Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.
Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He couldn't! (listens) Alright, I will. (listens) Okay, bye.
You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder?
Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,
You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?
Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.
That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.
We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? (turns to George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George?
Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.
Alright, Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.)
There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.
You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?
What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.
Why can't you do this on your table?
Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am  rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give...
Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?
Aah, top of the fridge. Hey George, I'm taking that waitress to the Tony's.
Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.
So youre sure youre not still angry about last night?
What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at work?!?
So he's been lying to me for two months?!
You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.
Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.
So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.
(Giving Newman a sour look) I'm just hanging out in this hell-hole because of George.
Inka-dink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink.
Well, it has nothing to do with you.
(stopping them) We better not. (they make out some more; then stop) T-They're gonna be here any second.
(pointing to napkins; to Elaine) Could I get napkin over there?
Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?
It's alright, I want you to have it.
Look, its a very awkward situation. I dont wanna be presumptuous.
Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night.
Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?
What are you doing? Were going out to dinner in ten minutes.
So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!
You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples clothes
No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.
In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?
How did you lock your keys in the car?
I didnt open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.
Ate? What? What the hell are you talking about? Now you listen to me, you get out of that apartment this instant. If you screw this up for me I swear....
What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?
Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.
You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.
Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?
I dont wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do you think?
Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?
Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.
Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.
I gotta talk to her. What do you think?
Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.
I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need "the clown" in his title, as clown? Bozo, "the" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...
But your were an executive, this is fast food.
I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?
Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
It's like we're living in the '50s here.
Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?
See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.
The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?
All right, Elaine but this is beyond news. This is like Pearl Harbor. Or the Kennedy assassination. It's like not even news. It's total shock.
And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
I got you an apartment in the building.
Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.
(In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so.
But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?
All right! I'll do it. The race is on.
I thought you just said she doesn't know??
How much money is this gonna cost me?
Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?
So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out (as mortician) 'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'. (as Mrs Costanza, horrified) Aahh!
(throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?
You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... (he spots a mailman crouched emptying a box) Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.
You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.
Ya, that's the.. last thing you want to see. Well, next to last.
At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.
I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.
Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.
Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god. Wel-- how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud.
Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--
Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why dont we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. (All three sit down) Now, look, you both find each other attractive, right?
I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You know (does the motion for the check) Check, Check. Unless the waiter isn't too shape then you gotta total it up. Sometimes they come over, "Do you want the check?" No I wanna be pen pals, can't you see what I'm doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people.
Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I?
I don't know , Who keeps track of Hellos.
So what? A lot of older men have that.
George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long.
Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?
So I can see her tonight, and you dont care?
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.
Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.
Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.
Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.)
You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?
You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift.
Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. (Faint) I don't care about that.
She'll have a cup of coffee and a broiled chicken.
Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.
Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.
There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.
(suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.
Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.
(apologetically) Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.
Oh, no. I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with it.
Well, I am sure I had a good reason.
Did you look at look at this picture carefully?
No, I tried it on. It fits good.
The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!
The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.
We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.
You know, what you need is a song you can share.
Yeah, well I don't trust this guy. I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.
No no come on really, get another one. Itll take a second.
Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something.
Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.
Let me see those. ( smells them) Oh! I know the chunky that left these Chunkies......NEWMAN!!! I've got him.
So what does he care if you put lifts in?
She might be. She's the star of the show.
Its great! It speeds up the intimacy level. Its like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish (snaps his fingers) three days.
Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
(is redialing) I should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.
You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.
Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--
Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.
(Shouting) Come on up! (Opens his door for Elaine)
(bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.
And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking?
No, but wait, wait And then you dump them off onto Kramer..
Hey, get out of here...hey officer, he's fooling around back here.
You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?
Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger.
No, I think the head does most of the stretching.
Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business.
I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.
(looking behind the counter) Hey, is that Babu? It is! (walking over) Hey, Babu!
Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.
Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner.
(waving the key) You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!
That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little off.
(hands up) I don't want it that way.
No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?
(eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.
Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)
(Shrugs) Oops. (Continues walking along the route, whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street, then keeps walking)
Ah, don't worry. I made reser... (catches himself)
Oh my God is that the new perfume?
Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.
You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events.
Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?
So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?
You know why? Because people like to say "salsa." "Excuse me, do you have salsa?" "We need more salsa." "Where is the salsa? No salsa?"
No, you stay here in the car. I may need you.
You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry?
And you want to be my latex salesman.
See, its never as bad as you imagine.
(Trying to read the note) What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit.
Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?
(While looking at posters of women wearing glasses) I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.
I love these nature shows, Ill watch and kind of nature show, and its amazing how you can always relate, to whatever theyre talking about. You know like youre watching the African Dung Beetle and youre going Boy, his life is a lot like mine. And you always root for whichever animal is the star of the show that week -- like if its the antelope, and theres a lion chasing the antelope you go, Run antelope Run! Use your Speed, Get away! But the next week its the lion, and then you go Get the antelope, eat him, bite his head! -- Trap him, dont let him use his speed!
(re the underwear pile) Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.
(Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.
Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.
Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for?
(Confirming) An alliance. (They both shake hands and laugh evily) Now get the hell outta here. (Newman leaves)
So it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato.
Kramer, (Trying to pass him) get outta my way!
Hey, look at the high score--"G.L.C." George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?
The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.
Yeah. Specifically 930 shows. Seen any good 930 shows at the Paragon, Willie?
(leafing through his mail) Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.
Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?
What is this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesnt fit him).
No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.
You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.
Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.
Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--
Well, its a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno...
(Knocking on Kramer's door) Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.
(Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.
Yes I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition...
We're here discussing our script with your father.
Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?
I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them are doing her dance as they go)
C'mon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine)
Its not promised to anybody? Cause shed take it in a second.
(getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.
Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.
I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...
Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.
This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.
Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!
Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?
(Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.
These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you?
Sure. See, things always even out for me.
I was kind of um (pauses) making out.
Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses.
I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?
Now, there's a career path you may have overlooked.
Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)
Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?
I cant. Shell get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.
I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
okay , bye (to George) What happened , did you take it off?
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.
I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.
Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.
(yell) Move to the back of the drawers!
Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
I dunno , I'm gonna ask Shelley ,but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident.
George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say,kookie talk.
Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with you?
You want to go with me to NBC?
(in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.
Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.
She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass.
Ow. Stupid fold-out! Why'd they put the bar in the middle of the bed?
Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.
So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you this thing was good!
No, I don't want that smell in the house.
Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.
So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these types of people.
Hello? Yeah he's here. (to Kramer) Hey! It's for you.
Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?
(to the Drake) So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome... (to Elaine) They loved the TV, *loved* it!
What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasnt the one.
(surprise) You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building too?
Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist.
I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!
I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.
Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.
And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.
(walking away) Well, I didn't sleep with her.
The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.
Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.
You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.
There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?
Hey, I got a real thing about "shushing"!
Well, maybe he doesn't have a "get outta here" kind of personality.
So, what are you up for? How about Mexican?
So George, how do I beat this lie detector?
Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.
The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.
That's not going to be good for anybody.
I know, and then you say to yourself, From this moment on, Im not gonna waste any more of it. But then you go, How? What can I do thats not wasting it?
Ah, here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) Mmm, delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some.
Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. I'm being audited.
Well, your day's getting more interesting already. (Jerry shows the phone) Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.
Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?
My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.
Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order.
Hey, wait a second. You know, we could share a cab. They're playing at the same Cineplex.
You know I can't get this *damn thing* to sleep. (about the Yo-Yo)
I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?
Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.
You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?
(to Rava) So, wheres this boyfriend of yours? I cant wait much longer. Ive got a flight.
Well you should hear the message from my nut. Where's George and Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, I feel very vulnerable.
Look, what do you want me to do?
You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't destroy someone else's.
Im going out. (he comes out of the dressing room, while Kramer remains inside)
Did you see the look on that guy's face?
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang"...
Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there.
Anyway, you know why I didnt ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab.
Is that your "chicken" making all that noise?
She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator...
Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side.
No, its okay now, that, that girl is not comin. Uh, I misread the whole thing.
(smiling) Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.
(Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.
Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago.
Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.
Dont worry. (whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!... Its Jerry!... Jerry!... From next door!... Never mind where I am!... Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!...
I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.
yeah, it's a damn shame, a damn shame!
(pulling out a tape from his pocket) Vvvvup. Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your feet up?
Are you nuts? You dont even know the guy.
I cant believe it! This guy ripped me off!
Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?
It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a "Tada!" gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say "I'll see ya.", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)
Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents.
There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.
The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.
Oh, Im sorry. Im just waiting for someone.
What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like theyre trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?
She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.
No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.
(realising) Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. It belongs to the Friars Club.
What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.
Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!
Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.
What! You're the one who ruined her life.
Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.
Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen?
Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune.
(extemporising) That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go.
How many times you been out with him?
Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.
(takes the card from Elaine) We had a little fight this afternoon. (reading from card) Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe.
So it had nothing to do with you.
Okay, okay. Forget it. Its okay. I didnt mean it.
Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?
What's happening? What, you doing, come and talk to us.
This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!
Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!
And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.
"Jimmy's got a record. Jimmy's jumping for dollars. Jimmt and George are gonna get rich."
Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?
Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.
Sex, thats meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; thats heavy. Thats like an hour.
Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll never get another date with her. She'll freak out.
So you want to catch a movie later?
To the Paul Simon concert in the park!
Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?
And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!
Elaine, George (introducing them to Bania with less enthusiasm)
Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...
You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.
So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry?
(thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And Ive still got another day! Ive got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. (to Vanessa) Thats a nice watch. Do you wind it?
Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.
Keep following him Kramer. don't let me down.
Didn't you see the sign on the door?
I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.
Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)
Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!
I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.
No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.
I cant believe Im gonna do this. (Jerry opens the door and exits the dressing room. He walks over to Bania)
I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
Yeah, yeah. Sometimes shes on time, and... sometimes shes late.
Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it?
(barring the way) I'm sorry. I-I don't know you.
Hello? Oh, hi honey. (annoyed, weary) Yes, I told him. I'll get it. (George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry to argue with Meryl on the phone.) Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...
I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.
The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.
What, theres something wrong with Loni Anderson? (pause) Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it.
(thinking) Whats going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, shes too good to be alone. Whats the difference, I cant maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me.
Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!
Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.
Aaa. Well ... you want something to eat, don't you?
Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.
Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.
Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!
Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! Its a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!
You can't. That's why they lose very few players.
I cant believe this. So what are you saying? You didnt like my act, so thats it?
No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy.
Good, as a matter of fact. I almost had my own show in Japan.
uh uh because then it would be all grown up.
...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the patient!
Flinched? I did not flinch. George, did I flinch?
(Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.
I don't know. That's like asking "Where's Waldo?"
Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.
Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.
So, I guess you dont find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?
I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.
Oh the baby's fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt.
What, you got a problem with the pen now?
So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought.... And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me.
(after a very awkward pause, cheerily) Hey, neighbor.
(to Kramer) It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Wheres she gonna get five thousand? She doesnt have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. Shes gone. Then you come in, Why dont you loan her five thousand? What do you care? Youve got five thousand. Give her five thousand!
you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?
(hitting metal with the first strike of the shovel) Well, that was easy.
But then we would have missed the whole thing.
(Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not.
(sharp) I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.
What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display. (takes the peanut butter jar away from George)
Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.
You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.
Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off.
I don't know, but you look like you're happy.
Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?
I once got Happy New Yeared in March.
You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!
A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business.
I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
(To himself) I don't believe this! (Walks over to a security guard) Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with shoplifting..
Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?
What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what they're saying.
What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him? I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he?
A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.
Why did you force that mint on me? I told ya I didn't want the mint!
(As George sits down) George, we need to talk.
Listen, Joel, I dont think we should see each other anymore.
I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.
Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerrys office. (Elaine is looking confused). Were going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean hes already left?
. . . All right (gritting teeth) Just give me the ticket.
It's not that bright orange one is it?
(to Kramer) Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night. (frustrated) Where the hell is that jacket?
I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.
I don't understand. What don't you like about it?
Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just wanted to pick it up.
He went back? What do you mean he went back?
You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.'
STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this? Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.
All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll meet you in front of the theatre.
(to George) Did you call me a wuss?
Shake is bad, but what if its the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?
Elaine? What does she have to - (notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.) Oh no...
Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.
I'd be very interested in something like that.
This is no good. This is no good. Call her house.
Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.
(agreeing) well three years is a long time to be married.
No, it's a nine-hundred S. (happy) It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo!
How much could you possibly have in there?
(CONT'D) You want me to help you with that?
Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.
Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.
Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank.
Thank you very much, that's great- >click< Oh! Hold on a sec, I got a call on the other line. >click click< Hello?
So was I right? She likes me, right?
You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.
So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.
What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?
But that is not what they would have you believe.
You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!
Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.
Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. (Kramer picks up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.) Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! (Kramer starts filling a pot with water.) What are you doing with that?
Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.
Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strange the whole flight?
(long pause -- did he hear "ridicurous" -- should he say something -- can't decide if he should. Finally...) Did you say, "ridicurous"?
So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.
Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.
Well I don't want to take too much off.
They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!
Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up?
(to Kramer) Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot.
Oh yeah. He's good. You know he's John Ritter's cousin.
To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in, in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in "morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? fine" Ten minutes later you see him in the hall, "How ya doin'?" Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow "Hey" You start coming up with nicknames for them. "Jimbo."
Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?
Im takin it, Im takin the place. Im gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. Im livin here...Im movin.
You had how many dates with him? Three?
Youre you. Were having lunch with Art Corvelay.
I'm not a foodie. I don't, "Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty." Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book. What is this? The story of the bill? "Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.." What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating from the restaurant? What is this about?
Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?
Hey. So, ah, Ramon this is my friend Elaine.
Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-
Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about the Costanzas'
I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.
But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.
Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks.
I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.
Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves)
Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.
So, Im on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the...
What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I
I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?
Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?
(pointing at Georges shirt) See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. Its too high! Its in no-mans-land. You look like you live with your mother.
Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?
Oh. (chuckles) Really? You don't seem that desperate.
I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. (Lena is puzzled.)
I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it.
You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.
I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm gonna try to sell the van to a lot.
That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.
So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?
Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.
oh I'm sorry I didn't get most of that.. isn't that Kramer over there?
You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now.
Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man.
He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?
Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.
Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.
If my father was moving this hed had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (as his father) 'Have you got your end?...Your ends got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your ends got to come down.'
I got one problem. Youre keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that shes coming.
I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.
If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.
Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.
Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.
So lemme get this straight you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an clair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, "What the hell, I'll just eat some trash."
No appointments at all? (motions to Elaine to move over)
Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.
I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. "The New Yorker is stealing my ideas." ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real.
(pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you lay it out on the bed.
Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!
Could you excuse me one second? Im sorry.
Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)
He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.
Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye.
The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.
It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.
Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.]
Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.
(Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here..
(doubtful) I don't know, do you have a--
Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad.
All fathers are intimidating. Theyre intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, To hell with the world, I can make my own people. Ill eat whatever I want, Ill wear whatever I want, and Ill create whoever I want.
All right. But then I can't tell you the BIG news.
Oh no. Thats impossible. Id rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.
You faked it? Why would you do that?
I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?
Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.
Well. This should be a very interesting evening.
Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.
Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)
TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.
What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?
Why'd you have to say anything to her?
(disgusted) Ohh! You know, and sometimes shell go, (imitates Marlene) Hello, Jerry? And Ill go, Oh, hi Marlene. And then its Jerry...
Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
Maybe we should get you to a hospital.
And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She says, "That's funny." ... That's funny!
Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Yea nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?
In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.
The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what youre doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? We have soda, we have soda, we have soda, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. Its a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and youre watching TV and youre drinking the exact same product that theyre advertising right there on TV, and its like, you know, theyre spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and Im standing there, Maybe Im putting too much ice in mine.
Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)
Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too.
Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, You think?
That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...
It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. "It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad." But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, "I refuse to put any thought into this at all." Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?
I'm laying down! Then we'll see how he does up there, without all the assistance.
All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape.
Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.
Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?
Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?
It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.
What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. (Hangs up)
Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on.
Well, what do you think the big holdup is?
I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life.
Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.
You know, instead, Im like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.
I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.
Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.
Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners.
(Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.
That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?
I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
Oh! There coming to town tomorrow by the way.
Well, whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.)
All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.
I noticed she's big on the phrase "yada yada."
Kramer you're going to have to face her some time
Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?
You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
All right, forget it, its over, Im not moving.
Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't get any oxygen.
Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting.
(stares at George, incredulous) "Back on"? What was it doing off?
Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)
I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?
Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10?
Don't feel right? What are you talking about?
Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.
All right, I'll see you after school. I,,m late for Hayman's hygiene.
(downcast) No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
(To Nina) Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy, huh?
This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.
Forget that. He's a ball player. MVP< 1979. I'm making wise cracks in some night club. This guy was in game six. They're a perfect match. They like go together. They're like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.
Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.
Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I?m the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me!
What, What is this? What is she doing here?
Why don't you put it in the *bank*?
I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.
I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.
So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.
Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.
I'm NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT! ..
Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?
First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.
Hell have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.
Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?
Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isnt that child abuse?
Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count on me! (hangs up)
oh you're afraid he might look like Zippy the pinhead
Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.)
I know. Im really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.
I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!
Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?
How come you're eating your peas one at a time?
Well you've really built yourself up into something.
I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.
so the woman was walking around in a bra
That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!
Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr.
Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet?
So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?
Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?
I'll tell you what happened. We got married.
(examining the label) Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.
Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days!
Oh! Rimsky -- great great book if I may say so sir. I almost read the whole thing.
Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.
Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, "This is good, who is this? I like this person". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, (pretending to wake up) "Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!"
I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.
You're meetin' the father for the first time?
It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."
(looking at the Wizard) Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents.
Kramer, do you realize what's going on here? Do you know why you're here?
What if she's got no interest in you?
Hey, hey. uh Pamelas birthday party, didnt I see you there? Jerry.
Good. And Ill tell you what... You dont have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.
You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.
Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?
Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!
Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?
George, I've been sick all week. Elaine was too. Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes. Do the math. Yeah, maybe I will get out. Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first. Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something. Yeah, Selwyn's. Okay bye.
(on the phone) Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.
Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?
I'm gonna get that. (walks across the set towards the blue curtain)
(wiping his brow) He could use a couple laughs.
So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?
There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her
No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?
You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.
Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. Alright, it's time to go. Come on.. Up.
No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.
...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're there approving new clothes.....That's a girlfriend job! How dare he!!
There's girls everywhere. I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator. They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?
He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.
Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?
You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!
Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? That's like half a pound of turkey!
No, no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts.
Is there, something I can help you with?
Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. Shes usually pretty punctual. Dont you find that, George?
Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this? (moves his arm) He's gonna think you're a mental patient.
You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake.
(to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.
On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?
(on the phone) Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye. (hangs up the phone)
I dont really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because theres that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, youre sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, Im really sorry about this. I dont know why I left that stuff over there. And thats why I could never be a maid, because Id have an attitude. Id find them, wherever they are in the house, Oh, I suppose you couldnt do this? No, dont get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldnt dust. No, this is too tough, isnt it?
No kidding. (thinking) Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!
Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?
Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.
I dont know how Im going to tell him.
So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?
You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do.
(Threatening tone) So, listen, Puddy. When we first started this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you want to play hard ball, I got my friend, George, here, and he can play pretty hard ball. (Leaving the negotiation to George) George, vein it up.
Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit?
Well, we fight a lot for some reason.
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.
Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday.
Kramer , there's no way you're sleeping with me.
Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine.
Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person.
(To George) You're off bread. (To Elaine) So what happened is it over?
(looking at the TV) Look at the picture on this thing...
Go look at your face in the mirror.
We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, hey maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!?
Well, I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.
Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.
I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.
Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.
What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy?
Elaine, see this T-shirt, six years I've had this T-shirt. It's my best one, I call him Golden Boy.
Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?
(looks round) Don't worry, I'll get you out.
"So what about the Penthouse. Did you ask him?"
(turning on the commercial) Right, quiet dignity. As opposed to, say, this?
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.
So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.
Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,
Ah, I should have got the egg white omelet.
Yeah well King Edward didnt live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.
Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!
Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, George Louis Costanza. Here I am about to go to the electric chair and my oldest friend is dating the governor
No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's.
Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and find my number.
A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?
What? (Kramer hands Jerry an envelope) My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it?
Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.
Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'
Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.
The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.
Youre gonna get back together, anyway. Its thousands of dollars!
If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened.
And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?
Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?
Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
You know, I really... Ive come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that theyre just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you dont really wanna see them. You dont call them, they call you. You dont call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you dont really have anything in common with is to pretend youre hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend theres a little desk around you. The only problem with this is theres no way you can say, Hey, its been great having you on the show. Were out of time.
You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?
Get out of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The Heart Attack')
But you gotta know how to work the projector.
You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...
He's... trying to get something off his chest.
(on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel! (hangs up the phone very disappointed)
All I said was I liked the pen!
Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here!
Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)
No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking.
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!
SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?
Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.
So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouth-to-mouth.
I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.
Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice.
No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.
Look Kramer, i-i-if I'm gonna live over there, y-y-you gotta take some of this stuff out. I mean this thing is really freaking me out (holds up a ventriloquist dummy). I feel like its gonna come to life in the middle of the night and kill me.
I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around..
Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.
First of all, I made plans with Elaine.
Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.
That's what I do with him [points at George]
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little...
Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!
Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.
Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.
Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?
I'll call back, thank you. (hangs up the phone) He went to South America!
(on phone) Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil.
Lean your head back. Open your mouth! (Grabs Kramer's head) Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!
Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested)
Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there.
Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.
Im always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice. Never quite sure, Is this the best lane for me? For my life? Theyre always a little bit ahead of you, Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there? Yeah, come on over here, pal. Were zoomin over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it. The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen? Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday well be going, (Jerry pretends hes driving in reverse.) Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. Im gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.
Hey look ,you know, you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here. You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me.
(after Bookman exits) That is one tough monkey! (turns to Elaine) So you were saying?
(Trying to change the subject away from Nina) Hey - Hey Kramer, what are you doing? You want to borrow something? You want to eat something? Come on in!
Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a "Smell Gestapo". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush...
What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them.
Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket.
No, I don't wanna see the naked people.
Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please.
Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind.
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese. (buys a newspaper out of a machine)
All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry.
(continuing to pack) That's a nice four seconds.
Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.
You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends....
No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why dont you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin anything?
(CONT'D) And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.
Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!
You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs.
Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.
The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be?
(His thoughts) I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver.
Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself.
Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?
Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that "Miss Congeniality" on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going? (Kramer enters.) Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey, what are you doing tonight?
(locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.
Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?
Coach to India - The only way to go.
You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.
No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.
(Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.
That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I got.
I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.
So as he's telling the story he starts crying.
So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head.
Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.
I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to an open box) isn't that one of yours?
But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.
Pam? What do you care? (Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying a Brentano's bookstore bag.)
Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?
Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time.
So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?
(A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.
(looking over the list) Hmm ah. I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?
Yeah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.
Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?
(leaving the room) I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much.
I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? "Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!"
(Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!
What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?
Come on! I know it's something you wanna do! (she pulls harder and he falls right off the table)
What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.
I really think you're making too much of this.
Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will.
You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.
Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though.
Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.
Cops eating Milanos. What crazy town is this?
I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?
Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.
Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?
You're lying! You got it, I want that number!
Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do?
I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...
I will, I just walked in the door.
Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.
We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!
Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?
Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person -
Hold it. Broccoli? Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce.
Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.
Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a...
Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet?
No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial.
Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)
Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?
And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.
Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in big, big trouble.
Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.
I don't know, but we don't have much time.
Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally, yeah this is Jerry,I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and..
Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...
Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.
I don't believe this. (They run into theater)
I got your message, (sitting) so I came straight from Atlantic City.
Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.
Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
Well, you know what they say. Lucky in love, Unlucky with fruit.
Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?
What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says " Aw, I'll just have some coffee." There's no truth to that.
It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.
Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it.
No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture.
How come? I told you - It's fantastic.
Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, No egg white omelets. Look at that.
Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. (They both walk to the booth and sit down. Suddenly, Gwen is attractive) Now this is a good looking booth.
I don't know what to tell you, Elton.
Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie.
No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.
No, I told you I admire your hearing.
Oh, o.k. (Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.)
Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and put it in.
You'll be out before we get the check.
It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.
(leaving; singing) She'll be coming around the mountain...
Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.
They sealed him up with the mint inside.
George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.
He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.
Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.
You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?
Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.
I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care
I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'?
Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! (Kramer exits.)
No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.
Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat)
Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.
I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.
(scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.
No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.
(Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?
You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it.
I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?
The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the other -person.
Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour.
No, Elaines got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and hes suppose to do it.
Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time.
What you must understand, Elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) Youve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.
What are you all out of breath from?
Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.
See you later. (to Elaine) Well we cant all be dating podiatrists. (Elaine laughs)
You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars.
There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals.
This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?
Vanessa, thank you. Ive been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.
Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our prices, we'll give you the store.
Now we have to buy a new couch?!
Are you sure he cant hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.
Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.
You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.
Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here.
What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!
ALL RIGHT, COME ON UP (Jerry puts his head down - he's not looking forward to Kenny Bania)
Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions.
Oh, see the baby again with the baby..
Either that, or theyve got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why dont you just go to the cashier?
No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.
Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.
All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!
Im a guy  it always looks like that.
Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.
A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little decision.
So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial?
It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.
So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George?
Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from ourselves. That's what you said.
We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy.
I think the thing I admire most about the Chinese is that they're hanging in there with the chopsticks. Because, if you think about it, you know, they've seen the fork... by now. I'm sure they've seen the spoon, they're going, "Yeah, yeah, they're OK... We're going to stay with the sticks." I mean, I don't know how they've missed it, thousands of years ago, Chinese farmer gets up, has his breakfast with the chopsticks, goes out and works all day in the field with a shovel... Hello?... Shovel! Not going out there ploughing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues.
I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.
(To Assistant) Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.
(holding up the '# DAD' shirt) We're even.
(To himself) Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. (George doesn't react) What's the matter?
Where did you come up with all that stuff?
Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.
Well, it couldnt be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?
Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.
Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie.
Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Caf Latte?
Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?
why don't you just break it off with her. tell her it's over
It's not even my car, it's a rental.
Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?
Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?
I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide.
to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?
So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.
(annoyed) All right. (after a pause) Hey, you know what's weird?
I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that.
It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
How could you leave a message like that on my machine.?
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world He's Boring.
..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beveridged!
Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.
I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
(frustrated, to self) The whole system is breakin' down!
Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.
Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.
(flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb.
What you do say about a guy like this, huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. But your loyalty is beyond question.
How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?
I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how theyre going to look at a thing like this.
Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.
Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that. (stepping over Elaine then George's legs to get to the large blue chair and sits down.)
No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.
No, "yada yada" is good. She's very succinct.
Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more.
I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.
No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.
Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.
Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?
No. So, we're still on to see uh, Firestorm tonight?
You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?
(Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla.
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!
No don't do this. You're not doing this. I will fight you. No you don't... No.
Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.
Im Dan. Can I have my list back, please?
Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.
I don't know. I just feel he should call me.
Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.
Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated.
Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...(hugs Meryl.) I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!
Why didn't you come up with your own?
Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail.
OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you know you are always welcome in my home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story.
Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.
I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!
Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?
Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.
You got toilet paper on your heel there.
How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it.
Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.
Oh (laughing) Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting.
You got a little shmootz there (picks something on her sweater)
Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!
Come on, Go in, go in! [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again]
I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?
(He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.
No, it's tarragon. Hey Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had about you having my apartment keys and everything.
Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!
(As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George.
Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.
--but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is inadvertently sent an insurance--
NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye.
You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.
Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?
I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.
Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity. 5? 3? Oh, it was just an expression. All right, well, that's very sweet of you. Okay, I'll call you later. All right, bye. Hey!
So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.
Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit.
You know, Gary (slams shut the door) I had a little chat with George the other day...
No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.
Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.
Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?
Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.
Yeah. (Kramer sits in the seat next to Jerry) Uh, uh, oh, oh, Over there. (points to the next seat over)
(Gesturing to Ellen) Kramer, George, this is Ellen.
But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship.
Hey ,You think that Shelly's upset that I made such a big deal about the pecan.
If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?
Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.
This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
(as Kramer walks by) You're a master of race relations.
What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?
Ive been thinking about asking this girl Im, uh, seeing-
Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises?
Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money.
Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry.
I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.
Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.
What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!
Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.
No ,no I don't, I mean, Don't be silly..
It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.
How late are the stores open? Im thinking of maybe uh, buying a new TV and smash it over my head.
All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.
Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George.
You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.
(a little confused) You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables?
Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going "I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?
Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set.
Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.
I can't believe your a friend of mine.
"Hey! Hey! Watch it.!... You're drooling all over the floor. How much Novocaine did that guy give you."
Fine all done, just looking for the soap.
Oh, the sisters (he sits at the table)
(to Kramer) Hold on a second. (to Morty) Hiya dad.
So you say she was on a horse?
I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.
Oh. (notices a car being jacked up by a tow truck) Hey, isn't this Kramer's car? (yelling up) Hey, Cosmo!! They're towing your car!!
It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.
Alright, that's it.. (Grabs Kramer, trying to pull him out of the car)
Were you crying? I mean, its just a grape. Youll find it.
That's the way they do it in Vegas.
Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.
He's a boy who lives in a bubble.
I bought you a Cadillac. (hands over the keys) Here you go.
(under breath) Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..
'51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?
That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want.
Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?
Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.
Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.
Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.
(Nodding, trying it out) "I'm there for you."
I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.
Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?
Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom.
(Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to look, but Jerry stops her) I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs.
(proud to Peggy, under his breath) Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. (winks)
You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.
I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.
(Handing her a small bottle) Here, drink this.
Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.
Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...
I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?
One of the problems in life is that when youre a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, I got the front seat I wanted the front seat! I called it. And the other kid knows hes got nothing to say He called it. What can I do? If there was a Kid Court Of Law, it holds up. Your Honour, my client did ask for the front seat And the judge would go, Did he call it? Well no, he didnt call- BANG! (Jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled.
Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys.
Hmm. So you feel "women and children first," in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.
(Reasoning) You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place!
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?
You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. Hmmm. What do you want?
No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.
I can't believe she threw out my napkin.
By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!
I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?
I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.
Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph?
Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.
No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.
I wonder where Elaine is sitting? I really wanted you to meet her she's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend Tony
Oh. like they wouldn't have found that anyway.
It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.
Come in for two minutes and sit with me.
Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.
Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.
Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.
George, who is that woman in the stripes?
Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.
(to Kessler) Yeah. (to the phone) Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem.
What do you think the Nazis were doin? (Imitates the Nazis salute) That was the heil-five.
Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.
What should I do, should I call the police?
Don't you see what's goin' on here???... No boxers, no Jockeys...
And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.
Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?
Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's better than eating it.
(CONT'D) What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.
Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.
Dont do the apples. Its enough already with the apples.
Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!
He never heard of corduroy! True story, true story.
No, I told you, it's just a dry run.
Well what am I going to tell Alex?
I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.
You are. I can't get that thing in my car. (referring to George)
(a la "Don Corleone") Never go against the family, Elaine.
So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!" So he says to me, "What are ya gonna do about it?"
You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.
Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll uh try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. (Goes into his room, and comes back out with the jacket on.) Ahh, haven't worn this one in a long time.
(Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical..
Alright, alright. Uh, undo them. I'll help you get them off.
Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really.
Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?
No, look, you don't understand. I, I want the picture.
We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.
That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without the cushy timeslot.
You're going out with the stationery store guy?
Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer!
Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches)
What do you mean not going? why not?
That?s what I?ll do, I?ll just call him and tell him, I?ll tell him. That?s all I?ll do. He's a human being, I?ll talk to him. He'll understand. Right?
Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?
You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.
I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" thing.
I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?
No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.
Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude.
Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.
Thats the bet! (The phone rings; Jerry answers it.) Hello?... No- oh, hi... (Kramer leaves) no, they just left... Oh, my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch em. (Jerry goes over to the window and opens it; calling out the window) Ma! Ma! Up here! Dont get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!!
If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld.
I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door...
Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.
I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.
I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.
Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time.
Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
Pretty good. I think she might be the one.
Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.
What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.
And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.
Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)
See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup...
Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.
Yeah, Ill have the egg salad on whole wheat.
No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!
Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?
Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected, outwardly.
Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it!
Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case.
You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it)
I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket)
No I can't I've got some stuff to do then I've got to meet Keith at my apartment at three. I'm helping him move.
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal, (steer).
I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give!
I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses!
And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.
I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I - I don't even remember the name of the town.
What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods.) Did he tell you whats gonna happen? (George shakes his head.) How long were you there?
So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?
Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.
I dont know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I cant decide.
(answering machine) leave a message and I?ll call you back, thanks. JOE DIVOLA Jerry, Joe Divola. *Pbt* *Pbt* *Pbt* I have a hair on my tongue, I can't get it off, you know how much I hate that? Course you do, you put it there. I know what you said about me Seinfeld. I know you badmouthed me to the execs at NBC, put the kibosh on my deal. Now I?m gonna put the kibosh on you. You know I?ve kiboshed before, and I will kibosh again.
I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.
It's a cigar store Indian. (to Elaine) Read the card.
Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?
Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go.
So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.
Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now?
Revenge date? That sound like you more than me.
I cant blame you. I cant believe she never called you back.
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place.
You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.
Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye.
Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!
Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.
I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.
(spits the nut) OooH!!! You. you ate these? You sucked on these and put them on the plate?
You want to go to Mendys, Ill take you to Mendys.
(apologetic) Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.
Who do I know who would have even been in a limousine yesterday anyway. Uhh-O h-owow!
Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?
Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...
Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?
Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.
I dont know. He said hed call back.
Lemme just check my messages. (to himself) Maybe a nicer girl called.
(Nauseated at the saying) Would you please stop saying that?!
He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.
Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.
He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris.
Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it.
Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.
Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... Im sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if...
I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.
Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may depend on it.
I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.
Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..
I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.
Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!
So she tought I did it to get back at her
No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station.
But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.
Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?
So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?
(Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-
So get this we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.
No, I had to tell my friends  my friends didnt have to tell you.
(talking to Beth on the phone) Could you put him on, I'd love to say hello.
Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up)
I did not. You guys gonna go through some red lights?
Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!
(Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after him!
All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.
The main thing is to keep the line moving.
(hands it to him as he asks ELAINE) So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
O.K. from now on I want you to call me "Jerry the Great".
So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the Spokes model category?
Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to begin with! Let's face it. I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's that!
Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years.
No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.
I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?
Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.
What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?
I like that. (He opens the closet. Elaine walks out with an angry look.) What do you think, George?
Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way.
There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.
(Kramer waddling out the door) Maybe you can soak in the tub.
Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time.
(on the phone) Hello? No, Im sorry Bania ... Im not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye.
Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car!
That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.
I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.
402? (Checks his wristwatch) Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup!
Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. (opens the fridge and gets a bottle of water.)
I just thought ahh maybe I could talk to Roy, if um
Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!
Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.
Wow, look at you. So you got the job.
Okay. (closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self) Didn't come true.
What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?
George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!
Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, (has his one hand up and his other hand down) he was down. Now he's up, (switches the positioning of his hands) you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?
"Of course.... But that's got nothing to do with it."
So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. Whats the matter?
How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!
(Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.
No, no, no, another race - out of the question.
The wheels are in motion, things are happening!
Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that.
(Unsure of what to say - he remember's Leo's courtesy tip) Hello?
Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em.
Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.
I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.
Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before. Your hook is too small. This is for, like, a muffin. All right. Take it away.
The apple pie you had today at Monks
(stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem?
...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana...
Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania)
Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. (Slams the door on Newman's face. Then tries to delay talking to Newman by keeping the conversation with George going) So, you want a protein shake, or something?
Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.
Well, then Im not going to the game either. Okay? Ill give him both tickets.
I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..
She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.
Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
After one date you try and improvise on her machine?
Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.
Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead.
They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.
She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
We dont understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you cant stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I dont see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, lets make up our mind where we think theyre going.
It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.
I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.
I gotta say, thats pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.
No eight years isn't such a long streak.
(Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script?
You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?
Yes. I do love her. (to baby) You have a very nice place here.
Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!
We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.
All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier. (Elaine drinks straight out of the orange juice container) Hey.
I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? Thats what I want to know. I mean, its the championship, Im hitting everything.
Yeah, I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her.
I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for him for a second.
Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.
I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.
Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.
You stink. You know you stink. What is this?
You know, I think I'll just take the check.
Well, I'm very mysterious by nature. (Jerry knocks on the door) A lot of women find that attractive.
I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg." But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, "Would you mind?!"
Okay, how about this I'm in my apartment, you come in.
People are going to steal from you. You cant stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker, whos gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They cant get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.
You know, if your future was a little more certain..
Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.
Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.
Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?
Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe well get together.
Yeah, theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.
Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're puttin' it in my box now.
What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present)
You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.
Can I make it up to you? Ill give you fifty bucks for the jug.
You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial.
(rising) I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the speed-dial.
Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.
Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.
(Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the 80s, and its still relatable today.
It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ...
So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up The good, the bad, or the ugly.
Look, let me just give you the forty, plus another twenty for your trouble.
I think I may have made a big mistake.
Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!
So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner?
'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.
I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.
I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to Jack)
No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.
You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?
What did you do the rest of the day?
yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas..
If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.
That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. (goes knocking on Kramer's)
A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!
Ah, just, you know, I don't know. Stuff, I gotta do. (grabs coat and throws it over his shoulder)
I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.
Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.
You know what? That was the amazing thing.
The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.
I'll see you tonight. (he's opening his door apartment as Kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe)
(interrupting) "Elaine , I really don't...............pay much attention to men`s faces."
Well, would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.)
I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.
Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?
Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series.
Just get the key and let's get out of here.
Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what youre talking about, now, come on, come with me. (stands up) I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.
What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?
Fifty years they were married. Now hes moving to Pheonix.
I don't know if they have land guys.
Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?
What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him?
I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.
What are you talking about? It's my car. Let me pay for the gas.
Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.
You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.
I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.
Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?
How ya doing? (George nods) Can't talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his brace) Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his eyebrows) I like that. (George sticks his tongue out) So how's life without tonsils? (George quickly indicates with his arm that he wants ice cream) What? What's that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?.. (George signals that it's more) Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy.. (George motions for ice cream again) What are you doing?
The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.
I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?
We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?
Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--
(to Elaine) Where's Kramer? Shouldn't he be here by now.
(reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.
No, absolutely nothing. (They get up to leave) You're fantastic! (They meet up with Kramer and George on the way out) Hey guys!
No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.
(uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.
You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.
(to the phone) Hello yeah yes it is really ah, ah Could you hold on a second? (to George and Kramer) Hey listen to this, some woman found an electronic organizer, my name was in it, she wants me to help her track down the owner.
(bored) Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it.
And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry)
Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her Im sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.
No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman.
They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
But then anyone can just look in and see you.
It's not one of those 976 calls, is it?
(admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.
They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.
Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.
Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?
Well, theres this uh, woman might be comin in.
The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.
You dont think it mightve had anything to do with that?
Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.
How many session did my parents paid for?
Okay... but theres no cake or anything, if thats what youre looking for.
Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?
I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)
(with no emotion) It's okay. Everything is going to be all right.
Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.
Well yes I did that's true. A couple of a guys I knew in the coastguard told me about her.... and I sensed that she had the anger and intensity that I needed to make this film work.
He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly . I would like to have a good show.
(proud of himself) Remember me? I said I 'd come back with someone and I did. Surprised?.
Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?
Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.
I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.
Sure. (points at booth) How about this one?
(Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?
Oh, what about this one? Look at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for. (Sits on the couch.) Oh, yeah!
(on phone) Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago.
I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.
Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this?
This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes) Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?
Hmm, I really need to speak with him.
He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. (Mimics brushing his teeth) Away from the gums... (The door opens a little, George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and Elaine, then enters.)
... if this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this woman to help me I would have killed this man. I would have strangled the life out of him with my bare hands
I don't think the network will go for it.
Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?
And she was beautiful in that bra! I'm crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging, free wheeling attitude!
I was going to say, "Being a good host."
(Pointing out) It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for "Avast ye matey" - what the hell does that mean?! "20 degrees off the starboard side - the Spanish Galleon!" - there's no comeback for that!
Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.
How 'bout if it was something like " I can't find my receipt my place's a stye.
Because you were too busy stealing a book.
What do you care? You don't believe in hell.
Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.
What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in it's path.
youre a real pleasure. (Jerry is being sarcastic)
Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?
So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.
You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.
I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.
Whats the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!
No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!
Yknow Im sorry you had to leave so early the other night.
Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?
(exasperation) You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents.
Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that canvas?
(in a hurry) Ya how you gonna get all this done in time?
Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves, wanted to come home and start working on his floor.
But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.
Kramer! (tries to hide he's upset and jealous)
So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?
Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited.
(to George) You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! It's crazy Joe Devola.
Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.
Thats not too bad. Its not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it.?
The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)
That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
What do you mean? They know we're here.
Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that.
Ah, just remember when you see him tomorrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him.
An inch! Can you move over an inch?!?
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?
Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!
No, its not you. Its your stomach, hes taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
(Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.
Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?
[To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.
Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.
Come on up . (looks at his watch) ...What's he doing here now?
Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.
In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.
Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted.
Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before.
I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.
Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.
(thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.
(to the phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)
Jim Fowler? The animal guy from "Wild Kingdom" is coming to your apartment?
I did. Im just curious. Its been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points? (to Vanessa) Its up six points!
Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people.
You know, I really need to use the bathroom.
Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did!
No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!
(Joking around) Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.
And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.
Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something.
Right. For the reducing of the pond scum?
I don't have your suit. I gave it away.
I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.
That was brutal. I cant go back out there.
Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I dont feel comfortable in them.
Hello, oh hi Duncan, 400 o'clock tomorrow? That is not going to work. . . . Why? I'll tell you why. Because I chose not to run!
Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?
Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.
(cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You havent been out of the building in ten years!
Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.
(to George) So did you bring the lease? (George takes the lease from his inside pocket and hands it to Jerry.) All right, gee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time.
No you can't. (hangs up the phone) Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?
I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...
(Pointing) I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.
Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?
Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?
(into the phone, with a disguised voice) So, what's going on?
Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over this whole operation!
Is it...? Could it...? Could he have...? IT IS! (Grabs Kramer.) Poppie peed on my sofa!!
If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened.
I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.
Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.
You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while, no matter how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because they're crawling , crawling on your skin. Up your legs , up your spine , up your back.....
I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home.
So you were talking, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") you're having pleasant conversation, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") then all of sudden...
How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet!
I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?
No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.
D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?
Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.
Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.
Uh, yeah. (broaching a subject) Hey uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to a meeting.
It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck!
What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?
I guess they leave that up to the general population.
I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.
What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back.
Yeah. (subdued) I don't think this is the jacket.
Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there.
Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.
He's been sleeping a lot. He's still groggy.
So, are you gonna go out with her?
Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal.
Actually, we met in the gym locker room.
I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!
Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.
Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.
Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.
To wash my hands. Theyre sticky from the orange.
(interrupting) No no it's ok. (walking Rachel out) So we'll go see Schindler's List later right?
Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?
Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.
I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright*, I forgive you...
Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?
You're going to make a good father someday.
Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle?
Dirt? That's alright, (for Jenna's benefit) because there's nothing wrong with dirt.
I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
So, can you believe that message? Now I?ve got to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.
I can't go to sleep at nine o clock!
Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.
Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.
I didn't know it was possible not to know that.
Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. (They go out into the hallway and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.) Hey, how ya doin.'
Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.
(Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really?
Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?
Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.
They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same.
This is Outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit.
The Improv is playing "Rochelle Rochelle" The musical.
Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to rides alone.
See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.
So, tell me anyway. Who was the BIG mastermind?
Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. (Hands over Kramer's quilt.)
No economic reason for them to be here.
I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!
Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going "boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly."
I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.
I thought you said you were a good driver!
(Nervous laughter) Yeah.. like a pirate.. (Attempting to get on another subject) Anyway, ah, you know, we're hoping to, um, raise enough money.. with this.. uh..
Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?
I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.
(ranting) I can't believe how a little thing like George going too fast - and my whole weekend is gone - the plans, the packing, ... everything.
So you dont know whats wrong with him?
(to the phone) Hello? (disappointed) Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) No. Uh, I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesnt know anything. Hes just my next-door neighbor. Uh, nothing much... Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. Im meeting somebody... Uh, Wednesday? Wednesdays okay... All right. Uh, Im a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning?... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone.
I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble. I'll do it myself.
I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I cant stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion wont even exist. It wont. I think eventually well all be wearing the same thing. Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where theres people from the future or another planet, theyre all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided, This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and boots. Thats it. We should come up for an outfit for Earth. An Earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits. No speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, That was nice. I could wear that.
No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me. She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised what's going on.
Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe-- "Jerry Jerry Dingleberry", and-hu "Seinsmelled"...
Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?
So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day?
I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.
I'm not talking about upside down. (Jean-Paul and Kramer come in) I'm talking about waking him up!
Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.
Thanks, because I would really like... (distractedly puts coffee cup back on the table)
Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex.
I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.
Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.
Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.
(trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.
What is it she think you can't do?
(Resisting) Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I-I can't wear this!
Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)
Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.
I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
(upset) Ohhhh, what are you doing? Kessler, its a tape! I taped the game, its one oclock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.
Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...
So why don't you leave it at Newman's?
This has 'international incident' written all over it.
Uh huh. When youre on a stakeout, do you find its better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?
You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go 'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.'
Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.
Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.
Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?
And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?
(calmly getting up with plate of chicken) Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, (drops chicken into sink) was, for two.
So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.
What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.
Oh, Im sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.
Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you?
Of course not, if I did would you have gone?
Damn, I was too overanxious, he must have noticed that.
I dont bother with him. Hes been calling me for seven years. Ive never called him once! Hes got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if hes paying attention.
(as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.
"I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery."
Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.
Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. (Newman considers the implications of this.)
May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" across the painting)
(Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together?
(still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)
I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy could write checks to himself right out of my account.
Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.
Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much. (To Kramer) I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!
George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, ok...do we know where the 101 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 170 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 134 is? (George just looks at Jerry) No. Aha, ok. (Jerry hangs up) He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up.
Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.
Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.
(Pulls a small bottle out of his pocket) Uh-huh. Hey, look what they had on the plane. Schnapps.
Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.
(disoriented) How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?
I dont give out bites. I got another one. But Im saving it for later.
And she wants to break up with you..
No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?
Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?
Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than "coffee machine show."
Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.
Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.
So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.
Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.
In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.
Oh, really. (Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.)
Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?
I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
(struggling to open a bottle with his bandaged finger) I can't do it. (A LA GODFATHER) Look what they did to my boy, They massacred my boy.
Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.
I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go "Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!"
We'll see about that. (Runs to the window and shouts up to Kramer, who's on the roof.) Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win!
oh uh nothing, she just.. choked on a jujube
(taking out his wallet and handing over bills grudgingly) Fifty dollars.
I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing.
Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?
We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.
Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again?
Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton. **
You are the Queen of Confrontation. Youre my new hero. In fact, youve inspired me. Im gonna call George about something right now.
Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me (flustered, he indicates a nose pick)
I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?!
O.k., good, I'll see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.)
Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, that's it. They go to the next show.
But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.
Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?
Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.
By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine)
Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it is. (vehement) Just take it!
The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?
Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!
I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y. (he spits it into the waste bin)
Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way.
Im not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. Ive decided Ill do the work. Im gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? Cause you send your money out there  working for you  a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me. Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.
yeah without a doubt, I'm down (Kramer enters) oh hey how're you doing? Jane this is my neighbor Kramer
(Stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. (Approaches the intercom) C'mon, let's get it together.. (Through intercom) Yeah?
(Stops) Alright, that's not gonna work, it's not gonna work. Let me just think for a second here.
Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!
Okay, take it easy. (hangs up) That was Keith. we're going to do something next week.
Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)
Hey you know we were just talking about you.
Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?
Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.
Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?
Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie "Cinderfella". I got 'em at an auction.
If I like their race, how can that be racist?... Hellooo??... Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!... Yyy-yes, I am calling George... Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!
Lemme see if I understand this. In other words, you held out
Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it.
As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protg of my own.
Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.
My whole night's ruined. I didn't do any sets, didn't do any movies...
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.
Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.
Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.
Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.
Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.
Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?
Oh, excuse me... Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.
Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!
Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing."
By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.
Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.
You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.
You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
(bewildered) Why would she try and kill you?
Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.
Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.
Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.
Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!
He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.
All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar).
So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...
No, I do not like the bank. Ive heard the expression Laughing all the way to the bank. I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when theres nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, its empty and you still have to go through the little maze. (walking on the stage like he is going through a maze) Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? Im almost at the front. Id like a reward for this please.
Oh, they're all the same. Here. [gives him Dust Buster] Now if you'll excuse us, ..
My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!
Well, go in there and talk to her. She's not going to put em on the glass.
Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?
Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drakes coffee cake
I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?
Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.
Yeah. (pointing at Elaine as he goes into the bedroom)
Well how long you are going to keep this up?
No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him.
If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!
I know. He got the hit in game SIX. So, so then what happened?
You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
Hello Elaine? Patty Lawrence had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?
It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman!
How'd you expect to get out of here?
(to Mickey) Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?
You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...
The uh toilet brush is under the sink.
George is pickin' us up at the airport.
Okay.. (Opens the door to a frantic Elaine)
Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.
Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.
Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order)
Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought.
And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant? Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it in there by helicopter, you know keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. "We got the hair but I think we lost the Zest." ....rejects the transplant with organs. Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . Guy just standin' there and suddenly... ..Bink! ( motions hair flying out of his head)........lands in someone's frozen yogurt.
Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up) Since I said what?
Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.
(Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off George, and puts it back on his bed)
What happened to your head when you got hit?
Who's got a tissues? I need more tissues! Look at this thing. It's my phone finger!
It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.
Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the sirens song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?
(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!
I don't get this. How did this happen. I don't have a dog.
Back and to the left Back and to the left
So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo?
They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.
Hey, it's one thing if I asked you "Could you do me a favor?" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE (Obviously up to something. Jerry doesn't suspect anything - yet) Whey you told me what you went through on the plane, it makes you stop and think. You appreciate having a real friend.
Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet.
Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey)
What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.
Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- Zip, I'm gone. (makes a running motion with both arms and his right foot)
So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing?
Yeah, dont investigate, dont pay me back, it was an accident.
Just put a coffee table book over it.
Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?
Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.
That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record.
I don't know, opera, it?s not my kind of thing.
And that waist cincher, that was the topper!
No, its, its just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it. (Jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) Ten-fifteen... No, dont be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, its no trouble at all... Ill see you tomorrow... Great, bye. (He hangs up the phone; to Kessler) I dont believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here!
Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?
I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!
Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?
That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.
He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. He's a time slot hit.
(a la "Don Corleione") Elaine, never ask me about my business!.... (SHEEPISH) "Godfather."
Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?
So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building?
I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?
(looking at Kramer's moustache) Uh, we're not doing that anymore.
He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about "Jerry."
Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!
Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy. You don't have to mention the bubble boy? I know about the bubble boy. I'm aware of the bubble boy. Why do you keep reminding me about the bubble boy?
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?
You know what? I'll be with you in a minute.
Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket.
Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.
No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.
I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.
Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?
(on phone) But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.
Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.
Hum, well it all comes as news to me.
She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was "Beaches" for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?
Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?
Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by the big showcase tonight.
(into phone) Hello Joe, listen this is Jerry Seinfeld, I really think there?s been a huge colossal misunderstanding,
You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner.
Its raining? Its raining. The game will be postponed. Well play tomorrow.
(placatory) Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me.
...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code.
You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.
Which part? The renovating the restaurant you dont own part or spending the two hundred million you dont have part?
(Joking around) Hey, didn't I beat you up in the fourth grade?
You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.
It's gotta have something to do with Kramer
"...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!"
you know, I think George has a non-sexual crush on him
Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.
Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary.
I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.
Hey, what happened to your coat? And what is the smell? Is-ya, What are you drunk?
You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.
Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear?
Let me have a look at this thing.
Thats not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table repeatedly.) You know, maybe its not that bad an idea.
Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.
everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah?
If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.
Yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder)
All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.
There's no watch ... I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep good time. My parents gave it to me, but I didn't like it. So don't mention it again, okay!
So ah, what did you do last night?
Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.
No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!
Uh-huh, yeah. (Smiling, nodding, clearly wanting Bryant to shut up)
(handing his dad a gift) Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.
He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.
I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life.
You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.
(sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand.
You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.
Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
(impatiently cutting in) Hey Elaine What about the crest.? What d'you think of the crest here.
Aw! You'll be fine, you were in there for what , a couple of minutes.
Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa.
Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?
Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.
(Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.
A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in The Blob.
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.
So what did you do there all day?
(turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isn't that your charter group?
She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love!
(doubtful) Yeah, you'll make it up to me.
Alright, sit down, sit down. (Grabs a pill from the bottle, and starts advancing tward Kramer - like an owner with his dog)
Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's uh yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it?
This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.
She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.
I don't mind at all. Why should I mind? What did he say?
Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.
An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. (Elevator doors open) Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. (Everyone but Jerry is now in the elevator. Jerry's still addressing them) Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?! (Elevator doors shut. A few people in the hallway are looking at him, he turns and addresses them) I am not an animal!
He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?
(Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.
No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?
I dont know. Its got a pink lining.
It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.
(seeing Kramer struggle to open a soda, spilling it all over) I think the damage is probably already done. (interrupting Kramer's inadequate attempt to clean up the soda) All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene.
Good, going good (scratches chin) And the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty good - not bad - I gotta get out. (scratches chin, nose then covers eyes with hands)
I kinda like this opera crowd, I feel tough... Anybody else got a problem?
Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.
No, no. It-It's really funny. There's these two guys-
Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?
What do you mean? Why wouldn't I know his name?
Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. (pointing at the umbrellas) What've you got in a push-button mini.
(Sarcastic) Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.
The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.
All right, all right. Whats the big hubbub, bub?
(finishing) The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.
All the time. Ive been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I cant live like this. I dont know what Im gonna do. Im heading for breakdown! (to Harold) Cant you do something?
You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)
I, I'm not happy with what I wrote.
Evry-Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. "Oh, is he good?" "Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best." They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, "You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. No, he's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher." And then there's always that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me." Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, "Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. And everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."
So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!
A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!
(Walks over and starts pulling on Kramer's pants) You just gotta wiggle your hips a little bit.
Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.
Excuse me, uh...dentist? You a dentist? (The guy shakes his head. Jerry moves on to another guy.) Dentist? Are you a dentist?
(taps George's chest) Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six.'
Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye.
Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!
So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, "Jerry"? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They're putting it on the air! They're giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California!
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em. (starts backing away as Kramer follows him around the room carrying the underwear)
Whats with the pink lining and the candy stripes?
No, I dont eat dinner. Dinners for suckers.
Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.
Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing and
But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.
Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.
No Elaine he's normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York.
More cereal? that's your third bowl today, you had it for breakfast and lunch.
But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.
They're ladies' glasses! You know all you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.
Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
Is that like the end of the world or something?
I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.
Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! (Kramer is speechless) I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet.
I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.
Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.
So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.
The average person in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.
Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.
(Chuckles) You don't know the half of it.
Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...
All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?
"I don't think so. I think they were getting dressed and not only that; my shirt was out!!!"
How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?
He's got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, Jerry notices one of the movie goers) Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?
Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.
How can you think of food at the time like this?
Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's got this strangest habit. She eats her peas one at a time. You've never seen anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. I mean, we've had dinner other times. I've seen her eat Corn Niblets. But she scooped them.
(thinking to himself; picks up a tube) "Fungicide". Fungus?
We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie.
(getting looks from his parents) Not you. Older people.
Oh, Okay (turns to rest of table) Im sorry, I didnt know what to bring, nobody told me.
I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!
Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. (Joel shakes his head agreeing; Jerry smiles) You know, its their annual terrorist luncheon.
Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.
(Reads the pill bottle) What kind of pills are these, anyways?! "For Smuckers"? "May cause panting and loss of fur"? (Turns to Kramer) These are dog pills!
The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.
So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--
Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--
I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend.
You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go... up.
Yknow what? This is not that bad an idea.
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed...
Yeah, yeah, take care of it. (Jerry throws her some toilet paper) Come on, George, what is it?
Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?
Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.
Kind of in the middle of something here, George.
I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?
All right, what are you gonna say to him?
Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.
That's what a gym teacher once told me.
Well if he's going then I'm not going.
Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.
We're in the middle of a discussion here.
So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?
Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room, searching for the TV.) ELAINE!
Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?
She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. [sarcastically] I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... >click click< Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? >click click< I'm back...
Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.)
Thats the bet! That youre not doing it!
No, believe me it's not good. I'll mail you a new one with something really funny written on it.
You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back.
No, no......(long pause . they stare at the walls) Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?
This is insane. You know, I dont even know where shes staying! She, shes not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.
See...women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel...
How would you describe the smell in this house?
You know what? No champagne. Anyway. . . I'll see you later.
I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.
(answering) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Um, its for you.
Oh, I was just looking for er, some... gum or... mint.
So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)
You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!
Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?
No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.
I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.
Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy.
Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 1130.
Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.
Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno.
Oh, well, I didnt actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into him there. (putting on coat)
Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours?
Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.
It's been three days and he hasn't called.
It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.
Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.
(trying to shut the trunk hood) Something wrong with this trunk.
I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers.
. . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?
I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.
(thinking) I cant believe it. I got nothing! I dont even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...
Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other line. Just a second.
Did you say, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show" or, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"? (Elaine comes over.)
I thought youre like Hitler in the bunker?
So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?
No I can't she didn't leave her name or number.
How can you talk to someone like that?
(to Bania) Excuse me. (he goes back in the dressing room)
I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.
Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.
What was I supposed to do? You knew I was on my first date with Elaine. You come barging in here asking me to contribute money for a volcano relief fund for krakatoa.
All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.
So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?
Well maybe he's got like a, cheerful mental hold on you.
So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?
No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.
When did you get tickets to see that?
That voice. That voice. Shes driving me crazy.
You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.
So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh?
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!
Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?
All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now, be reasonable you cannot turn down $50 for a $6 rye.
Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!
Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, Ill see ya.
Come on. Then you dont have to see him again til my 15,000-mile check.
Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?
Well, the mans an individualist  he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what hes doing.
Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I-I just wanted to ask you a question when we we're going out did you have orgasms?... Okay, thanks... No that's it... Ya, Okay, bye.
Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.
Already? That was fast... I assume he's not a High Talker...
You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!
Course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.
Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.
Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job.
No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.
...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.
Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, its with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I mightve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.
I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.
(to the Barneys sales associate) Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?
Uhm, hold, hold on a second. (pauses counting) I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.
People dont turn down money. Its what separates us from the animals.
I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?
Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly) and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it.
You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?
You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 950, I'm not gonna be able to make it!
Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you.
Vandelay Industries, Kel Varnsen speaking. May we help you? ... Oh Hi Keith. Na, I was just jokin' around
Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is.
All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a mnage  trois with her and her roommate.
If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.
I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?
(Fast) Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me!
I was ready to get jiggy with it.
Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.
If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.
Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what are you doing?
Because you know we used to go out.
No, no I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like the title and insisted that he change it to "War and Peace"!
I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
hey where were you last night? I looked for you, I didn't see you
OUR LIVES!! . What kind of lives are these? We're like children. We're not men.
So why didn't you tell her the code?
Don't look at him. (Phil starts to knock on the door)
I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. Shes going to move in.
Come on. Something's on your mind. Out with it.
Well put something down, youre taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac and Artie, theyre all coming over here before the wedding?
Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
(turning to Elaine; thinking) Oh no, not now.
How's life on the red planet? (shuts door)
(walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.
Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?
Oh, I know her. I know her type.
I'm sorry. Got any booze? What's say you and I get ripped!
Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?
He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. "I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"
People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression 'The best revenge is living well' I've said this, in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice, doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him, 'Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting, french doors, a divan. That'll show those punks.'
What causes homophobia? What is it, that makes a heterosexual man, worry? I think it's because, men know, that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, "Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'"
But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.
Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.
Well I started screaming, "There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina." Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running (In the background -- CLERKS VOICE 57) and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.
There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.
Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.
But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.
(Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
Oh, heh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.
I would like to know what my names doin in this creep's organizer to begin with.
You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...
Someone says, Get out of my life, and that doesnt affect your appetite?
Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.
It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?
Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad.
[rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your point!
A few stitches? I've never had stitches. I'll be deformed. I can't live with that. It goes against my whole personality. It's not me!
No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.
How am I going to live with myself?!
Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.
You spent the night at James's? Did we?
All right, bye. (to Elaine) You see this? Any thought pops into their head they're calling me because it's a local call now.
Aah! .. right. The ones from Oregon that are only ripe for two weeks a year..
Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.
Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!
OK ... (nodding his head up and down) This is it cha know
You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?
"Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable..." Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been "outed"! I wasn't even "in"!
I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer?
I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!
I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now.
No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?
Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.
Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?
Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.
Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me.
I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting.
Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.
Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses... I need an awkward pause.
(to Elaine) I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog. (to George) Get this one "I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest".
Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just "recede into the night," if you know what I mean.
It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.
Especially when you got a layover in Sarajevo. (Bosnia Herzegovina)
Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.
So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?
Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?
It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook?
Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a, its a little crumpled.
And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?
Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up!
On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?
Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?
No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-
George! Can we focus on the car, here?
Oh that's George. (presses the intercom button) Yeah?
It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.
I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation.
Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.
No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex.
(picking at his moustache) You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.
Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up(?). Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.
It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?
Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation.
It's stuck. (pained) Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood.
(sits on the back of the couch) Oh my god.
It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.
Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.
No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!
This is a person I like, its not How to score on spring break.
What I said. Ive been under a lot of stress.
Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss.
So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?
No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.
Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.
I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?
(Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that line?
So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.
George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?
Oh! but I do. There's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar. ( as he says this Newman is wildly scratching behind his back. he suddenly stops when Jerry turns around)
We won. Were in the finals on Wednesday.
Y'know a lot of people have asked that...
(Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) It'll be on your conscience.
Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.
Wait 'til I tell him about the book.
I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all.
All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go.
(To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up)
Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?
Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!
Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine.
Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand.
Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand and put it on his shoulder)
Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...
I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I cant imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but thats me. Alright
(To Amy) Aha! So it's true! You were making out with him!
Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.
That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother.
He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.
Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?
Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.
I had a statue! What should I do?
C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!
How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a minute. Poppy's from Tuscany. I'm gonna go call him.
Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it!
Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up)
It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.
He really did an amazing job. Look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid! (Jerry opens refrigerator.) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups! Come here, look at this. (He gets on his knees and points.) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there?! He must be like Rubber Man!
And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.
Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.
I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.
She wanted to thank us for the apartment.
I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it.
I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.
Hi. Hi Winona. Nice to see you again.
About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?
How do you like that? (tries to turn away again; thinking)Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I cant, I cant. Im stuck.
Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.
I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.
You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?
So I guess , you're not getting married?
No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.
Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.
My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin' "where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?"
(pause, to Donna) You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name...
Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I cant ask her.
Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.
Dont you think she woulda heard I was there?
I don't know. What if I get caught?
But you know... not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me.
Yeah. You know, kind of a peace offering. Cute.
I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.
What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?
I don't know him. I know who he is.
There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing.
No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.
Oh! man did you see that. I ate discarded food.
Of course he did ..The guy's working ya.
I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.
Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!
Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.
All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.
Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.
And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.
oh look at that I got oil all over me. Can I have your napkin?
Elaine got a new number because she died.
Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.
(interrupts)like a shark fisherman with a bucket of (?) Ch....
They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?
We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it?
You asked a date to go to the operation?
So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?
Y-You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set!
No, I kinda tried to test his hearing.
wait, where are you going? where are you going?
Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?
Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing. Perhaps it's an homage.
Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?
Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.
George- What?! Youre kidding... Well, whats wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, Ill speak to you later. (He hangs up.) Wilkinson, the guy whos supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, hes in the hospital.
(flips a roll of paper towels in the air) Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.
Yeah!.. Thanks.Oh! my god you saved my life.
No, George was there, he said he had a great time.
Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment. How 'bout I make it up to you with dinner?
Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.
Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?
(thinks) Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize?
(to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!
Yeah. (hands racquet to Kramer) I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it.
I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating.
Girls. There's girls right here in the store. Look, look, there's one over there. Look, there's another one. Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there. What's the matter?
Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment.
I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.
Do you even know what this scene is about?
Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.
Wouldnt it be great if you could ask a woman what shes thinking?
Why, what's wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders)
Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?
Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model.
They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.
Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.
I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.
You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? When I'm on stage that's all I hear; You stink, You suck. We like magic.
So what are you going to do with the mattress?
So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.
(Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) "Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone." (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out "Just go" while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. (Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her.
Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game.
Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me.
You're lucky they let you drive a car.
Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.
Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!
(dialing) He got em out of the house.
You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.
You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.
(Making nothing of it) So? Who cares about that?
Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it.
Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?
Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.
You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?
Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh
(gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!
(reading on) "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-"
Why would I leave? This is my apartment.
Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, "You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"
Let me see that. (Jerry looks at the tag.) That is high.
Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser.
Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?
A half hour, give me a half our.
Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.
He was buying quite a load of chicken, almost for two people ...
I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it.
(Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.
Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.
Come on up. (Jerry presses the second button and opens the apartment door. He walks back to the couch.) Oh, all right, forget it, Im gonna take it with me now... (He picks up the cushions.) Im just gonna pack up the cushions right now...
He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught.
The one Puddy screamed at in the car?
You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.
By the way, just for the record -
(Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!
Could you make a little more noise? (To his parents) Listen, I'm gonna have to call you later.
Well, that's it! Tonight's the night. I'm getting one. No "if and's or but's".
(Thinking) What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship. Gotta relax.
So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy.
Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.
(watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this?
So you lie! What did you tell her?
I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
I don't know how long this is gonna last.
Elaine is having a "houseguest." She's picking him up at the airport tonight.
(turning to Kramer) That's nice for the freaks.
(looking after the guys) That nut is always up to something.
I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?
Oh my god, he knows. (Jerry and Gino scrambling) Go. (yelling to the door) One second.
I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...
So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.
What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?
Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.
And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
I just want a, touch em a little.
Hey look, there's a spot right in front.
Oh, Hey, there's a name you don't forget.
Yeah , she's coming to see my act tonight.
I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. (Picks up the phone and dials.)
You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem.
Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going "Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going."
I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy.
Sure, its like robbing a bank. You dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.
No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?
I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.
Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?
Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for show.
Yeah, so Joey?s a great lover of the opera
They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again.
Yeah.. how about this I say "How's it goin'?"
Is there a captain's hat involved in this?
Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here...
You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!
No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.
You see , I kept up my end of the pact.
What are we doing out here? Aren't we going to go in and eat?
(noticing Alec Berg walk in, whispers) Hey, Alec!
Listen to this "I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."
I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.
Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters)
No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing. (Jerry picks up the phone and dials the number) I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?
The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
Yeah, that's a deal. That's a terrible deal. I don't want to go out to dinner with him. Id rather make my own suit.
Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do some TV spots for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store. That was Leapin' Larry himself, I'm gonna meet with him tomorrow.
But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.
What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?
(cont) and this whole justice league, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman. You mean to tell me Superman can't cover everything?
All right, fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone)
If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber.
Im just gonna get my jacket, Ill meet you downstairs. Whats the matter, did you call?
So tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?
...I got you an apartment in this building.
What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?
Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.
Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of lobster)
I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off.
(to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.
You were saying Stan? I-I'm sorry about that.
What do I say if he picks up?
Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?
The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
You never really had the right comeback, anyway.
Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.
But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.
You told me that already like two months ago.
No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.
All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.
I think I saw one a coupla doors down.
(tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggage, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangements, but we can't seem to be friends when we sleep together.
Yes. Hes a doctor. (Elaine starts to leave. ) Wait a second. (Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in Elaines purse.) (to George) What are you doing?
(calls) Hey you two. Im ready to go.
Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?
Well how did he react when you gave it to him?
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me.
(hits button) Come on up. (opens door a little)
No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing.
He was in the shop. I thought you told me he wasn't going to be there.
Hey, guess what. I just bought my father a Cadillac
Well, for one think, don't listen to him.
In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
Well, I got to talk her out of this.
(in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.
(hanging up the phone) Oh! There's my Chinese food, I gotta run. All you.
So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye.
(Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell smoke?
Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.
Hes a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.
Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
So I dont know what shes using it for.
Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.
His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I wouldve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. Hes so self-involved.
Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.
You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?
You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?
Doesnt think anyone can tell. So cmon, do we have a deal?
Hey, were kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?
(ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.
You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
Excuse me. (Gets up and answers the door.) Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!
(smugly, under-his-breath) Not only that, I broke his thumbs.
Ya what was this? (HE IMITATES MOHEL'S FLINCHING)
(in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine) So did you figure out Darryl's... you know.
Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both killed!
But you yada yada'd over the best part.
I gave you a taste. What do you want?
I'll see you later. (he leaves with unseemly haste)
You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West? Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.
I think thats the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!
Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
Fasten your seat belts. we're goin' to see the baby.
I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.
Hello. Oh! Hi George.......What! ..really! All right I'll call Elaine , we'll meet you down there.
Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.) You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?
(To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.
(Scoffing) Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.
You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?
But I don't know if this is gonna work.
I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. (Miss Rhode Island laughs.)
Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?
have some more, take some for the road.
Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.
So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!
I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!
You unwittingly made a major commitment. That's a lot of pressure.
Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
Honey, what'd you do with the can opener?
I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment for two days. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my parents. they'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own I'm sure it's gonna be some awful dump. Wait a second.. Have you checked in The Plaza yet?
But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.
... as long as one of them is not him.
You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.
Well, I brought them up there to take his records--
You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here. Mike Wichter. He sold plastic straws. You know the ones? You could bend them.
Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?
There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...
It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.
I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.
(a lightbulb goes on in his head) Riverside Drive.
Course you may not see it for twenty years.
I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?
What do you mean you're in the same class?
Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage.
Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?
Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough.
Im sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...
Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!
Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something.
Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.
They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!
I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.
Oh! Come om . He'll be over there for a half hour, he gets lost over there. C'mon so what is this about?
It's a movie stub from the 930 show. George, I think Willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes.
Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.
All right. (goes into his hallway and comes back) You got my fins?
I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave.
And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month!
No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch)
Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.
Do you know what this is all about? Do you know, why were here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about We should go out? This is what theyre talking about...this whole thing, were all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, were all out! There are people tryin to find us, they dont know where we are. (on an imaginary phone) Did you ring?, I cant find him. Where did he go? He didnt tell me where he was going. He must have gone out. You wanna go out you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...Then youre standing around, whatta you do? You go We gotta be getting back. Once youre out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, its my feeling, youve gotta go.
Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down. It's a business.
Coincidence? This guys in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment?
So then as I was getting out of the car, ...
Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.
Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 630 and gimme a call.
Really? How come you never pursued her before?
I mean it's a terrible mistake, I mean he thinks I ruined some deal of his at NBC, I don't know anything about any deal at NBC.
Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?
So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is better?
Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.
Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, Yeah, I got this new thing Platonic. My idea, my name, callin it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- dont do anything, and go right home. Whatd you think? I think its going to be big! I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didnt work. Yknow, I bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, Uh, Hi, uh my names Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, its a Riconic relationship.
All right, now you call it in the air.
At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.
I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.
You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.
"Hey, by the way, did you ever call that guy from the health club.?"
How do you know she's not my wife?
But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?
Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.
I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.
Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.
The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves)
Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me?
Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!
Uh, THANKS! This is FUN! Yeah, this turned out to be a GREAT weekend.
Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.
He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!
Wow. Kenny Rogers Roasters. Finally open. Hey, look at the size of that neon chicken on the roof.
Yeah. I want that coat. (Jerry opens his wallet, looking for the dry-cleaning ticket)
Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.
What's even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics.
Everyday is my birthday. (Sarcastically joking off what George said)
Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.
Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!
Well it's been quite a night I could sure use a cup of coffee.
Hold it, hold it...Look your gonna need the jaws of life to get out of those things.
(continuing unphased) You wanna get the other end, cause I wanna get it in the hall.
Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.
Oh, nothing happened, you know, but is was great.
So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on me.
Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts, so he killed him.
(Pointing) He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..
Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.
Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.
Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.
Well you can't take her maybe you can't take me either.
There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair, striped shirt?
To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.
You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!
(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?
But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?
Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?
(Interrupts) Excuse me...Excuse me... Are you asking him out ?
"Of course" was the last thing he said?
Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.
What the hell he's supposed to be on medication I don't understand he told me he's getting medication what happened to his medication!?
Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump over the net.
So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that...
All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.
Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him )
Great, you're lonely and miserable again. (presses button to call elevator)
(To cashier) I'd like to speak with the manager, please.
Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (Jerry smiles. George laughs.) So, how's the book coming? (George's laughs taper off...) I say, how's the book comin'?
I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.
Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it They're roommates. She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back. She's not gonna do that.
I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.
Oh, big fighting marlin. (Jerry acts like he is catching a marlin)
This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!
I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid...
There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts.
I'm going to the hospital to see Fulton. I'm not even saying hello, I'm going right into material.
Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?
You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?
Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.
Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?
That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.
But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?
Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What drives me to take chances like that?
Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.
I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes when someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within the gay community. They're probably discriminated against because of that, people say to them "Y'know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but I think think it's about time, y'know that you got in shape, tucked the shirt in and lost the wife". But if people are even going to assume that people that are neat are gay, maybe instead of doin' this, "Y'know I think Joe might be a little... [waves hand back and forth]", they should vacuum "Y'know I think Joe might be >vroom< [makes vacuuming motion]. Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little >vrooom<..."
Ill have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.
Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.
A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?
So you don't cry when your grandmother dies? But a hotdog makes you lose control?
I mean I'm happy sometimes, but-but not now.
Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's.
Hey you know George isn't to happy, ahh, about your new friendship.
I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.
well, you know, sometimes a square is everything
(weary) Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out?
Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.
My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you dont make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life.
and that's why you're going out with him
Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. (And to George) What do you mean you can't tell me?
I would like to propose a toast....Wait a second.. George! George Costanza come in here.
Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.
Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.
I cant think about it now. Come on, Im going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.
You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.
You dont have to say Wow. I know its Wow. (Kramer smiling) And theres that smile again. Well, what is that? (Intercom buzzes.) Its George.
Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.
All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura opens the door and gets out). What? What?
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.
I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you?
Okay, fine. (Jerry takes a coin from his pocket.) This is the official flip. No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and thats it. Agreed?
Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!
Yes. (To Jenny) You're sure there's nothing we can do?
Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is who's responsible for this?
I don't know  he's got some valuable antiques, He's worried they'll break something.
And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.
She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.
You told Testikov, (Elaine nods) that Tolstoy wanted to name his book "War-- What Is IT Good For?"?
You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.
He doesn't even care if a man answers.
to himself Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.
How can I ever have you over? Youll sit there moping.
Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?
It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.
One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub.
Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?
Look, youre a nice guy, its just that... we dont have anything in common.
Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!
It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---
Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?
Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.
Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes.
It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look (searches for word) stupid. (to salesman) I'm sorry.
You what? You passed? How could you do that?
Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your guy?
That's the last babka. They got the last babka.
What is this? What are we doing? What in god's name are we doing?
(Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So, the last person in should close the door!
Kramer!!! (Jerry points to the lamp post they are about to crash into)
I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.
Kramer, why do you have to (noticing Newman) Hello, Newman.
Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?
Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice?
Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.
(sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there and I will.
Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?
They guy's in my house right now. What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.
Fluff and Fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.
"Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old married couple--" *I told you that pear was washed*!
I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.
He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.
And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.
He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.
(To his parents) So? What do you think?
No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.
Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place.
Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.
Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason.
(Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.
Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.
Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.
So you just pretended it didnt bother you?
Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?
The dating world is not a fun world...its a pressure world, its a world of tension, its a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I dont know what they need. I know I dont have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one Im- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, were all human beings, what is the story? Ive never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, Ive never been in a situation, when I thought to myself I could use a cotton-ball right now. I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they dont need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, theyre like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? Theyre huge and two days later, theyre out, theyre gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin with them? The only time I ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, theres two or three, that look like theyve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I dont know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl whos left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I dont know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. Lets move on. The dating world is a world of pressure. Lets face it a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance youll end up naked at the end of it. You know? Well, Bill, the boss thinks youre the man for the position, why dont you strip down and meet some of the people youll be workin with?
Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?
Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?
What do you mean you don't think so?
(pointing at the operation he mouths the words) Did it go in?
And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?
I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply)
A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.
The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. Cause it says Waiting Room. Theres no chance of not waiting. Cause they call it the waiting room, theyre gonna use it. Theyve got it. Its all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and youve got your little magazine. You pretend youre reading it, but youre really looking at the other people. You know, youre thinking about about them. Things like, I wonder what hes got. As soon as she goes, Im getting her magazine. And then, they finally call you and its a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. Well, I guess Ive been chosen. Ill see you all later. You know, so you think youre going to see the doctor, but youre not, are you? No. Youre going into the next waiting room  the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You dont wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You dont want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in? Do they scalp tickets to these things? I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two...
Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there.
Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?
You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?
What do you think the worst part of being blind is?
They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.
Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this.
Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.
Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to fancy restaurants. (takes a sip of water)
Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! (Kramer gestures sympathetically) And who buries a bird?
Soon as I get off the phone wih you.
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.
(Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.
That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?
Yea. (pulls at the t-shirt) This is Golden Boy's son Baby Blue.
I was hoping you'd offer. (The intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
(on phone) Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act (pauses for response from Adrian) No new material (Elaine enters) He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week, it killed. (waves hello to Elaine; pauses for response from Adrian) Thank you, thanks fo.. you will not regret this. Ok, Bye. (hangs up phone; to Elaine) Hey.
Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something.
Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.
Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How many of those did we go to?
Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?
Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey!
(sarcastically) Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.
Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... (to himself, cursing her) Mulva!
All right, the whole elevator business, let me just explain-
He was down at the other end. So he yells out, "Ready, On your mark, Get set, " and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.
I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.
Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!
So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything?
Oh, no, uh, go ahead. You got a pen?
Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.
You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?
(impatient) Gone! (starts maniacally laughing) (briefly stops to point and explain) That bumper sticker.
You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.
I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?
(sound of gunfire) Pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, Pkeeew!
Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?
Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?
(indicates with his thumb) Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.
What do you think the dry-cleaners is your own personal closet!
Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...
You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.
I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.
So what your genitals are still lined up.
(still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?
(in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room) Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad, you look so different.
You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.
I was out in the snow last night.
So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought ... What a coincidence. We're just about to eat.
Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend.
It's okayit's just a hot dog, (still sobbing) everything is going to be okay.
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?
Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?
Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?
Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.
Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.
Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.
Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''. And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. "Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''.
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!
Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something.
I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!
No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I dont know her name.
Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!
I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?
Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.
Yours?....You know what I'll think I'll brush later.
Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to give it up.
I don't even know what you're talking about.
Well, I-I-I told my wife not to bring it.
Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye. (hangs up the phone; turns to Kramer) You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.
Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?
I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.
Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.
Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.
Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here. (pointing up and down at George)
(Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in.
Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.
I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.
(Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.
All right, so youre chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead.
(standing in the bathtub) Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.
Kramer's Andre, he's fooling around with these 976 numbers (Kramer walks out of the bedroom) hey I told you, I don't want you doing that on my phone
Fourteen years down the drain. (points and walks off -- to the bathroom)
Nah, I dont go for these non-refundable deals. I cant commit to a woman. Im not going to commit to an airline.
I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.
What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. "I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other people. You won't be around me. But you will be around." "Take care now." Did you ever say that to somebody? "Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now." "Take care. Take care." What does this mean? "Take off!" Isn't that what you really want to say? "Take off now."
I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!
Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?
"Just one....gotta go back.....Oh but get this. Elaine, you will appreciate this. I'm sitting in Tim Whatley's waiting room...He's got a Penthouse right out on the table."
(smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good.
You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, whats going on?
There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.
So you have no control over the remote?
I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .
I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)
Right in front of me!. How do you know we're not together. Two guys, sittin' laughin' drinking Champagne Coolies.
(to Kramer and Morty) What is this about?
I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are gonna be so sorry!
(to George) That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.
What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?
Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
No. The police have no leads (sitting on the couch arm) and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.
You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
I think he's the same age as the father.
No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.
The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.
No, let's just do it. (Fire alarm goes off) What? What is going on? What is that about?
Yes it is. I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior.
(after the guy) You think you're better than me?
She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?
Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease?
No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.
She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.
Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!
Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum.
More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.
Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? There's no grace period.
No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald cure.
I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.
We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.
Listen, uh I just remembered... Im... uh, getting a facial.
You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.
Oh my eh, my Aunt's name is Mulva. She's-she's a masseuse.
No, but ah, seen any good movies lately?
God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?
And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.
We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! Well be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life.
Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! (runs back to his seat) Bad lighting on the porch.
Ohhh... You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.
He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, that were manufactured in Korea.
(arriving at apartment, sees Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from Kramer's) So you live right... there.
No he's going downtown to guard the suit.
Good luck, It's sold out for the next three weeks.
Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there by two o'clock. We should take a cab.
(still watching tv; sounds like basketball) Bottle-wipe supercedes it.
Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?
That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.
I asked. Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian football.
Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.
You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.
Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!
(smiling) Really? That's great. You said that to him?
I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal?
It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?
A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?
Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman anything you say she does!
Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.
He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.
So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you.
Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.
Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.
Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?
No, It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago . she's trying to become an actress.
Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..
Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.
So, where do you want to eat tonight?
Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.
And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now.
[not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]
Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?
Have you thought any more about that trip?
Well, Ill tell you what. Ill choose you for it. Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...thats it, you gotta win three.
So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else in real estate?
well aside from that from that, how did he like the sandwiches?
I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'
Hey Seth. Man it is coming down hard out there.
Yeah, I think it is. (They walk toward the man. Jerry hesitates.) Wheres Elaine?
(eating pop corn) hmm I love this artificial flavoring I like it better than butter I think it's more consistent
Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!
You know, the water pressures terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower.
You did not tell me not to sell.
What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!
(to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?
Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?
Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits on a couch.) Hey, what about this one?
(unenthusiastic) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) Im just, Im really glad youre here.
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer, say it isn't so.
Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.
Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime.
You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. (with a British accent) "Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you".
This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...
(starts pulling them apart) Alright break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells)
So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.
Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later.
Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.
This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.
I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...
I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.
How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!
So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?
oh.. uh.. you know your breath is a little garlicky you better take some gum.
Kramer, they're fumigating. There's toxic gas in there.
I dont return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.
No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. Whats important is you two getting back together. Eh, then well talk about the car.
Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day.
A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?
This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.
Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" or, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" You emphasize "Jerry" or "bring."
My car? You drove it into the swamp!
No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.
Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!
Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired.
Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. Im sure theyd just as soon give it to you, but youd have to come up with that money.
Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.
Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?
What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha ha!
Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met!
Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.
(tucking in his shirt) Oh ya this is Rachel.
Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.
How can I want it now, if you want it?
Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents.
Who wouldn't like him? I like him. And I'm a guy.
Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.
Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. He's a punk, a patsy, a hack.
Oh, no, no, no, wait a second, wait a second th-th-that--
(Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.
How could she not tell me where she was staying?
The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.
Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything.
No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?
Hey, hey, what are you doing, that?s my quarter.
The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.
So, how did you get up there? Did you say you had to use the bathroom?
So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.
It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.
(scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.
It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.
I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.
Uh, again? (Limping towards the door) I'll be right there.
I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.
'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off the table.
Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.
Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!
Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin?
She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.
Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh, Ketchup? Pretty name for a girl.
Uh, this is George. (reaches for her name) Im sorry...
What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.
Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer, sitting on his lawn chair with a sparkler)
Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.
Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.
Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that?
So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?
Golden Boys always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry. Here... touch Golden Boy!
No, gore-tex. It's new. (Checks his pockets.) Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that.
I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you.
Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!
Your breath is fine. It's delightful, it's delicious.
Actually it's being taken care of right now.
Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money..
(Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.
Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of?
More Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I don't even have any wood in the house!
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so fuck(bleeped)ing good.
What are you gonna do about the roommate?
You know, Kramer's gonna clean up on this place.
Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.
(nodding awkwardly for a moment) All right, I think we're done here. (Jerry leaves and Phil shuts the door darkly)
Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.
Franco's no good? ...They got no team leaders.
Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over my side.
Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!
Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.
See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'.
Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.
No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls.
Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!
Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?
Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.
Well, well, why are you getting rid of your refrigerator? (he gets up from the table and carries a dish into the kitchen)
Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line.
We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men.
Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat...
(yelling) Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.
Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one.
I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?
(pointing to Kramer's hair) You got some suds over here.
If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.
Hey, ??? is rerunning the Yankee game. You watching this?
Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!
I don't know, this? (Shows his neck to Sara.)
Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour, then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night.
Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!
You know my parents are coming in and I got some clean up to do , so if you and Potsie are done scheming....
I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.
(nudging George) Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.
Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in.
We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.
The female orgasm is kinda like the bat cave, very few people know where it is and if you're lucky enough to see it you probably don't know how you got there and you can't find your way back after you left. There are two types of female orgasms, the real and the fake. And uh I'll tell you right now, as a man, we don't know. We do not know, because to a man sex is like a car accident and determining the female orgasm is like being asked 'What did you see after the car went out of control?'. 'Uh I heard a lot of screeching sounds, uh I remember I was facing the wrong way at one point. And in the end my body was thrown clear.'
So write a letter.. move to another...move to Staten Island., 'lot easier to blend in a sea of people in Staten Island than China believe me.
I live in New York. (slams the cab door) What the hell happened?
Over here. You can see right through here.
Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down. (To Elaine) What?
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?
I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone.
Pull yourself together. Your going in there soldier! That's an order!
Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
I suppose if it was on the protg's way to the mentor, they might.
Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the etiquette?
You what?! Get out! (pushes Kramer) Ten thousand?
I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?
There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.
All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter)
Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want? You're not a part of society.
To a guy you've never met? (mild sarcasm) Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous.
I don't understand why we have to eat now.
Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.
That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.
Yeah have a couple of pieces, weak, weak gum yeah
Youre already moping! Would you take the place?
So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth? (Elaine laughs silently)
(writing) Here's my address and number. And really, thanks again.
No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.
Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!
Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife fight for a citrus drink.
I don't think so. Why would I do that?
Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I'm sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.
I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out.
Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about it!
We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.
Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing "no") A little taste! (still shaking) Come on. (still shaking)
Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?
Would you excuse me a minute? Im gonna go to the bathroom. Ill be right back.
I dont get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?
Oh, I get it, this is about the button.
I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example.
Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.
I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping.
Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, "Photographs - Do not bend".
How much did you wound up tipping her?
(Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! A dinosaur!
Let me in, it's me. (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the dressing room) Here. You don't know what this is costing me. (hands Kramer the ticket)
(Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My, isn't this an awkward moment?
All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.
I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?
So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?
Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go?
Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?
You can't go to China What about your job?
Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)
"The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour". I'm confused.
Yeah, Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would you describe Kramer's hair?
What could possess anyone to throw a party? I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.
I just wanted to say how sorry I was...
(C0NT'D) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.
Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...
Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone)
Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.
Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.
This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.
I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine!
Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.)
Okay, you tell me. What is it worth?
So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right?
(defensive) At least it was just the handle!
Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.
It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.
Ill have the, ah, turkey club without the bacon.
That's enough. (They leave. George comes around the corner.)
Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.
(picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt off?
Super bowl! Hey, an original G.I. Joe. (picks up both items) With a full frogman suit.
Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday?
Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him.
Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?
You know it and I ditched all my junk food.
I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.
Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?
Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention, Elaine laughs) Maybe it's time you got a different hobby.
Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
"I dunno how you could forget . He kept reffering to himself in the third person. "Jimmy's under the boards. Jimmy's in the open. Jimmy makes the shot."
Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...
Hey buddy. I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's like in there, all night long things are creaking and cracking. And that red light is burning my brain!
Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)
I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?
First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.
No,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.
I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.
Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)
It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes the door) Give me that back.
I mean, she called me. I havent called her. She started it.
You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em.
Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.
Yes. I do. You show me where there's a can opener in that drawer. (Answers the phone.) Hello! I'm sorry, I'm just fighting with my wife.
Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this uh considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check?
Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.
(walking out) Thanks for having me over, guys.
Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.
In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?
Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's leftovers.
Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you.
Here he is... that's the guy! (rolls up window) No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!
Oh! Come on, you told them you're from out-of-town just so you could stay in a hotel room.
Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately.
Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.
Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.
She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.
[quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!
Get in the car! Get in the car!
Are saying you're banning me from the store?
She went out to get her head shaved.
(for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.
Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.
Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.
(tapping the spatula while waiting for waffles to be done) Any second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready.
I think if ones going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. Its common courtesy. I dont know. Thats just the way I was brought up.
Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?
(Opens the door) C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? (Starts jiggling his keys - as if he's calling out for a dog) Huh? C'mon! C'mon!
Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.
What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?
He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?!
Theres one thing I dont understand. Why does it please you? (to the phone) George Costanza, please.
I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.
Alright, then just get rid of it. You wont have any problem.
20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.
And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.
Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.
Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.
All right, go, it's a race! Come on!
It's been three days already, forget about Lupe.
How long did you leave it up there?
So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more "grease monkey".
What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.
Well I, I can't believe this. I know Phil, he, he's a good friend of mine. We play softball together. How could this be?
(Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) I didn't say anything.
Yes, I know youre not gonna do it. Thats why I bet.
Who do you know? He knows my hair.
Ma, you cant look up words in the dictionary! (to Morty) Dad, shes cheating!
Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!
Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the lunch with me?
(incredulous) You asked her to move in with you?
Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number.
He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them
Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they want
What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
(Excited) I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!
If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.
George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.
Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. You had to give him a box of cigars.
Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer!
A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.
So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.
Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.
Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!
(Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.
You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-
Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!
George what the hell are you doing over there? I told you to mind your own business now stay out of my affairs!
Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane enters)
Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?
and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!
You're not qualified to work at the catalog.
All right, that's not bad. Now get over here!
No, go ahead, I second-hand smoke two packs a day.
They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?
C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.
So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?
Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.
Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.
Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?
(to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? (wondering what the hell's Kramer doing)
Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!
So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?
Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio.
Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
(holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the fridge?
You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. And you can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. Then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin' Alright, gimme everything you have, too''.
Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.
I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, its very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, Call the police. You really should call the police. So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, Yeah, Im calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... Im gonna see some real action. Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out The Report. They give you Your Copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I dont really think were gonna crack this case, do you? Its not like Batman, where theres three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up, hes dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him, hes a PENGUIN!
Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.
Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show.
All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.
They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.
Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives. (Picks up phone and dials) Hello Tim? Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you? Well it turns out I can use them. Oh, you do? I understand. Okay. Bye. He already made plans, he can't change them.
Plus Im wearing short sleeves, I dont want to expose my tattoos. (Vanessa smiles; thinking) Shes unbelievable!
And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table)
(annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? Besides it's not a submarine and there's no room for a periscope in a car.
(quiet) Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..
Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened. (listens) Well, I think you should. Okay, bye.
If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.
Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!
Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--
I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody up.
(to George) You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.
We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.
Can't you at least die with a little dignity?
You should always carry a pad and pen.
Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!
The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.
It's this one here in the back. (Tilts his head back, and knocks Elaine's trophy out the window. A loud hissing sound and commotion is heard from the street below. Everyone runs to the windows to look.)
I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
(to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?
Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little longer)
(Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?
(startled - eyes wide open) Hello, is somebody there? (scurrying sound) Mr.- Mr. Marbles?
Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.
You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!
You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?
When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.
Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there?
George, we're trying to have a civilization here.
Ya sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? (Meryl laughs. The owner of the coffee shop comes over.)
Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a men's room. That's the end of that.
(Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.
Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do?
(in a hurry) Yea you're leaving at three o'clock.
Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?
Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it?
Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.
So are you gonna get him a chair?
