I know, I just can't bring myself to do it meanwhile that freezer keeps getting smaller and smaller (she smiles) (Elaine looks at her watch) oh, don't wanna keep Tony waiting
Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.
Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that canvas?
Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad it's Klompus.
...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry.
Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.
Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.
Im getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other line beeps) Im getting another call, see ya(answers call) Hello!
No, no, no, another race - out of the question.
The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal.
No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him.
They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.
Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.
Oh, heh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.
Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago.
Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.
So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything.
Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews.
I got a date with that girl, Lena.
Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!
When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers.
Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
I don't care, why are you telling me this?
O.K. from now on I want you to call me "Jerry the Great".
Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it.
No, it&Mac226;s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i...
Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..
Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guys out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, its true, men hear a drill, its like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, Honey, I think Jims working on something over there. So they run over to the guy. Now they dont actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. Thats what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, What are you using, a Phillips-head? You know, we feel involved. Thats why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, thats just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they dont cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, thatll hold.
Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.
I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there.
(indicating the woman) Game, set and match, huh Milos?
No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.
Hey, lll just keep swimming. Hey, hey. Im not done. I know what you're up to Ramon. Because Im a member here, this is my place to swim.
Schumann. (George stops himself, frightened. Jerry looks around the lobby.) Where are they?
(Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here?
I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.
But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.
Yeah, I took her home one night  we kinda started up a little bit in the car.
She'll have a cup of coffee and a broiled chicken.
So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?
Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men
You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!
Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.
Same as you cant overwet. You see, once something is wet, its wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die youre dead, right? Lets say you drop dead and I shoot you. Youre not gonna die again, youre already dead. You cant overdie, you cant overdry.
This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-
Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.
Although what if its one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?
(Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there.
Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him.
What do you think it could've been just some dude?
That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?
Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?
Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...
Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet.
'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?
Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!
Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.
Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.
Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.
You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... (he spots a mailman crouched emptying a box) Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.
That's what a gym teacher once told me.
Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?
Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.
Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen "Girlie" Brown would be very proud of you.
Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again.
What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?
I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.
There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.
Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.
I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!
Well what am I going to tell Alex?
All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?
Yours?....You know what I'll think I'll brush later.
George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments.
Hey, it's one thing if I asked you "Could you do me a favor?" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE (Obviously up to something. Jerry doesn't suspect anything - yet) Whey you told me what you went through on the plane, it makes you stop and think. You appreciate having a real friend.
No appointments at all? (motions to Elaine to move over)
(seeing Fredo's tombstone) Oh, my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up! (hands the shovel to Kramer)
Well, I am sure I had a good reason.
(Stunned) No, keep it. (Elaine enters the apartment) Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.
Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.
how can u say things like that over the phone?
You do of course try on, when you buy?
"So what about the Penthouse. Did you ask him?"
Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.
That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The Mohel circumcised my finger!
Well my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.
Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police! Some guy just gave me a wise answer. Ask that woman.
Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..
Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day.
Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.
You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.
Well, well, why are you getting rid of your refrigerator? (he gets up from the table and carries a dish into the kitchen)
I tell ya, I don't see it happening.
So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head.
(Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?
Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?
What do you say to a person like you?
Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... (to himself, cursing her) Mulva!
Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, "This is good, who is this? I like this person". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, (pretending to wake up) "Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!"
Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to fancy restaurants. (takes a sip of water)
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.
Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure there are many people who do not like me.
I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Yknow Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, shes probably screamin at those aliens, I gotta have a lo mein!
Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
No!!! The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him, you break his spirit!
What are you all out of breath from?
But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.
What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?
And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.
No, no. Its not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, its not like Marlenes a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, weve had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling. (George nods.) And its these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if Im busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and shes in the middle of a sentence!
Uh-huh, yeah. (Smiling, nodding, clearly wanting Bryant to shut up)
The wheels are in motion, things are happening!
Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?
Its a list of excuses, its for that guy, Horneck, whos at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I dont have to see him. (Elaine laughs.) I need it. (Elaine starts writing on the list.) What are you doing?
I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody up.
You dont have to say Wow. I know its Wow. (Kramer smiling) And theres that smile again. Well, what is that? (Intercom buzzes.) Its George.
Kramer!!! (Jerry points to the lamp post they are about to crash into)
One of the problems in life is that when youre a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, I got the front seat I wanted the front seat! I called it. And the other kid knows hes got nothing to say He called it. What can I do? If there was a Kid Court Of Law, it holds up. Your Honour, my client did ask for the front seat And the judge would go, Did he call it? Well no, he didnt call- BANG! (Jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled.
Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.
Why dont you ask that doctor what it is?
(To Nina) Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy, huh?
Alright Kramer, enough of this. Let's go find George.
So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right?
No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, hes treatin me just like a regular customer, now!
Well I think I get the gist of it.
Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.
Ya sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? (Meryl laughs. The owner of the coffee shop comes over.)
Its very good cantaloupe. (Kramer leaves; to George) So thats it? Youre out?
I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping.
As a guy I dont know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I dont know how to say, Bill, I feel I need to see other men. Do you know what I mean? Theres nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think thats the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because theyre two guys. Thats almost all we need to have in common. Cause sports  sports and women  is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, So, whats in the refrigerator?
Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.
why don't you just break it off with her. tell her it's over
Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?
She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.
Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby.
To wash my hands. Theyre sticky from the orange.
George, this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on. (Jerry leaves.)
You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.
Pretty good. I think she might be the one.
Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time.
I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!
You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.
I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting.
It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook?
Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?
No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.
What happened to you? You were going like a hundred miles an hour.
(Joking around) Hey, didn't I beat you up in the fourth grade?
What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?
Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.
Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department.
Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..
(Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do?
I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.
What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--
Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
What, theres something wrong with Loni Anderson? (pause) Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it.
Im worried I wont be able to talk to him. Hes such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.
(a la "Don Corleone") Never go against the family, Elaine.
An old friend of mine, whom you may have met, George Costanza, has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formally a highly placed official with an outfit known as the IRS. And as we speak, at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information. And she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise.
All right Ramon, Im going to get going.
Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?
You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.
A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.
Yeah! I got it . It's in the apartment, but we can't go in there it's being fumigated.
(Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.
He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.
Naw, I gotta wait until its just the right time.
You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.
No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.
Come in for two minutes and sit with me.
Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little longer)
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.
(holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman anything you say she does!
Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?
I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.
Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!
(looks round) Don't worry, I'll get you out.
(on the phone) Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Ya. Oh, really? Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye. (hangs up the phone) Well, the yogurt verdict is in. (Kramer looks at Jerry with his arms out) Fat!
You don't even know what a write off is.
[quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!
Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.
Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned it...
Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women.
So I finally get to meet your pal Joey.
Cops eating Milanos. What crazy town is this?
Yeah, I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her.
Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent. It's very boring.
And that waist cincher, that was the topper!
My whole night's ruined. I didn't do any sets, didn't do any movies...
. . . All right (gritting teeth) Just give me the ticket.
Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line.
Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.
So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.
You know why? Because people like to say "salsa." "Excuse me, do you have salsa?" "We need more salsa." "Where is the salsa? No salsa?"
(hitting metal with the first strike of the shovel) Well, that was easy.
Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!
Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.
(sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there and I will.
Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.
I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care
Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, Im in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants.
Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.
Listen, Joel. Theres something I have to tell you...
Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.
(leaving the room) I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much.
Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.
Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I would've asked her.
Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife fight for a citrus drink.
It's not that bright orange one is it?
Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.
Why, what's wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders)
Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.
Oh yeah, well why don?t you Just get lost.
No Elaine he's normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York.
Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --
I said yes, but I don't feel right about it. I mean I hardly know the guy. That's a big step oin a relationship. The biggest. That's like going all the way.
What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, whats going on?
Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)
Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...
How about we leave and, come back in a week?
No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.
So are you gonna get him a chair?
So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.
You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.
That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother.
I don't have to be funny, I don't care.
Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?
So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?
I said I couldnt believe you liked that commercial. So what?
How come you're eating your peas one at a time?
Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.
You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!
Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there.
Yeah, well I don't trust this guy. I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.
Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her!
Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer enters)
You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars.
I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that? (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying)
...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the patient!
Hey look at this. What is going on here?
But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?
Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.
(to the phone) Hello yeah yes it is really ah, ah Could you hold on a second? (to George and Kramer) Hey listen to this, some woman found an electronic organizer, my name was in it, she wants me to help her track down the owner.
He never heard of corduroy! True story, true story.
(taking the envelope) Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em.
No you can't. (hangs up the phone) Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?
Shes limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.
Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! (runs back to his seat) Bad lighting on the porch.
Can't you at least die with a little dignity?
OK ... (nodding his head up and down) This is it cha know
I don't even know if I remember the number.
I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y. (he spits it into the waste bin)
Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?
No ,no I don't, I mean, Don't be silly..
That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I got.
OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers?
If I told you, you woulda given it away.
You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
It's like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action.
(reaching into his pocket) Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for it.
I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.
Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry pushes his door against Kramer's entrance]
Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.
Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie.
Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.
George, here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred!
(In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so.
I got it! (snaps his fingers) We give the keys to Elaine.
Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. (Hands over Kramer's quilt.)
Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?
And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.
Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those orange cones you have on the throughway... (Sees pilot) on the way... up here... um... I..
She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing.
I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the "It's me" on the phone today.
Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business thing...
You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.
I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' (mimes throwing) 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?
Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!
I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you?
Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. Youve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?
(Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in.
Of course she doesnt have five thousand dollars!
But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.
You what?! Get out! (pushes Kramer) Ten thousand?
You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. (Phone rings, he answers it) Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend.
Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. (holds his nose up like a pig) You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.
Well, you know; not everything. I do what I can.
Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.
So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.
We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.
Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar.
Yeah!.. Thanks.Oh! my god you saved my life.
It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
Yeah, hes nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper up to Jerry.) I know, I know. Its down again.
(adamant) No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back.
A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guys got a coma going like this  you dont want to mess with it.
Why can't I buy my father a car?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.
Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.
Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
So what does he care if you put lifts in?
Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in your friend John Germaine's band there.
I'm laying down! Then we'll see how he does up there, without all the assistance.
Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.
Well, that's it! Tonight's the night. I'm getting one. No "if and's or but's".
Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.
Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.
What do you mean? They know we're here.
Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.
Yes, but lets just stop it right there.
I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.
What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?
Let me explain something to you. You see, youre not normal. Youre a great guy, I love you, but youre a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldnt understand.
Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you.
No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald cure.
See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.
(acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?
Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.
Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business.
No, nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table)
Hey, not bad. (pointing to crest) I kinda like this little thing here.
First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.
Y-You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set!
Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?
I've been waiting a while for this. You know it's a shame Tony got all banged up, we're not gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?
I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce you get impeached and you're not even the president!
Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.
(leaving; singing) She'll be coming around the mountain...
George- What?! Youre kidding... Well, whats wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, Ill speak to you later. (He hangs up.) Wilkinson, the guy whos supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, hes in the hospital.
I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.
Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.
How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable special . I 've never gotten a cable special.....well that's it I'm not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado. (to the silent Kramer on the couch beside him) ...Exactly.
(Threatening tone) So, listen, Puddy. When we first started this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you want to play hard ball, I got my friend, George, here, and he can play pretty hard ball. (Leaving the negotiation to George) George, vein it up.
Ah, don't worry. I made reser... (catches himself)
So how did you leave it with him?
Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll uh try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. (Goes into his room, and comes back out with the jacket on.) Ahh, haven't worn this one in a long time.
Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!
I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You know (does the motion for the check) Check, Check. Unless the waiter isn't too shape then you gotta total it up. Sometimes they come over, "Do you want the check?" No I wanna be pen pals, can't you see what I'm doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people.
Yeah, yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. Would you mind. I'd like to take the picture back.
The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.
Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.
Kramer you're going to have to face her some time
(TO KRAMER, REBOX) Will you let me help you with that?
That?s what I?ll do, I?ll just call him and tell him, I?ll tell him. That?s all I?ll do. He's a human being, I?ll talk to him. He'll understand. Right?
Hey...I'm not stupid. I'm looking in that drawer, there's no can opener.
Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)
Actually, yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!
Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?
you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?
Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.
They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.
I guess they leave that up to the general population.
No, George was there, he said he had a great time.
I know. He got the hit in game SIX. So, so then what happened?
What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!
We'll see about that. (Runs to the window and shouts up to Kramer, who's on the roof.) Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win!
What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?
I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man.
Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye.
Let's get outta here. [to Buckles] I'll see ya.
It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.
He might want a show about anything and everything.
Where did I take it? Where Did I Take It? (stabbing a knife into a cutting board) Umm, to that place on, uh Columbus and 85th. Okay?
Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other line. Just a second.
Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.
Keep following him Kramer. don't let me down.
Newman . Open the door, Newman, I know you're in there.
You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!
Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?
I never shouldve gotten involved in this. Im a nervous wreck. Im not cut out for investing.
Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?'
Doesnt matter. Whats the young mans name? I would like to meet him.
See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! Then come out with the regular!
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?
Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.
So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that...
Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.
I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.
SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?
So I guess , you're not getting married?
Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog strangler. (George leans close) would you suck a mint or something. Can I come right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where we are. Where are we?
(apologetically) Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.
Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.
...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to.
Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.
Who figures and immigrants gonna have a pony?
Of course he did ..The guy's working ya.
Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, "Photographs - Do not bend".
Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?
(continuing) The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.
What are you so worried about this for?
It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.
(grabbing the list from Kramer) You're not getting any plantains.
You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?
You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.
Well, the mans an individualist  he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what hes doing.
My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.
No he's going downtown to guard the suit.
All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?
The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.
So Whatley sayd to me, "Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic."
Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.
Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.
But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.
have some more, take some for the road.
So, I guess you dont find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?
Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we play one for all the marbles?
And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.
But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there, "Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin. Well I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on."
Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.
Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.
If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.
Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?
Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.
I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.
Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery.
Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.
So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?
Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.
I didnt know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrants going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesnt make sense. Am I wrong?
Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.
(to Morty) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street!
How'd you expect to get out of here?
Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine?
What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back.
So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?
Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.
Dirt? That's alright, (for Jenna's benefit) because there's nothing wrong with dirt.
Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.
Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.
Oh! There coming to town tomorrow by the way.
So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City. I'm performing at Bally's.
You know, I really need to use the bathroom.
Hey, I thought you went to the game.
Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses.
He went to get some steak sauce. Why?
I hear you're going out with David Putty.
Actually, we met in the gym locker room.
What is that? (Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.)
No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'
I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.
(a lightbulb goes on in his head) Riverside Drive.
All right Newman, one more peep outta you, you're out of the whole operation!
So you have no control over the remote?
Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.
So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.
Go look at your face in the mirror.
Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.)
Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you.
I will, I just walked in the door.
Yeah, Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would you describe Kramer's hair?
(to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?
(Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine?
I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket)
Who would order a license plate that says "Assman"?
How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? Wha, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just sit there going, "Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh, no, another headcase!"
Oh, Im sorry. Im just waiting for someone.
(in a hurry) Ya how you gonna get all this done in time?
(Picks one up) Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?
So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?
I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.
Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up.
Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
(answering machine) leave a message and I?ll call you back, thanks. JOE DIVOLA Jerry, Joe Divola. *Pbt* *Pbt* *Pbt* I have a hair on my tongue, I can't get it off, you know how much I hate that? Course you do, you put it there. I know what you said about me Seinfeld. I know you badmouthed me to the execs at NBC, put the kibosh on my deal. Now I?m gonna put the kibosh on you. You know I?ve kiboshed before, and I will kibosh again.
Thats not too bad. Its not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.
And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now.
I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
(removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?
Oh my god, he knows. (Jerry and Gino scrambling) Go. (yelling to the door) One second.
Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets.
Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.
You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're lifting heavy suit cases.
George? (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.
Im meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.
Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?
Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?
But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.
George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.
A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little decision.
Now, I should tell you that, at this point, she's under the impression that youre - a - ah
(Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them!
This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.
All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.
I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.
Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs phone up)
wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to just sense it's in front of the couch?
You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.
Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal right now. (covers Jean-Paul with a blanket)
So what do you have to say for yourself?
(thinking) Thank you, Pamela! (turns to talk to Vanessa; to Vanessa) So, youre a lawyer...
I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...
Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place.
Alright! (picks up the phone and dials) Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. You know, you got a great 'John Houseman' name. Alec Berg. Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg?
I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?
(to Kramer) ...( words missing)...laugh , everything's nice and at the end of the night I go for a little contact. I get the PULL BACK. This woman said the filthiest things I've ever heard in my life. I get the Pull Back.
I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.
Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.
Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.
(to the phone) Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you- Oh, Hi. Joel... Oh, you just came in... Listen, I cant make it to the game tonight... I, uh, have to tutor my nephew... Yeah, hes got an exam tomorrow... Geometry... You know, trapezoids, rhombus... Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. Theyre at the Will-Call window... And Im really sorry... Have a good time... Well talk next week... Okay... Yeah, I dont... Fine.. Fine... Bye.
(to George) Hey, there's Pat. (calls) Hey, Pat.
Oh, no, uh, go ahead. You got a pen?
(Chuckles) You don't know the half of it.
Evry-Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. "Oh, is he good?" "Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best." They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, "You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. No, he's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher." And then there's always that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me." Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, "Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. And everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."
But then we would have missed the whole thing.
Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again? (listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone. C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me. (hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello.
(Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.
Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they want
What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?
Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I?
I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.
Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.
Well you should hear the message from my nut. Where's George and Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, I feel very vulnerable.
Oh, well here. Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it again.
No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.
We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.
There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.
Im Dan. Can I have my list back, please?
Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!
Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.
Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?
Well you said they could come and take the records.
Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude.
(Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.
Yeah, thats good. Hed clunk our heads together like Moe.
I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this?
(nodding awkwardly for a moment) All right, I think we're done here. (Jerry leaves and Phil shuts the door darkly)
(still watching tv; sounds like basketball) Bottle-wipe supercedes it.
Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye. (hangs up the phone; turns to Kramer) You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.
You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.
(to George) Is that uh, other apartment still available?
No, its, its just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it. (Jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) Ten-fifteen... No, dont be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, its no trouble at all... Ill see you tomorrow... Great, bye. (He hangs up the phone; to Kessler) I dont believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here!
He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.
(Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
(Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?
I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum.
You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.
Well, I have some money. What do you need? (pulls out some bills)
I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.
But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.
Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?
Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa.
So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!
I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.
Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?
Toilet brush, oh (he pulls a 'Damn, shoulda guessed!' face). Alright, I can replace that.
(wiping his brow) He could use a couple laughs.
(after the guy) You think you're better than me?
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.
Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!
(picks it up) I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table.
You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.
Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.
Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a men's room. That's the end of that.
All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.
Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.
It's Kramer isn't it? I knew it!  The greasy door knob the constant licking of the fingers, he's hooked to the chicken isn't he?
So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.
It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .
He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.
Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?
You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em.
Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...
So you were with him that day at the track?
You cannot buy half a can of soda.
I don't know, but you look like you're happy.
Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?
(to the Drake) Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. (To Elaine) Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?
(Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.
Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one.
Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!
I noticed she's big on the phrase "yada yada."
(thinking; quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
(Trying to block out Kramer, he starts to sing along with the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus..
That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
Right in front of me!. How do you know we're not together. Two guys, sittin' laughin' drinking Champagne Coolies.
Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the lunch with me?
But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!
(into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!
You're pretty comfortable up there eh, Bubble boy?
(disbelief) So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?!
Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,
Why didn't you come up with your own?
You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.
... I just got a postcard from Elaine?
Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear?
Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.
And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.
Well you can't take her maybe you can't take me either.
So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. Its a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and Im supposed to feel bad. Is that the way its supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldnt you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. Cause its not easy to give someone the toe, youve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... (Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) Look at that toe, buddy. (He puts his foot down.) I mean, thats really insulting to get the toe, isnt it?
You can't put a paper towel on his head.
(To Guard) I just wanted you to scare him.
What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't respect salad eaters.
(on the phone) Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye. (hangs up the phone)
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??... Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women!
. Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it
He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it.
I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers.
Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him )
Let me have a look at this thing.
And who were you tryin to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?
"Hey, by the way, did you ever call that guy from the health club.?"
C'mon up. (To George) Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'
No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.
Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes.
You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.
No, I kinda tried to test his hearing.
Wow! Hey, theres Clare. I better go down.
(hanging up the phone) Oh! There's my Chinese food, I gotta run. All you.
I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.
I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.
Hey, look, there's Bobby Eighteen?s father-in-law, Mr Reichman. George and I were just talking about that today, I can?t believe it! That?s the guy who threw George out of the wedding.
I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going "I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?
You like the couch? Ill tell you what Im gonna do.
No, gore-tex. It's new. (Checks his pockets.) Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that.
I think the thing I admire most about the Chinese is that they're hanging in there with the chopsticks. Because, if you think about it, you know, they've seen the fork... by now. I'm sure they've seen the spoon, they're going, "Yeah, yeah, they're OK... We're going to stay with the sticks." I mean, I don't know how they've missed it, thousands of years ago, Chinese farmer gets up, has his breakfast with the chopsticks, goes out and works all day in the field with a shovel... Hello?... Shovel! Not going out there ploughing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues.
The % thing to do is just not think about it.
(throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?
In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?
You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.
Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one.
Did you say, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show" or, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"? (Elaine comes over.)
(getting looks from his parents) Not you. Older people.
No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car.
Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.
Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land.
This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you dont have to be home on time.
The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too.
The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.
Well, what's going on? What is this thing?
Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered? (Sees the pac) What happened?
I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away)
It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes the door) Give me that back.
(Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?
Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
So you just did the opposite of everything?
Expecting Newman? That's funny because I just happened upon him down at the Kenny Roger's Roasters.
What is this? What are we doing? What in god's name are we doing?
Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.
You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry?
He was down at the other end. So he yells out, "Ready, On your mark, Get set, " and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.
Elaine? What does she have to - (notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.) Oh no...
Uh, how about a couple of people like us.
(Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.
Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drakes coffee cake
He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught.
Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.
Yeahhh, am I imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and holds it up to Willie) Found this little cutie in the pocket. (throws the stub on the counter)
Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.
On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?
Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...
Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.
That was brutal. I cant go back out there.
Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?
I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.
You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.
He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes.
Well, I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble.
Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model.
Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?
You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."
Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do?
(singing) Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home.
Oh, I cant. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly.
Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?
It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.
Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.
Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?
No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!
It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---
Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--
They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.
Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.
He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home.
She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.
A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?
I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.
well aside from that from that, how did he like the sandwiches?
I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... (Jerry stops, and mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica on the phone at work.)
Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.
Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.
All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.
I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation.
I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!
(Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.
Could you make a little more noise? (To his parents) Listen, I'm gonna have to call you later.
If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. Hes always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess its because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.
Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. (Holds lettuce head) Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts the intellect, represented here (Pulls off tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large piece) Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats tiny piece of lettuce)
Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the verge of this big promotion?
I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?
I don't know. Who could've been in my apartment.
No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?
Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.
Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?
No, I actually find you quite charming. A bit verbose at times...
No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.
I kinda like this opera crowd, I feel tough... Anybody else got a problem?
They sealed him up with the mint inside.
Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.
Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10?
'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.
C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one.
Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.
I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.
Well its not like it's a really funny story or anything.
I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.
Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.
This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!
(To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. (Gestures to a black Saab)
I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.
I like that. (He opens the closet. Elaine walks out with an angry look.) What do you think, George?
I mean it's a terrible mistake, I mean he thinks I ruined some deal of his at NBC, I don't know anything about any deal at NBC.
Get a march goin'! March it! (She exits)
So, can you believe that message? Now I?ve got to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply)
I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.
No no come on really, get another one. Itll take a second.
Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.
....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant? Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it in there by helicopter, you know keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. "We got the hair but I think we lost the Zest." ....rejects the transplant with organs. Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . Guy just standin' there and suddenly... ..Bink! ( motions hair flying out of his head)........lands in someone's frozen yogurt.
(opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.
Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?
Look I really don't know what they're plans are.
What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says " Aw, I'll just have some coffee." There's no truth to that.
So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner?
(Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here..
(Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together?
A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.
I'll pick you up at your apartment. We'll go to the Eight.
I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.
Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?
Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.
Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.
Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.
Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea.
My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you dont make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life.
Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?
You, sidle? Y-You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!
So the roommate laughed at everything I said.
Well, it was the best of those movies.
Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.
Good, as a matter of fact. I almost had my own show in Japan.
(on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV for another minute) The letter, that's the letter!
Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time.
Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately.
Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually do it)
Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.)
The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.
The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.
Well, thats it. You two are back together.
Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that.
Do you even know what this scene is about?
(on the phone) Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.
Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? (hands Elaine the tape recorder.)
A half hour, give me a half our.
Dont worry about it, it wasnt working anyway.
I don't think so. Why would I do that?
Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?
Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?
I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!
I did not. You guys gonna go through some red lights?
I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright*, I forgive you...
He bothers me. I dont even answer the phone anymore because of him. Hes turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.
Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.
What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?
So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?
Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!
I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.
Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.
Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.
Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes.
Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt.
So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial?
Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet?
They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor.
What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!
Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, (looking at the TV) Kramer, turn that up.
It's been three days and he hasn't called.
Oh my god. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops!
Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.
Well, senator, Id just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it.
(Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.
Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.
I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.
I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?
That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.
Now, all we gotta do is write it.
So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.
I really think the M&M should be you.
You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.
Did you look at look at this picture carefully?
Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!
You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.
You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...
I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!
No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.
(smiling with pleasure) You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile.
I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.
Ramon, what are you doing here? You could get in trouble.
What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers.
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protg of my own.
Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.
Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.
So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER
By the way, just for the record -
Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!
They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.
I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes when someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within the gay community. They're probably discriminated against because of that, people say to them "Y'know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but I think think it's about time, y'know that you got in shape, tucked the shirt in and lost the wife". But if people are even going to assume that people that are neat are gay, maybe instead of doin' this, "Y'know I think Joe might be a little... [waves hand back and forth]", they should vacuum "Y'know I think Joe might be >vroom< [makes vacuuming motion]. Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little >vrooom<..."
Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?
You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.
But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.
I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go "Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!"
She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.
I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals.
No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?
"I dunno how you could forget . He kept reffering to himself in the third person. "Jimmy's under the boards. Jimmy's in the open. Jimmy makes the shot."
You gotta go to my chiropractor, hes the best.
Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You cant do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.
(surveying the restaurant) Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it!
oh you think she's Erika, the phone sex woman
Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?
Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. (And to George) What do you mean you can't tell me?
Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist.
So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here.
What would you say if I told you that...
Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.
I don't like this Kramer. Will it be much longer?
Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.
Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?
Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph?
Oh, great! Alright. (We hear the announcers calling the game.)
Hello. Didn't I see you at the pro shop yesterday?
Wait a minute, that's my ticket! You didn't even want to go.
Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you.
Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to rides alone.
If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened.
(locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.
I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)
Oh, I cant begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.
You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.
Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain?
Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.
Uhn-uh-uhn - Uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer A-Ha ha! Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe. (singing) dee, de-de, de-de-de-de-de (Makes G.I. Joe swim off, legs kicking)
Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?
Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--
Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?
Why dont they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, Just Back. All back; No front. You walk in the front, youre immediately in the back. (Jerry picks up a tie display, and shakes it rhythmically from left to right.) Look, Elaine, tie carwash.
Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?
Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I cant ask her.
(Looking down at the shirt; mumbling) Oh, thank you.
So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?
Yeah, theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.
He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. "I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"
I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give!
Well, maybe he doesn't have a "get outta here" kind of personality.
It's gotta have something to do with Kramer
No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!
They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again.
Who was in town on a business venture, and um..
He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.
(facing the lengthening line behind him) Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.
Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didnt take it. (pointing to himself) This is an idiot.
(to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?
Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.
You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.
Y-You didnt do anything. Its not you, its me. Its- this is very difficult.
Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?
I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.
...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code.
(bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.
Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah.
Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that "Miss Congeniality" on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going? (Kramer enters.) Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey, what are you doing tonight?
Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!
Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late.
What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?
Hey you know George isn't to happy, ahh, about your new friendship.
So you go in the bathroom at eleven your in bed by what, two?
You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it.
You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I give you 50 bucks.
The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.
And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She says, "That's funny." ... That's funny!
Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.
Elaine, he's a.. he's a male bimbo, he's a mimbo
(Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying.
Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.
Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.
(accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?
(Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.
What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.
No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.
No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.
Well this is a great place to sit you got here.
(in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine) So did you figure out Darryl's... you know.
What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like it?
Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?
I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.
It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.
It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.
Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.
Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
(Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-
(Reads the pill bottle) What kind of pills are these, anyways?! "For Smuckers"? "May cause panting and loss of fur"? (Turns to Kramer) These are dog pills!
I don't know , Who keeps track of Hellos.
All right. (picks up the alarm clock) Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 650... volume check. (music playing, he starts swinging) What kinda music you wanna wake up to? Top 40, classical...
Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! (Kramer gestures sympathetically) And who buries a bird?
(to the phone) Oh, its you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldnt have had to do this. Now thats two long distance calls I made to you why cant you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again; to nobody) Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much.
I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?
The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.
Well, this is it. I'm really gonna do something about my life, you know? You know, I think I'm gonna call Melanie again. So what if she shushed me. GEORGE, I am really gonna make some changes.
Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.
No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?
There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?
Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?
All right, that's not bad. Now get over here!
George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.
Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.
There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.
You didn't ... (makes motion like he's lighting a cigar)
Oh, w-what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore?
All right, all right. Whats the big hubbub, bub?
Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.
Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?
"...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!"
I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.
(long pause -- did he hear "ridicurous" -- should he say something -- can't decide if he should. Finally...) Did you say, "ridicurous"?
(To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.
Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.
Have you thought any more about that trip?
(animated) You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I...
All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape.
You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?
Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment.
Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.
(stopping them) We better not. (they make out some more; then stop) T-They're gonna be here any second.
I have an idea. (Elaine enters; to Elaine) We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three.
Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch?
Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . What could he do?
Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.
What, your sad little horsies, the house with the little curl of smoke, the sunflower with the smiley face. the transparent cube... (as she leaves)
(To Amy) Aha! So it's true! You were making out with him!
I asked. Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian football.
Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.
It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a "Tada!" gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say "I'll see ya.", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)
(Pulls the note out of his pocket) That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.
Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!
(hands it to him as he asks ELAINE) So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?
You know I can't get this *damn thing* to sleep. (about the Yo-Yo)
Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?
I'm gonna go let Elaine in. (Kramer reaches out to stop him leaving)
I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?
The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.
There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair, striped shirt?
Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, You think?
Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.
(pointing at the operation he mouths the words) Did it go in?
(Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.
This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.
Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, Yeah, I got this new thing Platonic. My idea, my name, callin it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- dont do anything, and go right home. Whatd you think? I think its going to be big! I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didnt work. Yknow, I bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, Uh, Hi, uh my names Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, its a Riconic relationship.
(Gesturing to Ellen) Kramer, George, this is Ellen.
You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends....
Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerrys office. (Elaine is looking confused). Were going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean hes already left?
Oh my god! Look what's goin' on here! She is depraved! (Grabs a towel and brings it to Lena.) There you are.
Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.
Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.
Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg.
Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.
Let's go out and celebrate! (they all get up)
Especially when you got a layover in Sarajevo. (Bosnia Herzegovina)
I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.
(Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.
Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.)
All right, she said she couldnt find a decent hotel room...
My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while.
(to Kramer and Morty) What is this about?
Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend. (puts his arm around Elaine's shoulder, but she shrugs it off twice)
I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'?
I'm in the book and I have a machine.
You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?
(outraged) He's a doctor!.I mean it's supposed to be like a sterile environment."
20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.
cool guy? what are you, in 8th grade?
You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.
Girls. There's girls right here in the store. Look, look, there's one over there. Look, there's another one. Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there. What's the matter?
Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?
(Trying to read the note) What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit.
Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!
Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now.
I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.
Well, its a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno...
Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll watch 'em go slice this fat bastard up. (sips coffee)
Im just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.
That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.
Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought.
I got you an apartment in the building.
I dont bother with him. Hes been calling me for seven years. Ive never called him once! Hes got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if hes paying attention.
No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.
You know, I really... Ive come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that theyre just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you dont really wanna see them. You dont call them, they call you. You dont call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you dont really have anything in common with is to pretend youre hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend theres a little desk around you. The only problem with this is theres no way you can say, Hey, its been great having you on the show. Were out of time.
You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught.
Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.
I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
(turning on the commercial) Right, quiet dignity. As opposed to, say, this?
So was I right? She likes me, right?
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.
Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.
hey, uh.. (Kramer walks around a little) what'd you get there?
(To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up)
So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?
Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard.
You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?
yeah yeah what is it with you and Tony? what are you? it's like his sidekick now?
Which part? The renovating the restaurant you dont own part or spending the two hundred million you dont have part?
I always feel bad for the silver medal winner in the Olympics. How do you live with that the rest of your life? People are gonna keep asking, "- How much did you lose by? - I don't even know...! It was like...(very fast) now.now...now.now..now..was like, like... now..now..now...! It was it...! Eh, it was it and I lost. I trained, I worked out, I exercised, I did everything, I was doing push-ups, sit-ups, I never did anything but exercise and work out for 20 years, I flew half way around the world and aaaaaaaaaah!...(showing a tiny distance between his index and thumb) And that was...it was a photo-finish! Silver...(stretching his neck forward)...gold. If I had a pimple, I would've won.
So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouth-to-mouth.
The captain of the toes. (phone rings) Hello.
But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?
They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing."
Uh, you know, why dont you go first, you just had a long trip.
Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?
Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.
(moving over to block the door) Where are you going?
I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.
(trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.
(to the phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)
What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them.
Oh, big fighting marlin. (Jerry acts like he is catching a marlin)
Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide.
(after a very awkward pause, cheerily) Hey, neighbor.
Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.
No. This is why you're not in the pilot.
I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!
See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup...
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?
Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.
So you just pretended it didnt bother you?
It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.
(Pulls a small bottle out of his pocket) Uh-huh. Hey, look what they had on the plane. Schnapps.
Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton. **
Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)
No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.
Hello Elaine? Patty Lawrence had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?
Okay, how about this I'm in my apartment, you come in.
There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?
Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.
But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.
Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign.
And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.
Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?
Oh who made you a Mohel? Whadya, get your degree from a matchbook?
Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.
Uh, you don't have to take a picture.
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.
You know, what you need is a song you can share.
Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.
Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you?
(Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.
No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?
In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.
"I don't know how you can eat that spicy chicken,"
If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.
Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.
Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.
Got it. (but now a man-hand grabs his arm) Uh!
Okay, you tell me. What is it worth?
Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?
(Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this.
What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do whatever it is you do. You disgust me.
Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...
Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.
So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?
Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.
So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?
Why don't you go out? It's nice out.
I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, "This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here."
I don't know. That's like asking "Where's Waldo?"
"I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite."
Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!
Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, "You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"
Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip.
Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!
(agreeing) well three years is a long time to be married.
I think thats the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!
Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend.
How you gonna get out of *that* one?
You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
H... G... F. Seat four. One, two, three... f-- Hello Newman.
How much was it to clean the vest?
No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.
Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later.
Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.
I dont know. Its got a pink lining.
Just get the key and let's get out of here.
If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened.
We're in the middle of a discussion here.
You are the Queen of Confrontation. Youre my new hero. In fact, youve inspired me. Im gonna call George about something right now.
Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love!
No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.
What! You're the one who ruined her life.
More cereal? that's your third bowl today, you had it for breakfast and lunch.
You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?
Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?
Hello, oh hi Duncan, 400 o'clock tomorrow? That is not going to work. . . . Why? I'll tell you why. Because I chose not to run!
You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you... (catches himself)
Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.
Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.
Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot.
How do you get all that wood in here?
(throws out his hands) What does he listen to? The all Desperado station?
See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey George, look, I'm not funny now.
This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy.
Yeah, well, I didnt- Is that something you want to borrow?
Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?
Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there by two o'clock. We should take a cab.
I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!
Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.
Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.
Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation.
Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?
Ah, here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) Mmm, delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some.
You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs.
All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.
Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door)
So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.
Let me call him back... Hello? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.
I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.
Well, what kind of a kiss? Was it a peck? Was it a kiss? Was it a long make out thing?
Oh my eh, my Aunt's name is Mulva. She's-she's a masseuse.
Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something.
That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.
So, uh, whats your son doing now, Dr. Stevens? Oh, hes a public fornicator. Yes, hes a fine boy...
Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.
(going through couch cushions) Where the hell did I put this?
(proud to Peggy, under his breath) Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. (winks)
Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.
(downcast) No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've been so helpful.
All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.
For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.
Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?
The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.
Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.
You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.
We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
But your were an executive, this is fast food.
.. and uh, underwear and a tee shirt.
Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please.
Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?
No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.
Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits on a couch.) Hey, what about this one?
The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California!
(getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.
(Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!
Back and to the left Back and to the left
Now we have to buy a new couch?!
That voice. That voice. Shes driving me crazy.
All right. How 'bout this one let's say you're abducted by aliens.
Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?
Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be.
Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! (Kramer is speechless) I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet.
Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?
(picking at his moustache) You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.
Well, you know what they say. Lucky in love, Unlucky with fruit.
I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!
I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.
All right, now you call it in the air.
I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.
Yeah, and youre just what shes looking for too  a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.
Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.
Well, its a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.
Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.
Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)
(reading on) "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-"
Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh, Ketchup? Pretty name for a girl.
Anyway Beth, you know i was thinking on my way over how when i was 9. I wanted these handball sneakers, they were all black but they came in adult sizes so you know i never got the sneakers. (Beth looks him confused)
(looking of into the distance) I guess that's true...
You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back.
All right, lets go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.
Super bowl! Hey, an original G.I. Joe. (picks up both items) With a full frogman suit.
Well, just give it back, and I wont say anything.
A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?
And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!
Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.
What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these, like Superman? I've got to unlock this mystery.
(leafing through his mail) Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.
I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
I love these nature shows, Ill watch and kind of nature show, and its amazing how you can always relate, to whatever theyre talking about. You know like youre watching the African Dung Beetle and youre going Boy, his life is a lot like mine. And you always root for whichever animal is the star of the show that week -- like if its the antelope, and theres a lion chasing the antelope you go, Run antelope Run! Use your Speed, Get away! But the next week its the lion, and then you go Get the antelope, eat him, bite his head! -- Trap him, dont let him use his speed!
So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you this thing was good!
This is the man you have a crush on?
Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want? You're not a part of society.
Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more.
I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.
There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of... (he cracks) Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?!
OUR LIVES!! . What kind of lives are these? We're like children. We're not men.
Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, they'll believe us.
You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?
Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.
Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.
That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.
Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?
(is redialing) I should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.
The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?
Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's got this strangest habit. She eats her peas one at a time. You've never seen anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. I mean, we've had dinner other times. I've seen her eat Corn Niblets. But she scooped them.
alright I changed my mind, uh yeah I don't think I'm not gonna go now
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers...
Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.
(pause) If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?
I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?
I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.
Yknow, my parents are coming in for this...
Im gonna make an appointment for you. Well go together.
(Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla.
And she was beautiful in that bra! I'm crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging, free wheeling attitude!
Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.
Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime.
Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?
I think it has something to do with me.
Everyday is my birthday. (Sarcastically joking off what George said)
I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?
He's... trying to get something off his chest.
Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired.
I can't figure out what's going on here. I can't follow the plot. Why did they kill that guy? I thought he was with them?
What are you looking at? (Kramer goes out onto the terrace and looks down.) Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold.
You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?
In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?
Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
Why would he steal a box of raisins?
Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.
I don't have any change. You've got any change?
I saw one once that could do sign language.
You know you're not supposed to drink while you're keeping a secret! (Elaine laughs) Is there anything else?
So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?
(Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So, the last person in should close the door!
Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour.
And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table)
You'll be out before we get the check.
You're passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago!
(to George) Snow. Snow, that cant be good for suede, can it?
Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--
Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?
Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.
Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.
Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.
How ya doing? (George nods) Can't talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his brace) Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his eyebrows) I like that. (George sticks his tongue out) So how's life without tonsils? (George quickly indicates with his arm that he wants ice cream) What? What's that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?.. (George signals that it's more) Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy.. (George motions for ice cream again) What are you doing?
Yeah but theres a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet.
Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
All right, just give me a western. (unhappy)
Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I?
Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.
That is so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood horse?
Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.
Yeah thats a good deal -- you win the Pennant with that trade, hair for phlegm.
You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.
No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I wouldve said tonight.
Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.
It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.
You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?
I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.
Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?
Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?
Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!
Hey, thanks a lot for lettin' me stay here.
Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.
Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.
We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!
Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself.
Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.
(smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good.
Thats the bet! That youre not doing it!
Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?
Yep. Since college. (Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.) Hey, Lena Small's on this list.
Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.
Oh, excuse me... Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.
You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?
They did it for three years. What's another few months.
And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.
I was going to say, "Being a good host."
I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.
(Takes the bottle from him) Just swallow 'em.
Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame.
Were taking Elaine to dinner. Shes got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?
How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go.
(To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?
Kramer , there's no way you're sleeping with me.
Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that?
How are we gonna get out of it?
Well if he's going then I'm not going.
So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) "Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again." They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system..."Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to the plane in my apartment." You see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet "hide-a-key" under the wing..."maybe he left it up there somewhere..."
Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.
Ill call Kramer. He can check my house.
All right, I'll see you after school. I,,m late for Hayman's hygiene.
Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.
What should I do, should I call the police?
What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What are you Peter Lorre?
Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?
No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.
Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full.
I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around..
Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours?
(Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?
So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm gonna try to sell the van to a lot.
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer, say it isn't so.
..And then she starts talking about her panties.
Ah. But they told us we must go now.
Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?
Hello? Oh, hi honey. (annoyed, weary) Yes, I told him. I'll get it. (George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry to argue with Meryl on the phone.) Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...
(Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..
But they not you arent handicapped, arent you ashamed?
They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
It's alright, I want you to have it.
Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.
Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log.
I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door...
Well, I don't think I want to date a protg whose mentor is a Costanza.
No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time?
The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.
(Fed up) Alright! Excuse me! (Gets up) I'm not buying any of this!
Well, theres this uh, woman might be comin in.
Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?
Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger.
Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. (indicating) Come on in. You got the cigars?
I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.
Oh really? (tries turning away in the hopes Elaine gets the hint; thinking) Oh God, I gotta get out of this.
Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener - what other conclusion could one reach? (The phone rings.)
Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?
All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! Just wait here and I'll get it for you. ... Kramer this is Tia.
Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?
They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
That's enough. (They leave. George comes around the corner.)
So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?
Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?
I don't believe this. (They run into theater)
I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.
Yeah, yeah. Sometimes shes on time, and... sometimes shes late.
No, no I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like the title and insisted that he change it to "War and Peace"!
Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie.
Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?
Hello,  oh hi Elaine .. what's going on  no he just left  you broke up with him?  ME TOO .. what happened?  oh smoking you know you're like going out with C. Everet Coope  me  nah  I couldn't go through with it  I just didn't feel ready  so what are you doing now?  Oh, great idea, I'll meet you there in like thirty minutes. Okay bye.
Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.
All right, so youre chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead.
Let me see that. (Jerry looks at the tag.) That is high.
No, let's just do it. (Fire alarm goes off) What? What is going on? What is that about?
So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these types of people.
People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Uh, gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. Alright let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... (looks at Joe; Joe gives him a weird look)ooo, just right... and three plantains uh ought to do it.
Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school.
You told me that already like two months ago.
My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!
Yeah, I cant eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I cant dance.
Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town.
Because she's my wife! (The door buzzer sounds; Jerry answers it) Yeh?
Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?
Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle?
Well, I'm very mysterious by nature. (Jerry knocks on the door) A lot of women find that attractive.
Well, whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.)
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!
So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing?
What the hell...? Why is the door open?
Oh, that guy was your cousin! (walking in front of George so he gets the picture to leave)
Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night.
She went out to get her head shaved.
(to George) I mean, come on. (a thought occurs) No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from *Seals and Croft*.
No, I think I would have remembered Memma.
Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?
I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?
(doubtful) Yeah, you'll make it up to me.
Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.
But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?
Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game.
Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...
Whenever I see the news and they're hauling in some kind of terrorist, psycho, maniac, mass murderer guy. You notice he's always covering up his face with the newspaper, with the jacket, with the hat. What is he worried about? I mean what is this man's reputation? That he has to worry about this kind of exposure damaging his good name? I mean, what is he up for a big job promotion down at the office or something? Afraid the boss is gonna catch this on TV and go "isn't that Johnson from sales? He's up in that clock tower picking people off one by one. I don't know if that's that kind of man we want heading up that new branch office. He should be in bill collection. I think he's got aptitude."
He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.
No, no Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.
Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...
Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop, clip clop. They're nuts for it.
Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket.
Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.
Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.
I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? "You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know "No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back."
Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 630 and gimme a call.
You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?
Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?
You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?
(on phone) Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act (pauses for response from Adrian) No new material (Elaine enters) He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week, it killed. (waves hello to Elaine; pauses for response from Adrian) Thank you, thanks fo.. you will not regret this. Ok, Bye. (hangs up phone; to Elaine) Hey.
Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.
And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard-working Americans!
I don't have your suit. I gave it away.
Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it.
You're lucky they let you drive a car.
And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.
Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. and we got to talking, he sells Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.
All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go.
You got a lot to learn about pancakes.
(to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)
Oh, Im sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.
You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples clothes
Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.
I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.
She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.
You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.
I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.
What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead.
I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.
You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.
(quietly, yet in a high and whiney tone) Well, I don't know if I....
Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money?
It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.
(stares at George, incredulous) "Back on"? What was it doing off?
(to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...
I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?
This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.
Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal.
Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.
Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.
Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.
(Continuing reading) "The Human Fund. Money for people."
(pointing to napkins; to Elaine) Could I get napkin over there?
You unwittingly made a major commitment. That's a lot of pressure.
It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.
(to George) All right, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend Im disappointed. Youre going to really see me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this. Maybe you should go in the other room.
You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.
So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out Im giving you a raise.
Vandelay Industries, Kel Varnsen speaking. May we help you? ... Oh Hi Keith. Na, I was just jokin' around
402? (Checks his wristwatch) Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup!
Is it...? Could it...? Could he have...? IT IS! (Grabs Kramer.) Poppie peed on my sofa!!
Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
Well, Ill tell you what. Ill choose you for it. Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...thats it, you gotta win three.
Ohh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands. So.. (Goes for his coat)
(Singing) Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!
Franco's no good? ...They got no team leaders.
Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.
Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper of the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack . . .
But if you go back with me , then I'm not.
Hey I don't even want the pen now!
What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.
(turning to Elaine; thinking) Oh no, not now.
(in a tuxedo) So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a woman that won't have sex with you.
Technically, you're sauted. So, what are you doing for that?
Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.
Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!
Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.
Well, you want to sit with George? I think he's coming with Robin.
Let me see those. ( smells them) Oh! I know the chunky that left these Chunkies......NEWMAN!!! I've got him.
No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.
Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...
Were you crying? I mean, its just a grape. Youll find it.
...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, "Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now." "This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration." You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration, (waves imaginary wallet) "Here's fifty-six people that know me." Cop goes. "Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check."
Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye.
So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.
(Excited) I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!
Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at no more than three miles an hour.
What do you think? It's like a poker game?
Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'
No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?
This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!
She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?
Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.
No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!
Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.
Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.
Wait a second. .Just give me a second
(on the phone) Hello? No, Im sorry Bania ... Im not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye.
A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision.
Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.
(buzzes her up) Eh. (to Kramer) You know and I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying "my wife." Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - "my wife" this, "my wife" that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence.
Im Jerry, Elaines friend, and this is George.
In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.
I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...
So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.
I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?
There's no watch ... I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep good time. My parents gave it to me, but I didn't like it. So don't mention it again, okay!
He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about "Jerry."
The female orgasm is kinda like the bat cave, very few people know where it is and if you're lucky enough to see it you probably don't know how you got there and you can't find your way back after you left. There are two types of female orgasms, the real and the fake. And uh I'll tell you right now, as a man, we don't know. We do not know, because to a man sex is like a car accident and determining the female orgasm is like being asked 'What did you see after the car went out of control?'. 'Uh I heard a lot of screeching sounds, uh I remember I was facing the wrong way at one point. And in the end my body was thrown clear.'
Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?
No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
How can you think of food at the time like this?
Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
Uh, yeah. (broaching a subject) Hey uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to a meeting.
Why should I have anything for say for myself?
I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem.
(turning to each other) I dont know. Hes an importer.
I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.
But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.
(coming out from the bathroom) who was it?
ALL RIGHT, COME ON UP (Jerry puts his head down - he's not looking forward to Kenny Bania)
Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.
And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?
There's girls everywhere. I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator. They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?
It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something.
(Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.
Im going out. (he comes out of the dressing room, while Kramer remains inside)
I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.
Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.
(emphatic) I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!
I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.
Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.
You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?
(impatiently cutting in) Hey Elaine What about the crest.? What d'you think of the crest here.
She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults. Things you would know very little about.
...I got you an apartment in this building.
He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.
No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.
You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.
Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?
Well, the pickle breath is a good start.
What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?
TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.
No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.
You know what? No champagne. Anyway. . . I'll see you later.
Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's.
Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist enters Monk's)
(Trying to explain) Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past.
Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to go?
Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, "Those aren't buoys." (Father starts laughing) Father...
Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...
(animated) They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!
Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?
Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.
How many times you been out with him?
Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.
You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?
I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?
You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.
Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio.
Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?
Ive got the softball game on Wednesday. Its the championship.
Are you sure he cant hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.
Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.
(takes the card from Elaine) We had a little fight this afternoon. (reading from card) Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe.
Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?
All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little.
Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?
Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.
Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?
No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?
(Stops pulling on the pants) Alright, alright, That's no good. (Moves Kramer over to the couch) Let me try getting them from the bottom. (Goes for Kramer's Leg) Just gimme one leg.
How would you describe the smell in this house?
Yeah, that's a deal. That's a terrible deal. I don't want to go out to dinner with him. Id rather make my own suit.
Right. For the reducing of the pond scum?
Ohhh... You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.
(upset) Ohhhh, what are you doing? Kessler, its a tape! I taped the game, its one oclock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.
(animated) You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about.
(interrupts) I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.
I didn't know it was possible not to know that.
Uh huh. When youre on a stakeout, do you find its better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?
I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.
Well, how much are you going to invest?
Well, I painted my apartment again. Ive been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, its a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize its just the thickness of the paint, but Im aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, its closer and closer. I dont even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. Thats where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control... Thats why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching TV. Thats why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there.
Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!
So get this we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.
What do you need a job, you got Audrey.
Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler.
If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.
Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign.
There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing *just* a bra. I can't get that image out of my mind.
There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?
Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?
All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the bottle of fungicide.)
Hey look, there's a spot right in front.
She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass.
I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.
"You find you need to use a lot of obscenities at the dentist.
But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.
Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?
That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. (goes knocking on Kramer's)
Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.
Im not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. Ive decided Ill do the work. Im gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? Cause you send your money out there  working for you  a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me. Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.
(looks in the creamer) Theres no milk in here, what...
These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin' to make that call! (George comes in)
No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.
How about when Harrison Ford jumped out of that plane, and he was shooting back at them as he was falling?
Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.
If they were fanatic about showers, they might.
If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?
(Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?
Dont do the apples. Its enough already with the apples.
Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.
What's going on here. How is that possible?
No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car.
That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little off.
Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.
Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind.
It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.
I mean I'm happy sometimes, but-but not now.
I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.
But you know... not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me.
So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian...
Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.
So lemme ask you this how long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night.
Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.
All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.
You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?
Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)
(after Bookman exits) That is one tough monkey! (turns to Elaine) So you were saying?
Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.
A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.
(thinking) I cant believe it. I got nothing! I dont even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...
So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?
No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking.
Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?
What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?
Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it?
Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.
Oh, yes. Particularly if youre not in it.
(impressed) Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.
Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.
There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?
Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.
Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.
If there's a serial killer lose in your neighborhood, it seems like the safest thing is to be the neighbor. They never kill the neighbor. The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right? "Oh, he was kind of quiet." I love these neighbors. They're never disturbed by the sounds of murdering, just stereo. Chain saws, people screaming, fine. Just keep the music down. And all these women who always fall in love with the serial killer. They write to him in prison. Here's a woman that's hard to disappoint. I guess she's only upset when she finds out he's stopped killing people and she goes "You know sometimes I feel like I don't even know who you are anymore".
Oh, like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping carts with one bad wheel?
Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, "Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. " "What are you watching?" "I don't care, I gotta keep going." "Who was that?" "I don't know what it was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going." Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, "Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel." You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, "Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of here. I'm going to bed."
Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in!
"The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour". I'm confused.
(Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.
Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!
No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.
(Still pulling on Kramer's pants from the ankles) Man these are tight. (Yanking) Squinch your hips in
I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.
You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?
(walking towards door with Elaine) How long did you last? (opens door)
Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.
Yeah, dont investigate, dont pay me back, it was an accident.
It would be nice to care about someone.
Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.
Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document.
Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?
He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.
Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this uh considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check?
I mean that's fine if that's who you are...
Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.
Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!
I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.
So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!
I'm not talking about upside down. (Jean-Paul and Kramer come in) I'm talking about waking him up!
Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-
I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life.
Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman...
Coincidence? This guys in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment?
It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
(unenthusiastic) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) Im just, Im really glad youre here.
So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.
(a la "Don Corleione") Elaine, never ask me about my business!.... (SHEEPISH) "Godfather."
Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.
It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.
Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.
Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?
All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.
Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test.
Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket.
Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral?
Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls down, make it an eight room luxury suite.
No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.
Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.
Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone? You wanted the machine. You know, and you're always kind of thrown off, (left hand up to side of face, pretending its a receiver) you go "Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you."
What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?
Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?
It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.
I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?
Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for?
And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.
This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
(turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isn't that your charter group?
(he hits a few keys and looks over at her) Cash advance... yes (hits a key)  no (he looks over again) balance inquiry... no (he looks again) receipt.... no (he looks again) processing... processing... (He opens the box, pulls out his money and then looks at the woman and says) I won!
Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you?
Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way.
Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him)
Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...
Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!
Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat!
Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.
No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.
What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp, why do you want shade?
You're really going to town with that turkey there.
What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like theyre trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?
"No no you said George likes spicy chicken."
Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?
Ah, just, you know, I don't know. Stuff, I gotta do. (grabs coat and throws it over his shoulder)
How long did you leave it up there?
1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass!
I dunno , I'm gonna ask Shelley ,but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident.
Yeah. (pointing at Elaine as he goes into the bedroom)
What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!
How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean, it's only this wide!
who do you think she is? how dare she? you want me to get the manager? too bad they don't have those old ladies walking around with flashlights anymore we'd flush her out
Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.]
That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!
(cutting in) I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman.
So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.
Oh, see the baby again with the baby..
Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys.
All right. That's it, I can't work like this.
Maybe we should get you to a hospital.
I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldnt do that.
Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?
Whats to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.
Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.
Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.
It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.
There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.
(Shouting) Come on up! (Opens his door for Elaine)
I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...
So what? A lot of older men have that.
Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?
Hey! Same initials . How do you like that?
(Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What?
George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'
"Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable..." Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been "outed"! I wasn't even "in"!
So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?
Course you may not see it for twenty years.
I know, and then you say to yourself, From this moment on, Im not gonna waste any more of it. But then you go, How? What can I do thats not wasting it?
Hey, what happened to your coat? And what is the smell? Is-ya, What are you drunk?
(Noting) You know, I've never seen you drive.
Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.
Religion, my friend, thats what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that its going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.
Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?
Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if its done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels!
Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.
The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!
Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?
And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.
I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" thing.
Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.
I think I heard her say something about a bench.
Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't do you favors after you dump them.
12 gauge. Seems to be the most popular gauge.
Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money..
Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless.
Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?
Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?
Um, actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet. (takes the paper back)
Your breath is fine. It's delightful, it's delicious.
You know, we never had one fight before this deal.
You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.
...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.
Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry.
So what happened? You gave her my tax papers? ... My papers?
Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.
Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. Alright, it's time to go. Come on.. Up.
Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up)
No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!
So you say she was on a horse?
Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)
That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice.
Alright, come on, lets get out of here.
No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?
(noticing a coffee table book) Oh, you got the Civil War book. I saw some of that show, it was wonderful.
No, I had to tell my friends  my friends didnt have to tell you.
Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.
Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. Its completely shrunk. Theres absolutely no way I can wear it.
(stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem?
(weary) Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out?
How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet!
Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do.
Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.
Oh. yeah. Alright. (pushes Kramer and Elaine out the door, then sits next to Sidra on the couch.) So, where were we?
Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly) and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it.
Fine all done, just looking for the soap.
Oh yeah? I dont believe youve seen... this.
Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up(?). Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.
Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!
Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.
I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!
I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal?
So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.
(smiling) Really? That's great. You said that to him?
(Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.
YEAH? (speaking loudly so the visitor can hear him through the intercom)
(sits on the back of the couch) Oh my god.
Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. I'm being audited.
And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
George, I've been sick all week. Elaine was too. Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes. Do the math. Yeah, maybe I will get out. Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first. Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something. Yeah, Selwyn's. Okay bye.
(Walks over and starts pulling on Kramer's pants) You just gotta wiggle your hips a little bit.
Hey. Why didn't cha get the big one?
I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.
I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?
No, I told you, it's just a dry run.
You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.
I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table.
Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...
All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? (sits opposite George)
Oh, see that's not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people.
Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.
Hes a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.
All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now, be reasonable you cannot turn down $50 for a $6 rye.
It's a cigar store Indian. (to Elaine) Read the card.
Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did!
(Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal.
It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.
Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god. Wel-- how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud.
First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.
Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it is. (vehement) Just take it!
everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah?
Yeah well King Edward didnt live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.
No, you stay here in the car. I may need you.
How do you like that? (tries to turn away again; thinking)Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I cant, I cant. Im stuck.
Just, uh, plop it on the counter there.
Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?
I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all.
That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.
I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!
I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.
No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.
OK, fine. 'What do I have to do to put you in this van today?'
I couldnt tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that
What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?
Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president James Polk!" (ELAINE had echoed "Uh-huh. Yup." during it)
No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up?
(flips a roll of paper towels in the air) Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.
It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.
Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.
(His thoughts) I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver.
It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.
One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub.
I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.
Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs.
Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.
"I don't think so. I think they were getting dressed and not only that; my shirt was out!!!"
I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..
I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high.
You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand?
(Unsure of what to say - he remember's Leo's courtesy tip) Hello?
All right lets go. We'll meet you back down here in ten minutes, hopefully with the money.
No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.
(Fast) Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me!
Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?
So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.
Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.
Yea. (pulls at the t-shirt) This is Golden Boy's son Baby Blue.
(Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.
I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles.
Nothing. I'm sure "Jon" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! (Laughs uproariously.)
I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy.
(To George) Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?
No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.
What, are you serious...why, why did she call?
Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!
No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?
youre a real pleasure. (Jerry is being sarcastic)
The one Puddy screamed at in the car?
(walking away) Well, I didn't sleep with her.
The apple pie you had today at Monks
George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?
You're still trying to gget that free sub?
Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.
Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes outside)
Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.
Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.
Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!
Kramer! (tries to hide he's upset and jealous)
Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?
I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I dont get this. Arent cows outside most of the time? I dont understand it. When its raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, Let us in, were all wearin leather. Open the door! Were gonna ruin the whole outfit here! Is it suede? I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I cant have this cleaned. Its all I got!
(Fishing for his keys in a kitchen drawer) You know, when I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time.
I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something!
Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.
What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present)
Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy.
You spent the night at James's? Did we?
Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.
In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.
Course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.
Hey, have fun at the... family reunion. (George exits) So, what do you know about this Jack fellow?
Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.
Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?
Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!
Are you sure? Oh boy, here we go.
Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.
The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like youre always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. Youre out somewhere with people, Gee, you look pregnant.. are you? Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, thats not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Lets take this whole scene again. People, think about what youre saying!
Right in the head! (leans in and points at Testikov)
Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.
Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.
Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!
Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me?
I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.
Yeah, yeah, take care of it. (Jerry throws her some toilet paper) Come on, George, what is it?
Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.
They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!
(interrupting) No no it's ok. (walking Rachel out) So we'll go see Schindler's List later right?
(to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here.
Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?
This is a person I like, its not How to score on spring break.
I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.
(thinking to himself; picks up a tube) "Fungicide". Fungus?
So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.
All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar).
I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)
You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown?
How did you lock your keys in the car?
All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.
(Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?
The old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go "how do you like crotch?" If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly.
That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.
Good shake. Perfect shake. Single pump, not too hard, you know, doesn't have to prove anything, but, you know, firm enough to know he was there.
..living together after a while we... we might start to get on each others nerves a little.
The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. Cause it says Waiting Room. Theres no chance of not waiting. Cause they call it the waiting room, theyre gonna use it. Theyve got it. Its all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and youve got your little magazine. You pretend youre reading it, but youre really looking at the other people. You know, youre thinking about about them. Things like, I wonder what hes got. As soon as she goes, Im getting her magazine. And then, they finally call you and its a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. Well, I guess Ive been chosen. Ill see you all later. You know, so you think youre going to see the doctor, but youre not, are you? No. Youre going into the next waiting room  the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You dont wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You dont want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in? Do they scalp tickets to these things? I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two...
It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.
So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.
But thats what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. Theyre knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus.
You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...
Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?
Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without.
So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, "Jerry"? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They're putting it on the air! They're giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California!
That orange dress is burned in my memory
(admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.
Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses... I need an awkward pause.
So what are you going to do with the mattress?
(arriving at apartment, sees Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from Kramer's) So you live right... there.
Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?
Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people.
There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.
Oh (laughing) Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting.
Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.
No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.
Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?
Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?
Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...
The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.
Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?
Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I, guess she passed out!
Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.
(thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.
It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.
When did you get tickets to see that?
I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?
So, you wanna come up for a few minutes?
No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls.
Whats with the pink lining and the candy stripes?
Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!
But there's no "t" in your name. What about G-bone?
Shes waking down the street and it hit her in the head!
(Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat.
(Nervous laughter) Yeah.. like a pirate.. (Attempting to get on another subject) Anyway, ah, you know, we're hoping to, um, raise enough money.. with this.. uh..
(Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?
I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me "C'mon Jerry, go along, go along..."
What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him? I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he?
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.
There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts.
Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?
(To himself) I don't believe this! (Walks over to a security guard) Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with shoplifting..
But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?
You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married.
Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?
Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!
That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?
I can't go until I find my cufflinks.
Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.
(places two slices of bread against Kramer's face) That is close.
Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to Elaine)
Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...
All right now you listen and you listen good! (he grabs Kramer's legs and throws him down the couch)
Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, "Make sure you hang on to your jacket."
Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? Im sorry. I didnt mean it. I took it out on you. Were still friends. Were still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, Ill tell you what. Ive got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.
Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?
Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me (flustered, he indicates a nose pick)
(holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the fridge?
That was Elaine , she changed her mind. She's not coming over.
Yes it will, now give me those keys!
I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?
Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?
Oooh! I got a pain in my side.
(looking at the TV) Look at the picture on this thing...
Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?
Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.
Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and tear.
Hmm. So you feel "women and children first," in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.
Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up)
Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in.
All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.
Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?
Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, thats a good idea.
tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.
Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?
Thats the bet! (The phone rings; Jerry answers it.) Hello?... No- oh, hi... (Kramer leaves) no, they just left... Oh, my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch em. (Jerry goes over to the window and opens it; calling out the window) Ma! Ma! Up here! Dont get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!!
Well you've really built yourself up into something.
What do you mean you're in the same class?
I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses!
(Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled "Ori-dent") Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!
Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way.
I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?
We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy.
Oh! man did you see that. I ate discarded food.
No, shes a little too cheery for me.
Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?
(to Kramer) So how's your karate class going?
Women need to like the job of the guy theyre with. If they dont like the job, they dont like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. Well, right now, Im the regional management supervisor. Im in development, research, consulting... Men on the other hand  if they are physically attracted to a woman  are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men dont really care. Menll just go, Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? Youre just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why dont you shower up, and well get some burgers and catch a movie.
Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is.
Thirty-six. What's the signal? Howbout this? Chicken wing? No, no, no, I got a better one. Head patting.
You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.
Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.
Great, I had fun. Wheres the TV, wheres the VCR?
Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am  rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give...
Youre you. Were having lunch with Art Corvelay.
He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. He's a time slot hit.
Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?
Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations.
Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. Its the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... (Jerry pushes the door shut.) ...MUST BE CLOSED!!
Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!
This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.
Donna, really, youre making too much of this.
Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.
Oh...yeah...uh you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.
(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the plot. It's embarrassing. It's an embarrassment to have to admit, but I'm the one that you see in the parking lot after the movie talking with his friends, going, "Oh, you mean that was the same guy from the <beginning>... Ohhhhhhhhhh..." Nobody will explain it to you. When you're in the theater, you can't find out. [whispering to imaginary friends seated around him] "Why did they kill that guy?... Why did they kill him?... Who was that guy? What was the... I thought he was with them? Wasn't he with them? Why would they kill him if he was with them? Oh, he wasn't *really* with them.... I thought he was with them. It's a good thing they killed him.''
You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.
Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?
This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.
Yeah, and, (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly exiting) time.
Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
Ill have the, ah, turkey club without the bacon.
It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld.
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.
Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!
(impatient) Gone! (starts maniacally laughing) (briefly stops to point and explain) That bumper sticker.
(cont) and this whole justice league, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman. You mean to tell me Superman can't cover everything?
No, it's tarragon. Hey Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had about you having my apartment keys and everything.
So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?
Shes right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, Im gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.
After one date you try and improvise on her machine?
The bad fianc&Mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...
(Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?
You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.
I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it.
(taps George's chest) Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six.'
Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?!
(testing Joel) So, Im thinking about going to Iran this summer.
I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.
But then anyone can just look in and see you.
Yeah, its some place down in the village.
Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid...
(dry) I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw? (really disappointed) Let's get out of here George.
Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited.
And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus
Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this? (moves his arm) He's gonna think you're a mental patient.
(to George) He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.
I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.
So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?
Well, then Im not going to the game either. Okay? Ill give him both tickets.
Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.
What, do you think I care about the money? Is that what you think? You want me to show you what I care about money? Here look, here look at this, here's a dollar here look, there, that?s how much I care about money.
There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing.
(on phone) Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago.
Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting.
Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?
No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.
Pam? What do you care? (Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying a Brentano's bookstore bag.)
...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.
Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.
Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.
Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.
You should have her work on it for you.
That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without the cushy timeslot.
Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.
Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.
You want to go to Mendys, Ill take you to Mendys.
(Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my domain. But I will tell you this I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!
Why did you force that mint on me? I told ya I didn't want the mint!
I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
(Knocking on Kramer's door) Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey.
All of a sudden it hit me, I realized what the problem is; I can't be with someone like me.. I hate myself!! If anything I need to get the exact opposite of me....It's too much. It's too Much I can't take it ...I can't take it!!!
So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?
I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I cant stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion wont even exist. It wont. I think eventually well all be wearing the same thing. Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where theres people from the future or another planet, theyre all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided, This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and boots. Thats it. We should come up for an outfit for Earth. An Earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits. No speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, That was nice. I could wear that.
(also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it.
I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.
Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal.
It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.
With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.
It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.
What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.
Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.
Where have you been? You know, you're on next.
Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.
So what about the "Maestro" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.
(Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing is now?? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!
Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.
(continuing unphased) You wanna get the other end, cause I wanna get it in the hall.
You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?
Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place.
How can you talk to someone like that?
(privately amused) Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while. (indicating Elaine) Her too.
Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.
This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it..
Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.
Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.
No, but he's not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR)
Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.
Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?
Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.
I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?
Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.
What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's - it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it, and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you. (Nodding)
It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.
You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.
Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing "no") A little taste! (still shaking) Come on. (still shaking)
How can I want it now, if you want it?
..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye. HA Ha..Who do these women think they're dealing with? Did she think she was gonna leave this incredibly erotic message on my tape and I was just gonna let it go. Not Bloody likely...
Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.
Alright, I'm gonna get this. This looks good.
So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the Spokes model category?
Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!
Do you have to write all this stuff down.
No, no, no. I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.
Hey, I had nothing to do with it.
Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh...
Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.
Could you move your car back a little?
He used to go there a lot on business.
Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.
Hi. Hi Winona. Nice to see you again.
He can't just throw me off the plane!
Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.
Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.
What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?
(To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.
But you made it through the day before.
Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.
It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.
Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give it back to me.
Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.
That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino.
It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?
Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there.
I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there.
It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.
First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?
I thought you were going out with Celia?
Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.
You know what the odds are on a crash it's a million to one.
Ugh, the four worst words in the English language.
Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!
(What's goin' on,) like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--
No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car.
I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)
Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye.
Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!
It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.
I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!
Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.
Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.
(walking over the the buzzer to answer it) Oh, that's the Flicks.
Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!
I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.
All right, the whole elevator business, let me just explain-
Ma! Ma! MAAA! (Hangs up the phone in disgust.) Oh, ahhhh (sighs quietly)
I don't understand what the big deal is.
Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!
Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.
I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?
You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
Well I don't want to take too much off.
But the question is, are you still master of your domain?
"Just one....gotta go back.....Oh but get this. Elaine, you will appreciate this. I'm sitting in Tim Whatley's waiting room...He's got a Penthouse right out on the table."
Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.
(to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)
It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.
I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
Hey, guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!
That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact.
I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.
Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, "Why knock my brains out?"
So it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato.
I cant believe this. So what are you saying? You didnt like my act, so thats it?
What're you doing? I thought you were changing.
Well we went out one time. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?
All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?
So ah, what did you do last night?
What do you mean? Why wouldn't I know his name?
Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?
Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
(Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?
Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what are you doing?
But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?
Hey listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, why don't you have dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if you want, you know, have a little company, take the pressure off.
Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.
I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.
(imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape?
Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.
Thats not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table repeatedly.) You know, maybe its not that bad an idea.
On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?
Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George.
You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.
Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?
Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?
She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.
And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.
This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.
(pause) I thought you said... "ridicurous." (Donna looks puzzled)
This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.
All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura opens the door and gets out). What? What?
Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.
(Hands him some mail) There you go. Merry Chirstmas!
Soon as I get off the phone wih you.
Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.
Oh, what do you think? I found it at the back of my closet.
I thought it was open to the public.
I don't know  he's got some valuable antiques, He's worried they'll break something.
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.
Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.
I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.
Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met!
No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!
No, look, you don't understand. I, I want the picture.
Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?
So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?
Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.
The main thing is to keep the line moving.
No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.
Oh, you want to try the syrup! (Meryl smiles and takes it. The waitress comes over.)
An inch! Can you move over an inch?!?
Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone)
Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get in touch with you.
I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.
First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.
(animated) Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and you sold a Cadillac?!
Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention, Elaine laughs) Maybe it's time you got a different hobby.
Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.
No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?
Well, I dont really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.
(picking up his bag and coat) Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?
I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.
(TO GEORGE) Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?
I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.
(putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to Sopie's) Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship.
Understand you had a little talk with him too.
I cant blame you. I cant believe she never called you back.
He's been sleeping a lot. He's still groggy.
oh I though you didn't care about his looks
The fabric of society is very complex George.
Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason.
So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't?
Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.
Kramer there's no way you stick to this.
(tapping the spatula while waiting for waffles to be done) Any second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready.
Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.
I'll tell you, that There for you crap was a stroke of genius.
Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe well get together.
Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.
All I said was I liked the pen!
(pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?
I think I may have made a big mistake.
Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese. (buys a newspaper out of a machine)
See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.
(TO GEORGE, REWOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?
No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.
Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!
Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.
(Interrupts) Excuse me...Excuse me... Are you asking him out ?
She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator...
What? (to George) What did, what did you say?
You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!
So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did?
Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....
I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I dont know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because its really not a definite thing yet. (crowd cheers him on to tell them) Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that Ive received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. (audience applauds) Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didnt even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, thats what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, You may have already won. Id like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, You have definitely lost! You turn it over, giant printing, Not even close! You open it up, theres this whole letter of explanation, Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest.
Ah, I should have got the egg white omelet.
No. I think it's Demi. (the "i" sounds like an "e")
So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
(standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. (indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.
So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George?
(Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My, isn't this an awkward moment?
So she tought I did it to get back at her
Go outside and see if he's still there.
Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)
I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
AH. Yes that's gonna make a big difference.
(Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.
Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?
See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.
(Joking about the bra-less wonder) Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.
C'mon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine)
uh, well I can't help you there (weakly).
(sarcasm) Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.
I'm not paying for anything until I get that back.
I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.
You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?
Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity.
My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? (to the intercom)
Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you.
Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)
Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.
I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them are doing her dance as they go)
Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for?
(Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off George, and puts it back on his bed)
(bewildered) Why would she try and kill you?
Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice.
Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.
Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.
You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?
No, I told you I admire your hearing.
(cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You havent been out of the building in ten years!
If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like Lex Luthor.
More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.
Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting. I'd have to get new friends. I'd have to get orgy friends. ... Naw, I'm not ready for it.
First of all, I made plans with Elaine.
You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?
'51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?
Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 1130.
You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.
Coach to India - The only way to go.
Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other?
Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.
The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper!
Yknow I think that even if youve had a relationship with someone, or lets say, especially if youve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, its very difficult. Isnt this? Its hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. Its like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, Look, a rabbit. The other goes, So? I believe this is your card. Look, why dont we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?
I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation. The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?"
And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya?
You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...
I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)
Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus.
I got one problem. Youre keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that shes coming.
Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!
I don't know, but we don't have much time.
The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.
Hey, get out of here...hey officer, he's fooling around back here.
(reading) 'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie, hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'
Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions.
Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks.
Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.
(Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!
You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.
Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.
(Pointing) I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.
And who is on the show? Who are the characters?
He was in the shop. I thought you told me he wasn't going to be there.
I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)
You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. (Picks up the phone.) She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...
Theres nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.
What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you.
Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!
No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.
Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.
(Handing her a small bottle) Here, drink this.
It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.
By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine)
A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in The Blob.
Uh, THANKS! This is FUN! Yeah, this turned out to be a GREAT weekend.
Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a, its a little crumpled.
Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.
(livid) Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one!
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little...
What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to Kramers door) Ah hah.
Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!
That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen -
Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?
That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.
Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.
Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years.
(Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did!
I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back.
Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?
No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage?
No good. Too many people know the combination.
Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.
No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.
Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.
That's it! No more questions! I don't care!
(Sarcastic) Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.
(referring to George's outfit) And what mood is this.
Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em.
Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.
It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?
Does it ever bother you that this organization-
Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?
We make all these plans - this idiot goes a hundred miles an hour - the whole weekend's over - incredible - just like that -
I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
What did you have to give your TV away to George for?
I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.
You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!
Yes, come on! How often do you get engaged? Come on!
Could you excuse me one second? Im sorry.
I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and Ill just make up some excuse why I cant go to the game either.
(picking up the phone and dialing) It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.
Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?
Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.
Nah, I dont go for these non-refundable deals. I cant commit to a woman. Im not going to commit to an airline.
Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.
(Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.
You are. I can't get that thing in my car. (referring to George)
And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.
I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!
What are you talking about? It's my car. Let me pay for the gas.
And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.
I once got Happy New Yeared in March.
Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.
Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.
Yeah, big missing goin' on (spreads arms wide)
You know, instead, Im like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.
It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.
Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...yknow, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, its dark, theres bubbles happening, theyre all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, Cmon babe, lets go. You come by, you open up the lid and theyll- (stiffens up, as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, theyre in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, Tomorrow, the dryer, Im goin. You wait here! The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you dont see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So theyre showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isnt your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first.
Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!
Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.
No, no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts.
Ya, that's the.. last thing you want to see. Well, next to last.
No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.
Listen, Matthew, I-I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do.
Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy. You don't have to mention the bubble boy? I know about the bubble boy. I'm aware of the bubble boy. Why do you keep reminding me about the bubble boy?
What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again.
You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.
Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!
If I like their race, how can that be racist?... Hellooo??... Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!... Yyy-yes, I am calling George... Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!
Excuse me, uh...dentist? You a dentist? (The guy shakes his head. Jerry moves on to another guy.) Dentist? Are you a dentist?
All right, I'll call 911. Think he did it? Could've he done it? Couldn't done it? How could've he done it? Couldn't be? Could it? Hello 911? How are you? I'm sorry it was just a reflex...I know it's an emergency number...it is an emergency...my friend is being accused of being a smog strangler and I know he didn't do it...they're putting me trough to the detective in charge of the investigation...what is my name? Who am I? I'm eh...George Costanza...
So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else in real estate?
I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.
'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off the table.
You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.
It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?
Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. It'll crush him.
So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?
George is pickin' us up at the airport.
Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.
He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.
(as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people.
(Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!
Oh, no, no, no, wait a second, wait a second th-th-that--
SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya! (the inter- com buzzes) Yeah?
Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened. (listens) Well, I think you should. Okay, bye.
But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?
I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. Shes going to move in.
You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it)
Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!
Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)
Make sure you get this area here, where he needs the help....
Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.
I bought you a Cadillac. (hands over the keys) Here you go.
(to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?
(checking his watch) I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the "Astonishing Tales of Costanza".
Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.
Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income.
Im takin it, Im takin the place. Im gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. Im livin here...Im movin.
You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder?
(Resisting) Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I-I can't wear this!
Flinched? I did not flinch. George, did I flinch?
I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.
Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?
The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.
So, tell me anyway. Who was the BIG mastermind?
Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.
What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in it's path.
Yeah, Im sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.
But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.
Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?
You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me.
I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing.
Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?
Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.
That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no--
Aaa. Well ... you want something to eat, don't you?
Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.
Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there?
...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.
I dont know. He said hed call back.
Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- Zip, I'm gone. (makes a running motion with both arms and his right foot)
Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!
Okay. I'll get it. (Goes into the bedroom.)
Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job.
Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, its with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I mightve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.
Yeah.. When he's dead he'll be relieved... Oh by the way Viking Press sent a Fedex for you to my parents. They brought it with 'em.
I am not gonna taste your peach. I ate some one's pecan last night, I'm not gonna eat your peach.
The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke. (The phone rings.) Thats probably Uncle Leo.
Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back
Seth! Wow what has it been like five years?
Ma, I told you, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan... Okay, bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Rava) My mother. She forgot how to make French toast. You know how mothers are.
Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!
She likes him I mean she really likes him.
I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how theyre going to look at a thing like this.
Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight. In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.
Let me in, it's me. (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the dressing room) Here. You don't know what this is costing me. (hands Kramer the ticket)
(Kramer shows Jerry and Elaine the paper) "Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research".." Government funds genetic research at area hospital" ... Yeah, so?
Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just wanted to pick it up.
I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? (Kramer holds a broken Tony)
Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.
Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.
Sure. (points at booth) How about this one?
No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him.
All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.
So what your genitals are still lined up.
You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.
He was buying quite a load of chicken, almost for two people ...
Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.
Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.
It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go. (to old man that enters) It was GEORGE!
I never heard anybody curse in a toast.
NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye.
Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?
How do you do? (introducing himself) Uh, Jerry Seinfeld.
Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.
Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.
Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?
It's okayit's just a hot dog, (still sobbing) everything is going to be okay.
I cant believe Im gonna do this. (Jerry opens the door and exits the dressing room. He walks over to Bania)
Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.
Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over my side.
Hey, I called you last night, where were you?
Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're puttin' it in my box now.
I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?
Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?
I don't know. I just feel he should call me.
(to himself) Once a week? (to Uncle Leo) So how's Lydia?
Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated.
(Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!
Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.
But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship.
Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.
Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your..
Sample? (under his breath) Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book.
Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.
Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-
Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.
Get in there. (he pushes George in the direction of the restaurant)
No, but ah, seen any good movies lately?
We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.
Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?
Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to give it up.
She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Am I going? It was three nights ago.
(Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.
Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die.
Why would I leave? This is my apartment.
So, um, do you date uh immature men?
Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?
She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.
hey you know it's weird because that voice sounded a little familiar to me
I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!
That puddle! (Kramer sees the puddle and does a double-take.)
wait, where are you going? where are you going?
Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?
See ya. (Jane Leaves; after the door closes Kramer jumps in shock) what's with you?
(TO GEORGE) Hey George, you ever see one?
(walking out) Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody.
Kramer, do you realize what's going on here? Do you know why you're here?
yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas..
Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way.
Elaine got a new number because she died.
We didnt bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.
There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.
Well, I just want you to know I'm there for you. Course now I'm here for you, but when i'm not here for you, i'm there for you.
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me.
Okay, fine. (Jerry takes a coin from his pocket.) This is the official flip. No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and thats it. Agreed?
How could I know she would start to laugh?
Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.
Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out.
(back in booth) He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life.
Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Jerry hugs Kramer, then grabs him by the cheeks.) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think Im in the clear here. Elaines not moving in. I dont have to confront her. She has no idea I never wanted her to move in. Im golden!
What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.
So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show, I waited for you, you never came.
No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman.
So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?
Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!
Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine.
No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture.
Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! (Kramer enters.)
Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested)
No, its okay now, that, that girl is not comin. Uh, I misread the whole thing.
Come on. Something's on your mind. Out with it.
uh uh because then it would be all grown up.
August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress! She never changes! Oh my god. (looking around) She's gotta have hundreds of these dresses.
Just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces Kramer) Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!
Where did you see that? Those are private!!!
Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.
I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.
Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.
Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from ourselves. That's what you said.
It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.
Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''. And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. "Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''.
Oh! Rimsky -- great great book if I may say so sir. I almost read the whole thing.
And where does it end? Then everyones doin it. Its like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, "Dont go there." - Someones gotta take a stand!
That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. Its like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you doing today?
Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.
Yeah, so Joey?s a great lover of the opera
I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.
Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?
You better finish your little caf latte there. They won't let you in with it.
We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.
Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.
All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.
So youre sure youre not still angry about last night?
(tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggage, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangements, but we can't seem to be friends when we sleep together.
That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.
See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.
(re-entering) Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again, are you?
He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, that were manufactured in Korea.
(to Kramer) Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night. (frustrated) Where the hell is that jacket?
Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...
Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
(Joking around) I think it's the stench of death.
I did. Im just curious. Its been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points? (to Vanessa) Its up six points!
Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
I'll go if someone else drives. You going?
Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.
You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.
Ohh ... (takes the ticket and heads for the dressing room)
Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this?
Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup of Decaf. (leaves table)
Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?
I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?
(in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.
That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!
Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome.
I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.
Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage.
This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!
Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've never heard anything like this in my life. Listen to this.
Yknow what? This is not that bad an idea.
She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?
No kidding. (thinking) Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!
(Confirming) An alliance. (They both shake hands and laugh evily) Now get the hell outta here. (Newman leaves)
I know enough not to get on them.
(finishing) The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.
Oh, were meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building.
Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.
So what did you do there all day?
Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?
He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything.
I was kind of um (pauses) making out.
Of course I want to talk about it.
(seeing Elaine enter Monk's) Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body?
Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.
He doesn't even care if a man answers.
(Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.
All right. Come on sit down. It's about to start.
Yknow Im sorry you had to leave so early the other night.
Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?
Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? To me tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. "That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh."
Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!
Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel.
Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else.
Oh, the sisters (he sits at the table)
(To himself) Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over there? It's not like somebody died. It's "Beaches" for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't.
This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...
Well... theres a little bit of a problem.
Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?
Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.
Kramer!? (grabbing Kramer's arm roughly, pulling him back as he's about to knock)
Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.
Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
(ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.
What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?
Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.
Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?
No, no. Still doin the big sweep across.
Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted.
Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.
No you go on ahead, I'll take the bus.
And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.
(applying paste to brush) Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?
Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.
No, no, no, it's... "She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her."
That was our babka. We had that babka!
(pointing to Kramer's hair) You got some suds over here.
In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be?
By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.
Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I'm sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.
(Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.
What do you think the worst part of being blind is?
(leaving) You two keep an eye on each other?
She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.
I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.
I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave.
All right, fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone)
Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that. (stepping over Elaine then George's legs to get to the large blue chair and sits down.)
Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.
Good, going good (scratches chin) And the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty good - not bad - I gotta get out. (scratches chin, nose then covers eyes with hands)
Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.
So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything?
(on phone) Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil.
Look, you can hang out here if you want.
Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?
I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it.
The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.
Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.
(waving the key) You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!
You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS!
Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???
I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.
(Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script?
It's this one here in the back. (Tilts his head back, and knocks Elaine's trophy out the window. A loud hissing sound and commotion is heard from the street below. Everyone runs to the windows to look.)
(still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.
Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.
So you're not gonna come back to New York with us?
Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He couldn't! (listens) Alright, I will. (listens) Okay, bye.
[not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]
Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!
In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.
(Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say "Hi", and I say "Hello".
Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly.
Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?
No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?
(hangs up the phone) Yeah, I really needed that suit.
No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me. She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised what's going on.
I just want a, touch em a little.
Honey, what'd you do with the can opener?
Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?
(George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party?
How would you know? You don't speak Korean.
Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.
My stomach, I , think it was that cookie.
No! [throws her purse back at her] No, I mean, no thank you, nah...
Hey ,You think that Shelly's upset that I made such a big deal about the pecan.
No, I don't wanna see the naked people.
(to Kramer) Hey (snaps fingers) get your stuff, let's get going.
(Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So we're on for later?
Oh! Come on, you told them you're from out-of-town just so you could stay in a hotel room.
Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...(hugs Meryl.) I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!
... if this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this woman to help me I would have killed this man. I would have strangled the life out of him with my bare hands
Listen, Joel, I dont think we should see each other anymore.
Well, what do you think the big holdup is?
'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?
First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did.
I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! No!!! Thank you. (Hangs up.) I don't believe this. They've added Bania to the network showcase and he's going on right after me.
I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?
(Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here.
Yeah. (thinking) That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. (decisive) I'm gonna do it.
He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man that's some tart cider!
I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?
What's going on? You're the man of the hour, That's what's going on.
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.
I suppose if it was on the protg's way to the mentor, they might.
You're not going to open with that, are you?
I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?
(Pointing out) It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for "Avast ye matey" - what the hell does that mean?! "20 degrees off the starboard side - the Spanish Galleon!" - there's no comeback for that!
A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see 'em. Come on, I'm calling! (thumps hand on table) What d'you got!
Of course not, if I did would you have gone?
Hey look ,you know, you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here. You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me.
That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his fathers band. Hed loan it to you.
I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So(throws away belt) thats it!
So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building?
(hands up) I don't want it that way.
If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.
How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?
I would like to propose a toast....Wait a second.. George! George Costanza come in here.
Krame? Sein. What are you doing? Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island. What are your thoughts about taking a ride? You sure? Okay, but don't leave me hanging here. Okay, great. Let me give you directions.
I think that would be a very nice gesture.
Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go.
So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.
Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!
I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship?
They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
Oh, I get it, this is about the button.
Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.
No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe it. I lost him. That stupid idiot. Now what are we going to do?
Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly.
Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon?
Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.
Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad.
Well don't get too comfortable. As soon as Seth gets a real job you two are gong back in that chicken supernova.
They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
(to Mickey) Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?
It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.
Good question. (More to himself than to Elaine) Why are we calling?
(Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.
How am I going to live with myself?!
I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy.
Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.
Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.
Well, at least have some reaction to it.
(Like an Army general) Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys.
Kramer! (We hear Kramer's door slam open and shut. Kramer enters. Jerry comes out of his room.) Hey! Where's all my sneakers?
I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.
It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?
I'm saying "get the hell outta there"! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call, Jean-Paul! A wake-up call!
You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.
Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.
I'll see you tonight. (he's opening his door apartment as Kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe)
Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?
(sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.
Well you might as well look it over.
Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.)
All right. Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot. (hangs up)(to George) Casting tomorrow at NBC. 400. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful. (George looks disappointed)
I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood.
Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer!
The Improv is playing "Rochelle Rochelle" The musical.
No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-
Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.
Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.
Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.
Yes. Hes a doctor. (Elaine starts to leave. ) Wait a second. (Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in Elaines purse.) (to George) What are you doing?
Pull yourself together. Your going in there soldier! That's an order!
No, I think the head does most of the stretching.
We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?
No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.
Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--
Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people?
Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere.
Let me tell you something Babu. You go back in that kitchen -- tell your chef I want the works.
[with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?!
A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions) Ho, ho, ho.
(noticing Alec Berg walk in, whispers) Hey, Alec!
(answering) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Um, its for you.
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world He's Boring.
That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it. (throws watch in garbage)
She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.
Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?!
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?
You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!
But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment shes going right for that machine.
Id rather not say it out loud. Its embarrassing.
You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.
I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad?
(to waitress) I' ll just have a cup of coffee.
Good. And Ill tell you what... You dont have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.
Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.
How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!
So you want to catch a movie later?
Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.
I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.
Oh yeah. He's good. You know he's John Ritter's cousin.
Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand and put it on his shoulder)
I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.
Well, your day's getting more interesting already. (Jerry shows the phone) Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.
Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?
Anyway, I don't need your help. (Turns to leave.)
And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!
Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.
Are you nuts? You dont even know the guy.
Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over this whole operation!
(A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.
I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.
Hey, ??? is rerunning the Yankee game. You watching this?
You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.
But then I found out about the skin cancer.
It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?
(Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.
Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.
"Yeah!!! What is that? I mean isn't that sick. I mean , I'd be embarrassed to have that in my apartment."
Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!
Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--
It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.
I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? "Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!"
This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.
Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.
So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--
Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.
Jenna's like me. She's very... (searches for word)
Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?
Wait a second. (Grabs the icebucket off the counter.) This'll scare 'em off. (Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. Jerry gets back into bed.) Well, good night, Ollie.
(Trying to get rid of her) Yes, I think it's a fine idea. Well, good night.
Yes it is. I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior.
(Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.
I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for him for a second.
I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.
Yeah. a-hu. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?
40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?
What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!
It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.
She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was "Beaches" for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?
If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.
We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? (turns to George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George?
Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time.
(on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel! (hangs up the phone very disappointed)
So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?
We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.
So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.
Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.
So you lie! What did you tell her?
(Stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. (Approaches the intercom) C'mon, let's get it together.. (Through intercom) Yeah?
Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.
There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...
Listen to this "I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."
It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.
I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.
You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..
(seeing that Kramer has a new watch) What's that?
First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.
Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here!
she's one of these people, always have to be different
What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage death match.
Yeah, let me just stop by the cash machine and I'll meet you over at the coffee shop.
We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.
Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.
All right, sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) George?
Ah, you know. Im supposed to meet, eh, someone -- Ill, Ill wait for them outside. (walks towards the door)
Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
There you go. That'll get you home in time.
(under his breath) Well, this worked out just as I had hoped.
I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, "Oh This is so good. What's in it?" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not.
Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. (They both walk to the booth and sit down. Suddenly, Gwen is attractive) Now this is a good looking booth.
Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.
(Scolding) George. (To salesman) Sorry, were just waiting for David Puddy.
Ive been thinking about asking this girl Im, uh, seeing-
I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.
Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.
You know, I don't even know my IQ.
No, I tried it on. It fits good.
Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?
Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too.
(Being frank) Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.
We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.
Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, that's it. They go to the next show.
The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves)
I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?
I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something.
Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.
I love the day date. No wine, No shower.
You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake.
And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?
(to the phone) Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my moneys gone... Well, call me right back. (Jerry hangs up.) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasnt been home or in his office in the past three days!
Um, who do I make it out to?
I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.
A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?
(to George) That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.
Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?
Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.
Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.
You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while, no matter how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because they're crawling , crawling on your skin. Up your legs , up your spine , up your back.....
I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.
Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers?
What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy?
By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?
So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.
Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?
Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)
Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined.
Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.
(On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.
It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.
Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!
Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.
That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.
Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?
I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I cant imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but thats me. Alright
I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...
What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him?
How could you leave a message like that on my machine.?
(Reasoning) You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place!
What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with. [To attendant] What is going on?
No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.
No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's.
to himself Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.
You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now.
Come on up . (looks at his watch) ...What's he doing here now?
I mean it's no big deal. You're still drivin'. You should have been watching the road.
(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
Hey, hey. uh Pamelas birthday party, didnt I see you there? Jerry.
I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.
So it had nothing to do with you.
If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.
So you don't cry when your grandmother dies? But a hotdog makes you lose control?
A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?
(smugly, under-his-breath) Not only that, I broke his thumbs.
We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk.
Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father.
No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.
I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.
You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.
It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.
Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before. Your hook is too small. This is for, like, a muffin. All right. Take it away.
You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go... up.
George used up all my guest passes already.
Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin?
Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?
And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.
Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a little. .
I gotta talk to her. What do you think?
When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion.
Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.
No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.
Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.
We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing.
It's like Im talking to my Aunt Sylvia here.
You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!
Yeah, Ill have the egg salad on whole wheat.
Oh my God is that the new perfume?
So forget about the books. Did you read them?
Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves)
No body said youre fat. Hes a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy.
Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.
Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again)
(Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.
Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?
Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.
Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her Im sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.
What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up.
That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
(like a frustrated child) Why can't I know?
See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.
(thinking) Whats going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, shes too good to be alone. Whats the difference, I cant maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me.
And you didnt even hear how she sounded.
I was hoping you'd offer. (The intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!
And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.
No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.
Yeah, but how could you be so sure?
So I dont know what shes using it for.
So, where do you want to eat tonight?
You didn't like that crack about the pen.
I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel.
(looking at the cop) What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think he's getting coffee.!
You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.
Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!
You see , I kept up my end of the pact.
I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.
Doesnt think anyone can tell. So cmon, do we have a deal?
All right, Elaine but this is beyond news. This is like Pearl Harbor. Or the Kennedy assassination. It's like not even news. It's total shock.
Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?
Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania)
Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.
Alright, but let me ask you this question.
There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that...
(worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!
All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter)
No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!
(adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.
The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.
Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?
So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?
It's been known to happen....... telling you right now Elaine, this guy 's gonna dangle that dress in front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule.
Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya doing?
So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out (as mortician) 'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'. (as Mrs Costanza, horrified) Aahh!
Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thingreal bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though.
I really have to go to the bathroom.
Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway.
Uh, I don't know, we used to go out.
I don't know, but you better keep it up.
That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.
You promise you'll never come in here again?
Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.
Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up)
No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.
She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.
Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.
...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.
Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be? (Elaine laughs - hu) Why can't you live?
You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.
Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing...
Ow. Stupid fold-out! Why'd they put the bar in the middle of the bed?
I dont know, I don't feel so good.
Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to begin with! Let's face it. I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's that!
Never. (The elevator door opens.) Wait a second. Thats her. On the right.
Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll never get another date with her. She'll freak out.
I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?
All right, I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else.
Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?
Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to an open box) isn't that one of yours?
You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.
(as Kristin is storming out) Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?
Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy.
Turn up the heat in your apartment! (opens a window)
Hey. It's you! (pointing) Th..that's my Friars Club jacket!
"I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery."
I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect.
Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)
I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway.
You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?
I thought you were gonna watch a video.
All the time. Ive been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I cant live like this. I dont know what Im gonna do. Im heading for breakdown! (to Harold) Cant you do something?
I dont return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.
Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.
Oh, shes really great. I mean, shes got like a real warmth about her and shes really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better.
All right, forget it, forget it. Im not taking the place!
When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.
(on phone)Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.... it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye.
Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.
Not that I would think of doing such things.
You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for?
I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.
Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.
Of course I was getting you a note.
(bored) Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it.
I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.
(watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans?
Well what about me! If you're going like that, I?m not going like this.
I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?
I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that couldn't be.
You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about the Costanzas'
'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'.
Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.
Aww, right. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it!
Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. (Elaine smiles and rolls her eyes at him) What brings you here?
(Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.
Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying "mickey"!
Look Ramon, about the other day. Im sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway.
Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)
You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.
Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door.
Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit?
Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. Weve been doing this silly, dumb voice.
Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.
I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? Thats what I want to know. I mean, its the championship, Im hitting everything.
I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!
Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.
No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?
...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana...
(thinking) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft... (to Vanessa) Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit.
No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.
By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks.
Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.
Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.)
Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read. I was wondering if-
Oh! I got a message. (presses button on answer machine)
(Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.
Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.
Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.
Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?
Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.
Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?
All fathers are intimidating. Theyre intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, To hell with the world, I can make my own people. Ill eat whatever I want, Ill wear whatever I want, and Ill create whoever I want.
(defensive) At least it was just the handle!
Alright, sit down, sit down. (Grabs a pill from the bottle, and starts advancing tward Kramer - like an owner with his dog)
I just wanted to say how sorry I was...
Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything. Why don't we all just go to Paris?
(looking at the Wizard) Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents.
There he is. He's going into that bar.
George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long.
God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?
You know I dont get that whole suicide machine. Theres no tall buildings where these people live? They cant wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?
Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person.
What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one.
Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.
No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off.
You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do.
So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?
I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodations. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats.
If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.
Y'know a lot of people have asked that...
You know it and I ditched all my junk food.
Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD.
No don't do this. You're not doing this. I will fight you. No you don't... No.
What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.
I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?
Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on.
Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please leave.
I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?
(to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!
Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?
(He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.
Well, go in there and talk to her. She's not going to put em on the glass.
All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've flown first class, Elaine-- I can't go back to coach. I can't... I won't...
It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.
Yeah, I know. There's no call for that kind of attitude.
I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, "Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me." But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?
(on the phone) Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.
But you did actually throw his coat out the window.
I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...)
(talking to Beth on the phone) Could you put him on, I'd love to say hello.
(to Elaine) Where's Kramer? Shouldn't he be here by now.
So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?
(agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!
You know, Kramer's gonna clean up on this place.
Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.
Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.
No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything off me, first laughs now ladies.
Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?
Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. If you're there it'll be a better group.
I mean, every time I see him, it's Tony this, Tony that. George is like a school girl around him
It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?
Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys.
Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.
Yeah.. how about this I say "How's it goin'?"
What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. "I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other people. You won't be around me. But you will be around." "Take care now." Did you ever say that to somebody? "Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now." "Take care. Take care." What does this mean? "Take off!" Isn't that what you really want to say? "Take off now."
I don't think the network will go for it.
You know last time you had me throwin' a rye bread up three floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off your car, where does it end?!?
You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?
You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.
Whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guyll be like, I dont think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life? And of course the womans looking at the guy, thinking, What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?
Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.
See...women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel...
If I see her, what do I say that Im doing here in the building?
Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain.
Oh and I've got some things of yours here.
Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here.
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!
Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?
That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this?
Well, well, look at you. It?s a little skimpy there isn't it?
Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here.
Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort?
My honest opinion, I think she made it up.
George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, ok...do we know where the 101 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 170 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 134 is? (George just looks at Jerry) No. Aha, ok. (Jerry hangs up) He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up.
Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!
You know, Gary (slams shut the door) I had a little chat with George the other day...
Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.
Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises?
Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me...
(pulling out a tape from his pocket) Vvvvup. Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your feet up?
How many years of med school did you have?
I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
(with a wild expression) Hey, Kramer! I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open!
(flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb.
Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie.
That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up. (phone rings) Excuse me one second.
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--
He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal.
When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.
You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.'
These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86.
Youre gonna get back together, anyway. Its thousands of dollars!
How can I ever have you over? Youll sit there moping.
Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.
Well, we need change and all I have is twenties.
Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.
Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.
Get out of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The Heart Attack')
Oh, o.k. (Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.)
(looking at Kramer's moustache) Uh, we're not doing that anymore.
(Nauseated at the saying) Would you please stop saying that?!
You're meetin' the father for the first time?
But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.
Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?
That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.
Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail.
Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.
Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! Nice job on the circumcision but it's not supposed to be a finger.
Oh yeah, Sfuzi? I- I've gotta do that.
Hum, well it all comes as news to me.
Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.
Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo.
Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.
Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?
All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, "It's been real," move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.
Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.
So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.
There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a "Smell Gestapo". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush...
Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.
Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.
Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
I know nothing, but what did you actually do?
I would know if I had a blender.
(Jokingly playing off Kramer's statement) With a different body.
Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?
So she kicked him out of the apartment.
Oh no! >click click< Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!
Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.
Good idea. (phone's ringing, goes to it) (muttering) There's a beach towel on the rack.. (to phone) Yeah.
Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.
Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--
Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.
Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!
It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it.
Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?
I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?!
Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.
Alright, Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.)
Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.
It's over there. I know where it is.
You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal.
So youre saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, its all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.
Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--
Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know its missing, and he took it! And of all things to take! I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. Hes crazy.
Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.
Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.
Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee.
What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.
Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?
So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box.
It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
I mean, she called me. I havent called her. She started it.
So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist. You just called the woman for a date.
What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at work?!?
Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.
(trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents.
Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh...
(sarcastically) Yeah, Levine. And Im Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.
For crying out loud, He's Superman. (Fulton stops laughing, Jerry's face is stunned) Fulton? (looks at him) Fulton?
Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!
Great. One of the best jobs I ever had.
I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.
I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.
(thinking) Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?
I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?
Alright, alright. Uh, undo them. I'll help you get them off.
The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.
I said pull over by the stop sign.
Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?
Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.
How could you eat fish on a plane?
I *just* learned that. (proudly holding the Yo-Yo)
Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. Shes usually pretty punctual. Dont you find that, George?
Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!
How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?
(to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?
I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.
Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad.
(reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.
Non-fat yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it.
Oh, man, look at this mess! You know what's gonna happen if they see this?
Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?
My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on. (Kramer enters with a bucket and starts filling it with water on the sink) Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.
Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. (Joel shakes his head agreeing; Jerry smiles) You know, its their annual terrorist luncheon.
Let me get a clean pair. (Goes into his room. George strides over to the window.)
Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.
Kramer's Andre, he's fooling around with these 976 numbers (Kramer walks out of the bedroom) hey I told you, I don't want you doing that on my phone
(for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.
Oh I dont know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing.
And she wants to break up with you..
I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.
Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?
Great, you're lonely and miserable again. (presses button to call elevator)
Is that guy still there? (They are side-on to Phil who is in the background, still pressed against the glass, aghast)
No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.
(Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key?
Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)
She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing to George) He likes the pop-in, too.
That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.
Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.
(to the Drake) So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome... (to Elaine) They loved the TV, *loved* it!
I don't know, this? (Shows his neck to Sara.)
Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.
What? (Kramer hands Jerry an envelope) My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it?
Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of?
Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.
I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.
(as George picks up a broken piece of his car) You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out...
"Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old married couple--" *I told you that pear was washed*!
Theres one thing I dont understand. Why does it please you? (to the phone) George Costanza, please.
I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...
That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.
Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything.
I like your nails, that is a great color.
Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. (pretends to pull hair out)
She thinks youre a guy that doesnt like coffee.
The dating world is not a fun world...its a pressure world, its a world of tension, its a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I dont know what they need. I know I dont have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one Im- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, were all human beings, what is the story? Ive never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, Ive never been in a situation, when I thought to myself I could use a cotton-ball right now. I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they dont need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, theyre like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? Theyre huge and two days later, theyre out, theyre gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin with them? The only time I ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, theres two or three, that look like theyve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I dont know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl whos left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I dont know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. Lets move on. The dating world is a world of pressure. Lets face it a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance youll end up naked at the end of it. You know? Well, Bill, the boss thinks youre the man for the position, why dont you strip down and meet some of the people youll be workin with?
Oh, oh take it back. Let's get another one.
Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!
Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.
I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!
Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our prices, we'll give you the store.
No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial.
Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.
Oh, Hey, there's a name you don't forget.
No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble..
Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser.
(Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.
No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out.
(finding Frankie, in his hole) Frankie... come on out of there.
Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.
Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something?
And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.
Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?
Uh huh. Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?
I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
Excuse me.( gets up and opens the door)
Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.
Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! Its a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!
Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.
Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.
So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye.
No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.
Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine.
You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.
He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. (Mimics brushing his teeth) Away from the gums... (The door opens a little, George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and Elaine, then enters.)
You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.
(Giving Newman a sour look) I'm just hanging out in this hell-hole because of George.
All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?
(about the massage)You know I think this is really helping.
I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.
Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?
Good evening, folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--
(Making nothing of it) So? Who cares about that?
It's been three days already, forget about Lupe.
(Shrugs) Oops. (Continues walking along the route, whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street, then keeps walking)
I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.
Boy, It's the way they just slip it in there too.
Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment. How 'bout I make it up to you with dinner?
I dont think so. You know they, theyre so fragile.
I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?
Yeah, okay. (to Elaine) They may have found the car.
Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.
And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.
That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?
No, its not you. Its your stomach, hes taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?
They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record.
(Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.
You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.
I can't go to sleep at nine o clock!
You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?
Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you.
I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.
Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?
No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing.
Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of deadbeats.
Youre movin in, youre a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars. (Elaine is shocked, Jerry opens the door to the hall.) Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I dont even wanna see it, go, get it out.
Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!
Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.
oh look at that I got oil all over me. Can I have your napkin?
So he just shaves his head for no reason?
What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. (Hangs up)
Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here.
Aw! You'll be fine, you were in there for what , a couple of minutes.
Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.
Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.
They sell them by the side of the road. Blueberry, Blackberry ....
(apologetic) Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.
I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg." But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, "Would you mind?!"
Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this jockey and the jockey got off the horse and started chasin' him.
Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?
Come on, take them. You could take Bonnie.
But you were supposed to get me a refund.
It's not one of those 976 calls, is it?
Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.
(playing Scrabble with his naked girlfriend) Zephyr? That is not a word.
(Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?
(Reading it) "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." - What is that?
(to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?
Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives. (Picks up phone and dials) Hello Tim? Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you? Well it turns out I can use them. Oh, you do? I understand. Okay. Bye. He already made plans, he can't change them.
So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new guy, in a big pot of love stew.
Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
(Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.
Elaine, see this T-shirt, six years I've had this T-shirt. It's my best one, I call him Golden Boy.
Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isnt that child abuse?
You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. Hmmm. What do you want?
How come? I told you - It's fantastic.
Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.
I don't know, opera, it?s not my kind of thing.
Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. (Newman considers the implications of this.)
Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?
How do you stop a kid from growing?
I'm not a foodie. I don't, "Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty." Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book. What is this? The story of the bill? "Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.." What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating from the restaurant? What is this about?
I gotta say, thats pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.
I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.
W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.
I dont wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do you think?
Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?
Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters)
They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?
Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday?
Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.
50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.
(beginning to cough and struggle) Getting weak... Losing power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing without me. Nothing!
(in the hallway, hearing the door lock behind him, turns back) Kramer!
So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.
I had a very interesting lunch with GEORGE Costanza today.
(Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not.
They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives.
Hmm, I really need to speak with him.
I don't know. (takes off his sweater) This sweater really itches me. You want it?
I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.
So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.
I can't believe she threw out my napkin.
Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.
So, its okay? I could just tell her she can have it?
Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.
There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.
(interrupting) "Elaine , I really don't...............pay much attention to men`s faces."
and that's why you're going out with him
Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't get any oxygen.
I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.
No, don't stop, Kramer. Keep going, don't let him get away.
Widower? Wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research)
...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're there approving new clothes.....That's a girlfriend job! How dare he!!
(Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.
Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I never know what to write on these things. I hate doin' this.
Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him.
You know my parents are coming in and I got some clean up to do , so if you and Potsie are done scheming....
Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.
(under breath) Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..
She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.
I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.
So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?
This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.
Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles...
Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!
Dont you think she woulda heard I was there?
That's not going to be good for anybody.
How much did you wound up tipping her?
I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to Jack)
So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister...
George, I want you to promise me something. If Im ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.
You picked up on a vibe, from a nun.
"Did you notice he always refer to himself in the third person. Jimmy can dunk. Jimmy's new in town. Jimmy we'll see you later."
I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.
Why'd you have to say anything to her?
Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
(trying to ease the tension) Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends.
Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.
Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?
You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial.
Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on?
Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm alarge.
I'm not letting you cheat, Newman. You're not getting anywhere near that board.
I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.
Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.
Its raining? Its raining. The game will be postponed. Well play tomorrow.
The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting out that marriage.
Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him.
Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.
We dont understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you cant stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I dont see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, lets make up our mind where we think theyre going.
Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally!
What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)
What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?
I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.
(still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.
Look at you, youre still thinking about it. Ill never feel comfortable.
Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case.
So how come you're not going over there for dinner?
Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?
Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.
I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.
Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.
Maybe I didnt want to talk to him.
Um, you know, its the damnedest thing. It went away.
Since when are you treating me to medicine? What are you doing? You're stealing this, aren't you?
Hold it. Broccoli? Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce.
Okay... but theres no cake or anything, if thats what youre looking for.
Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.
What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?
Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!
Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again.
(To George) You're off bread. (To Elaine) So what happened is it over?
John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.
Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?
But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!
Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?
I wonder where Elaine is sitting? I really wanted you to meet her she's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend Tony
Vanessa, thank you. Ive been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.
(accusing) You're not wearing a shirt, are you?
I was. But, shes got me, like, hypnotized.
Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a One-woman show?
I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.
I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.
Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" or, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" You emphasize "Jerry" or "bring."
I cant. Shell get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.
What are you doing? Were going out for dinner in ten minutes.
I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.
Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another mistake.
Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?
Elaine, George (introducing them to Bania with less enthusiasm)
George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.
Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!
No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.
All right. (opens door - Red light floods hallway - a buzzing sound emanates.)
All right, let me ask you this when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?
What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?
Why don't you just get rid of it?
That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?
I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didnt want to talk to, I could go, Excuse me, Im not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away. I also have a cordless phone, but I dont like that as much, because you cant slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone  You cant talk to me like that! Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone  You cant talk to me like that!
Cause Im an idiot! You may think youre an idiot, but with all due respect, Im a much bigger idiot than you are.
Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.
So, Im on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the...
Is that your "chicken" making all that noise?
To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in, in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in "morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? fine" Ten minutes later you see him in the hall, "How ya doin'?" Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow "Hey" You start coming up with nicknames for them. "Jimbo."
Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.
(acting like he was walking on stage) Hey how ya doing? Good to be here.
Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?
I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!
Have you said anything to her about it?
I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.
Well I guess if I?m the Miana I should go. All right, all right.
(Disgusted. To the woman) Oh, come on. You know he's a postman, don't ya?
Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.
All right! Take it easy! Take it easy.
Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now?
Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)
Yeah. What's wrong, why? ( George runs back to the bathroom)
If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, Im telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. Im sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.
You cant have that coat, it's not yours.
Hey buddy. I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's like in there, all night long things are creaking and cracking. And that red light is burning my brain!
So you want to just abolish all home package deliveries.
Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.
Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.
Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?
(putting the phone back to his ear) Yeah.
Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.
Over here. You can see right through here.
And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.
No in a matter of fact it isn't.
Jim Fowler? The animal guy from "Wild Kingdom" is coming to your apartment?
(Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really?
Oh, did you get that outta my bag?
(yell) Move to the back of the drawers!
Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?
Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?
Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?
All right, bye. (to Elaine) You see this? Any thought pops into their head they're calling me because it's a local call now.
I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!
Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer.
Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer!
Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?
I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
I didnt know what the coma etiquette was.
Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.
So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!
All right. As long as youre okay. Because I cant stop thinking about her.
Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that?
September 21st, first day of Autumn. Leaves changing colours.. Beautiful colors.
I have to go over to my grandmother's.
They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.
Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?
(to the phone) Hello? (disappointed) Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) No. Uh, I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesnt know anything. Hes just my next-door neighbor. Uh, nothing much... Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. Im meeting somebody... Uh, Wednesday? Wednesdays okay... All right. Uh, Im a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning?... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone.
Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.
I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.
Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!
Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency.
All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a specimen.
It's like we're living in the '50s here.
Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?
Well, You can't go in there it's like a gas chamber in there.
I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on me.
Well thank you very much, it's about time.
Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck.
Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something.
Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.
Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!
Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail.
Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for membership.
Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.
What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of temperament?
No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.
Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.
(Once again, the audience hears his thoughts) I'm so car sick. I'm gonna vomit!
George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!
(fetching a drink from the fridge) Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.
What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?
[mockingly] "Please hurry". Look at you. Look at what you've become.
Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress.
No, I dont eat dinner. Dinners for suckers.
(Reading words George wrote on his hand) "Matthew, Luke, Paul", what youre cheating on your conversion chest?
I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.
(To Elaine) It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's unconscious.
you know I'd like to hear about this job of yours
Seth, it's me. What's more important than catching up with an old college buddy?
This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!
Plus Im wearing short sleeves, I dont want to expose my tattoos. (Vanessa smiles; thinking) Shes unbelievable!
I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?
Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.
Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.
Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door)
Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.
What happened to your head when you got hit?
Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)
Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight!
They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same.
You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.
Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set.
Oh! my god. What the hell is this? ..... Don't tell me.......Velvet!!!
Oh, no don't say that. You'll jinx me.
To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go "Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch." According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.
So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?
Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! (Kramer exits.)
Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it.?
I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.
Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it?
Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy.
I was an idiot for listening to you!
Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.
(mind's voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?
We're gonna have to talk about this later. (Elaine holds the door open for Jerry while holding her leg) Thank you. Taxi!
Well I started screaming, "There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina." Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running (In the background -- CLERKS VOICE 57) and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.
You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.
No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.
Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee)
He asked me to. We were getting along.
You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem.
Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.
I never should have made up those rules.
So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?
Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.
(to Elaine) Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?
I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.
When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!
Im always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice. Never quite sure, Is this the best lane for me? For my life? Theyre always a little bit ahead of you, Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there? Yeah, come on over here, pal. Were zoomin over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it. The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen? Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday well be going, (Jerry pretends hes driving in reverse.) Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. Im gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.
He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris.
I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.
(To his parents) So? What do you think?
I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.
I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. "The New Yorker is stealing my ideas." ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real.
How's life on the red planet? (shuts door)
I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it.
I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.
Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.
You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner.
Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.
(taking off his jacket) Slaughtered. Wiped the floor with 'em and (hanging up jacket) not only that, the money was unbelievable.
What happened you didn't give her the papers?
That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's.
You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.
Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish...
Ahh, too bad you got a little, George Costanza thing going on.
Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.
How long has your car been sitting in the Yankee parking lot?
But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.
Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?
Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.
I don't know. What if I get caught?
(to Ramon) Oh. Okay. (to Elaine) Wh, what is he doing here?
(looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend.
(Scoffing) Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.
Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?
Look, let me just give you the forty, plus another twenty for your trouble.
So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.
Well there's always a place for you, on our team.
Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?
Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.
(Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.
Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.
If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.
You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here. Mike Wichter. He sold plastic straws. You know the ones? You could bend them.
George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?
Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.
"Hey! Hey! Watch it.!... You're drooling all over the floor. How much Novocaine did that guy give you."
Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this, now she's got nothing.
Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?
Uh, again? (Limping towards the door) I'll be right there.
Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know, we can't go anywhere near there.
George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
(taking a catalog) Can I have one? I need one of those old-looking phones. So you wanna grab a bite?
Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.
Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.
So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry?
Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch?
The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.
No, its not that. It wasnt all one-sided.
Hey come on, you're getting it all over the floor!
Oh, great. Ok we'll goin' away. I think I'm excited.
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?
And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?
All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier. (Elaine drinks straight out of the orange juice container) Hey.
You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift.
(seeing Kramer struggle to open a soda, spilling it all over) I think the damage is probably already done. (interrupting Kramer's inadequate attempt to clean up the soda) All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene.
(to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
(Trying to change the subject away from Nina) Hey - Hey Kramer, what are you doing? You want to borrow something? You want to eat something? Come on in!
How about our little Elaine huh? Attended the finest finishing schools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions. Debutante balls. Look at her now. Interviewing Mohels.
(opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?
(CONT'D) What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.
"Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!"
What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.
Well, once I didnt have dinner until, like 900 oclock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage  meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya? Throw out my garbage for me.
You know I don't even know why I brought you.
What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.
Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together.
What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what they're saying.
Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... what kind of a sicko would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide (small fingers opening imaginary drawers) Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT hard to get round black buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this? ... is it such a great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, you'll never find them - they save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they're going to fall off too that's the other thing ...
Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?
Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what youre talking about, now, come on, come with me. (stands up) I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.
So then as I was getting out of the car, ...
George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say,kookie talk.
(to Elaine) So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?
But you said, it can be very serious.
Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe-- "Jerry Jerry Dingleberry", and-hu "Seinsmelled"...
What do you think the Nazis were doin? (Imitates the Nazis salute) That was the heil-five.
Youre wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!
(Like a little kid) But, I don't want to be a pirate!
No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. Whats important is you two getting back together. Eh, then well talk about the car.
Yeah, uh, Ok, uh, tomorrow uh, where da ya - where do you live, uh, up town? Upper west side?
What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?
It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.
Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.
Well, Im sure you did. Who wouldnt love a pony? Who wouldnt love a person that had a pony?
There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?
So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.
Is there, something I can help you with?
Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?
Oh, really. (Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.)
Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?
Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?
I didnt tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog?
I don't understand. What don't you like about it?
There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.
So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk.
You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West? Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.
(uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.
Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?
Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.
I would like to know what my names doin in this creep's organizer to begin with.
Golden Boys always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry. Here... touch Golden Boy!
That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.
He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication.
Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so fuck(bleeped)ing good.
I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?
Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Caf Latte?
See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. (Elaine laughs.) All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free.
A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?
Im supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?
What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him? 'Cos I asked him about the Knicks?
Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.
(taking out his wallet and handing over bills grudgingly) Fifty dollars.
(realising) Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. It belongs to the Friars Club.
(answering machine) Leave a message. I'll call you back. Thanks.
Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy.
Yeah have a couple of pieces, weak, weak gum yeah
If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.
(to Bania) Excuse me. (he goes back in the dressing room)
(Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven!
Oh right, the new job, how is it?
Well, it couldnt be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?
Ya. (hits the button, opens the door. To Elaine) Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys.
(Over the phone) Elaine, youve got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin me on this car, which is yellow now!
(incredulous) You asked her to move in with you?
Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.
So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh?
That's what I do with him [points at George]
You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it.
You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?
The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?
You told Testikov, (Elaine nods) that Tolstoy wanted to name his book "War-- What Is IT Good For?"?
Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.
I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.
Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.
(eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.
Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I dont feel comfortable in them.
I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.
Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up!
(into the phone, with a disguised voice) So, what's going on?
Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.
Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.
yeah, it's a damn shame, a damn shame!
Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!
(shouting) Kramer what am I going to do did you hear that that guy's gonna put a kibosh on me he's crazy he's out of his mind....
Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) Thats it. Done!
So Marcelino's going to take down the check?
What I said. Ive been under a lot of stress.
Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with you?
Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.
So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?
A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning..
So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?
No, believe me it's not good. I'll mail you a new one with something really funny written on it.
Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car so I don't toss it in that dumpster?
Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.
What is this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesnt fit him).
Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?
I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?
You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.
No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
(advancing on Gary) ...and he told me that that... (becomes indistinct)
(answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.
Oh No, wait a second... Wait a second... I-I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name.
My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin' "where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?"
Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.
But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.
Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore...
Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.
He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!
May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" across the painting)
Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?
I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.
I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I - I don't even remember the name of the town.
Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?
Ah, just remember when you see him tomorrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him.
That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.
(accusingly) Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.
And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
Ah, dinner! Thats it, youre all the way back!
The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.
Hey Doc, check this out. [does an around-the-world with the Yo-Yo]
She wanted to thank us for the apartment.
Well ... ok, I guess (voice trailing off)
Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do?
It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library
What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?
"They get all emotional , they sway. It's embarrassing."
Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful.
Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that?
I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say.
I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.
..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beveridged!
I'm sorry. Got any booze? What's say you and I get ripped!
Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.
He asked you to watch them not wear them.
Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy.
Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.
Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it.
Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?
I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!
"Wait a second ..Where you wearing those shoes in the cab?"
All right. (goes into his hallway and comes back) You got my fins?
No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first.
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?
Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. (Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks at Kramer.)
Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.
Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!
(to George) She thinks it's someone named Raef.
George, we're trying to have a civilization here.
So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought.... And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me.
I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.
(talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass.
I-I-I don't like the opera. What are they singing for? Who sings? You got something to say, say it!
Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.
She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?
So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is better?
Ah, so, ah, flower shows and, shopping for pretty bows, and then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight?
Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.
I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?
(sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand.
Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it.
Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting a package.
(Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after him!
Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go.
My moms down in Florida. Shes got uh one of those condos. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?
Well, would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.)
You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.
Yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder)
(uncertain) Don't you hire people to do that?
You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.
(Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.
The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.
Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.
The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what youre doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? We have soda, we have soda, we have soda, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. Its a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and youre watching TV and youre drinking the exact same product that theyre advertising right there on TV, and its like, you know, theyre spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and Im standing there, Maybe Im putting too much ice in mine.
(continuing to pack) That's a nice four seconds.
Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.
He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly . I would like to have a good show.
Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to 'em. Mind if I walk through real quick?
Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.
Anyway, you know why I didnt ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab.
Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.
You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events.
I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?
(grunting as he throws bread into the air)
Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.
Uh, hang on a second, You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck.
Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm.
Hey, look at the high score--"G.L.C." George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?
What do you care? You don't believe in hell.
Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you.
Yes. I do love her. (to baby) You have a very nice place here.
Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.
You had a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with my butler?
It's a movie stub from the 930 show. George, I think Willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes.
Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions.
Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery.
Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend.
Have you noticed people staring at your head?
How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a minute. Poppy's from Tuscany. I'm gonna go call him.
So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, hes thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, theres nothing left?
I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from.
Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr.
Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. (Kramer goes to get the suit. Elaine enters.)
Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, "Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land." (Imitates cannon operator) "I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you."
I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!
I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?
Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.
Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?
Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?
(doubtful) I don't know, do you have a--
So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club.
That's funny, that's funny! "I'm sick of cleaning." That's very funny.
(Joking around) Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.
(to waiter) Ill have a cranberry juice with two limes.
All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you double what you paid for it.
Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.
No, I don't want that smell in the house.
Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.
(scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.
All right, all right. (trying on the suit jacket)
Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.
Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.
Who's got a tissues? I need more tissues! Look at this thing. It's my phone finger!
Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here.
....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together.
Did you at least get him a card?
All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.
Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. (pointing at the umbrellas) What've you got in a push-button mini.
Come on up. (Jerry presses the second button and opens the apartment door. He walks back to the couch.) Oh, all right, forget it, Im gonna take it with me now... (He picks up the cushions.) Im just gonna pack up the cushions right now...
Kramer, why do you have to (noticing Newman) Hello, Newman.
Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.
Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.
You raise the feet, get blood to the head.
Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.
I'll tell you what happened. We got married.
George, who is that woman in the stripes?
You're out of your mind you know that.
I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I dont get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, Im not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, theyre so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, thats it! Its the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we dont know bout that, we dont know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas weve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! I dont think she likes me. The amazing thing is, that we still get women, dont we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. Thats why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like Where to meet men? Were here, we are everywhere. Were honking our horns to serve you better.
Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... Im sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if...
Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.
See, its never as bad as you imagine.
Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?
Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.
I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that.
Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down. (To Elaine) What?
I'm gonna call the cops. That?s what I?m doing, I?m calling the cops.
My car? You drove it into the swamp!
So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was just wondering if there were houses there to rent.
(as Ping rambles on ) ...S'cuse me (Ping looks up) Kind of an expensive call.
If my father was moving this hed had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (as his father) 'Have you got your end?...Your ends got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your ends got to come down.'
Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.
Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!
Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off.
I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club.
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?
(Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.
Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?
No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.
Wow. Kenny Rogers Roasters. Finally open. Hey, look at the size of that neon chicken on the roof.
Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--
So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.
Thats different. I didnt have feelings for those people. But you, youll backslide
So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)
I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?
Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?
No, absolutely nothing. (They get up to leave) You're fantastic! (They meet up with Kramer and George on the way out) Hey guys!
"Jimmy's got a record. Jimmy's jumping for dollars. Jimmt and George are gonna get rich."
You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy.
They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.
Many times. You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet.
Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.
(into phone) Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. (to George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!
You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...
Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday.
So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.
Alright. (Approaches host) Excuse me, this is your party, right?
No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.
"Guys And Dolls"? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?
You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.
Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?
Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?
Yes, I know youre not gonna do it. Thats why I bet.
I live in New York. (slams the cab door) What the hell happened?
Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.
Well, I got to talk her out of this.
(grimaces and takes the shovel back) I'll dig.
(barring the way) I'm sorry. I-I don't know you.
But I could do that and the music.
So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.
Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.
Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)
George, I didnt sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. Im just going to be honest. Thats all... Yes, Im nervous... Are you listening to me?... Just put some soap on your finger. Itll slide right off... Then try axle grease... (Kramer enters; to the phone) Ill call you back after I talk to her... Bye.
So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?
... as long as one of them is not him.
I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!
Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?
Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. Im sure theyd just as soon give it to you, but youd have to come up with that money.
Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed...
Yes, so people are just dialing it by mistake and getting you.
Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!
I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.
Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.
I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..
I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!
I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.
We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.
I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. (casually leaves)
(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!
All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.
Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.
So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?
Alright, that's it.. (Grabs Kramer, trying to pull him out of the car)
The average person in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.
(Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the 80s, and its still relatable today.
No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?
Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?
Well at least you and I are okay again.
Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, "That's not a bad idea."
Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..
STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this? Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.
(to George) So did you bring the lease? (George takes the lease from his inside pocket and hands it to Jerry.) All right, gee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time.
Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!
Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!
That was a one in a million Mohel.
Why dont you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps.) Whats wrong?
Oh. like they wouldn't have found that anyway.
Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.
Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse "ha's." You know those?
All right take it easy, just take it easy.
If you need more time, you should have more time.
Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved.
(pointedly) Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars.
No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I dont know her name.
Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?
"Don't you see what's happened, he couldn't talk , he's wearing these shoes, he's drooling."
Oh, about the... uh (Jerry pretend to wash his hands)
(Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! A dinosaur!
(sound of gunfire) Pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, Pkeeew!
(pointing toward the guy) See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.
George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!
Someone says, Get out of my life, and that doesnt affect your appetite?
So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day?
Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?
Well, uh, I uh, I dont want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe its not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.
Yeah. (Kramer sits in the seat next to Jerry) Uh, uh, oh, oh, Over there. (points to the next seat over)
Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read.
No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.
(Nodding, trying it out) "I'm there for you."
We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men.
Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?
I thought you said you were a good driver!
That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?
We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.
Oh. (notices a car being jacked up by a tow truck) Hey, isn't this Kramer's car? (yelling up) Hey, Cosmo!! They're towing your car!!
I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?
Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.
Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up?
Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!
Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.
You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.
Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?
No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy.
Hello is this Alicia? .This is Jerry Seinfeld.
They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?
George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?
What if she's got no interest in you?
Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
All right, all right. All right, thats enough! Lets get back to my deal. That undercoating, thats a rip-off, isnt it, David?
Do you know what this is all about? Do you know, why were here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about We should go out? This is what theyre talking about...this whole thing, were all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, were all out! There are people tryin to find us, they dont know where we are. (on an imaginary phone) Did you ring?, I cant find him. Where did he go? He didnt tell me where he was going. He must have gone out. You wanna go out you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...Then youre standing around, whatta you do? You go We gotta be getting back. Once youre out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, its my feeling, youve gotta go.
(on phone) But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.
He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.
I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.
No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.
Yeah... hes specializing in whales. He's working on lowering the cholesterol level, in whales all that blubber -- quite unhealthy. You know its the largest mammal on earth but as George says "they don't have to be."
Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.
Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.
See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think?
(yelling) Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.
No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.
She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.
Why didn't you just ask her for it?
Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches)
Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- Ill be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too.
An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. (Elevator doors open) Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. (Everyone but Jerry is now in the elevator. Jerry's still addressing them) Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?! (Elevator doors shut. A few people in the hallway are looking at him, he turns and addresses them) I am not an animal!
Actually it's being taken care of right now.
We won. Were in the finals on Wednesday.
All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.
What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.
Okay. (closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self) Didn't come true.
(After seeing how much his parents like her) Now, I'm not so sure.
Of course, I stink, you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks..
(disoriented) How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?
Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
Whats the difference?! Thats the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!
Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?
You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?
Well , as I said this type of thing is very common in show business
Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!
Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.
Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them.
Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on.
Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift. I know, it's a label maker. The Label Baby Junior. Yeah, I hear they're good. Well, label me thankful. Okay, well you enjoy those tickets. Buh-bye.
Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.
I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.
I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?
Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do?
What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying...
I thought youre like Hitler in the bunker?
(pause, to Donna) You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name...
No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.
Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?
Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.
Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.
Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men.
Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.
Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?
Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips.
I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.
Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?
Why do I have to go on the tour?
I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. "Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life." Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, "I had a heart attack this big (Holds out hands, gesturing bigness) ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear! (Puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest) Brrhht.. and it's gone!"
Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.
Well, we fight a lot for some reason.
Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?
Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
I think theres a mental hospital near here.
Yes. I do. You show me where there's a can opener in that drawer. (Answers the phone.) Hello! I'm sorry, I'm just fighting with my wife.
. . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?
(tucking in his shirt) Oh ya this is Rachel.
Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.
Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.
No, go ahead. Look at this place. I cant wait to get it cleaned.
You know, if your future was a little more certain..
I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.
(Arms out, complaining) I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!
Elaine, you cannot judge a person on a situation like that. I mean it's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert
Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.
No, hes It. He wins. It is good.
Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.
People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.
Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?
Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.
I don't even think you could do it.
Let's check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil.
I could tell you what I did, but you wouldnt believe it. Its not believable.
Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?
Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...
So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?
Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house  and then I saw it in your house.
Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket.
And I don't want you to hold mine!
Look, youre a nice guy, its just that... we dont have anything in common.
Why can't you do this on your table?
All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.
Well it's been quite a night I could sure use a cup of coffee.
(Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.
Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though.
Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you.
What, you got a problem with the pen now?
Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days!
What you must understand, Elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) Youve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.
Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...
So you want to go to the party on Friday night?
For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.
No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter (pauses) Oh no!
Id really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.
Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going "boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly."
I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! **
I mean I met her three times. I dont even know her last name.
I've hardly been out to dinner with them.
Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
"No ,Elaine and I we're just discussing whether I could admit a man is attractive."
Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)
Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. (opens the fridge and gets a bottle of water.)
All right, but you have to go now.
Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!
I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.
So know every time you get dressed. You are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.
To the Paul Simon concert in the park!
Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about it!
Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that?
You're cut off, you're out of the loop!
You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there.
H-Hey, Kramer, wait up. I'll go with you.
Kind of in the middle of something here, George.
You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?
(To cashier) I'd like to speak with the manager, please.
I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.
He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.
(ranting) I can't believe how a little thing like George going too fast - and my whole weekend is gone - the plans, the packing, ... everything.
I'm not sure, but I think she was nice. (takes a sip of water)
So what's going on with Simon? Did he leave?
I cant. Im on my way out. Theres no way I can do it.
Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by the big showcase tonight.
Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*!
Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?
(reluctant) Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too.
hunky.. Tony.. hey hey hey (fools around with his collar again)
Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.)
I still don't know what the idea is.
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why dont you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin anything?
You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.
It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.
[To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.
We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it?
Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it.
Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it!
The crook has the machine. The messages arent for him. Hes the crook. Why would he answer- (Jerry gives up on the explanation and turns around to see George standing behind him.) How did you get in here?
So I can see her tonight, and you dont care?
Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.
I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide.
I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?
(shaking his head no) No Kramer I don't want to talk to him.
Really? (They start to make out, Jerry sees the pilot on the plane) Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!
Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.
Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the sirens song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.
Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me?
Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.
Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test?
I'll see you later. (he leaves with unseemly haste)
Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the check to Elaine) look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.
Aah, top of the fridge. Hey George, I'm taking that waitress to the Tony's.
(also wearing a moustache) What do you mean, 'what is it?' It's a country right next to Belgium.
Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat...
Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner?
I think he's the same age as the father.
Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.
How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it.
I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?
I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.
Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room, searching for the TV.) ELAINE!
Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.
Well, theyre three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.
Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it They're roommates. She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back. She's not gonna do that.
(in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.
I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.
Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.
oh.. uh.. you know your breath is a little garlicky you better take some gum.
Yeah , she's coming to see my act tonight.
Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease?
Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show.
Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.
You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 950, I'm not gonna be able to make it!
Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.
I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...
I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need "the clown" in his title, as clown? Bozo, "the" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?
(While looking at posters of women wearing glasses) I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.
Oh. No. What, you mean because of the "Chang"?
We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, hey maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!?
I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.
No more crutches, that must be a relief.
I have no patience for lactose. And I wont stand for it. Um, Ill be right back.
No, it's a nine-hundred S. (happy) It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo!
Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you do likewise.
I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are gonna be so sorry!
Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump across.
Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)
Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that.
What the hell he's supposed to be on medication I don't understand he told me he's getting medication what happened to his medication!?
I don't know how long this is gonna last.
Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy.
Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?
But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.
What is it she think you can't do?
Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.
Kramer, they're fumigating. There's toxic gas in there.
You know, I think I'll just take the check.
Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man.
I dont give out bites. I got another one. But Im saving it for later.
No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.
(getting worked up) I don't need the money.
In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.
Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?
I know exactly whats gonna happen tonight. Im gonna try and act like Im not impressed, hes gonna see right through it.
What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang"...
Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. (The door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
(dialing) He got em out of the house.
Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)
Dont worry. (whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!... Its Jerry!... Jerry!... From next door!... Never mind where I am!... Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!...
So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table
I'd be very interested in something like that.
I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special treatment.
Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.
No, but wait, wait And then you dump them off onto Kramer..
oh uh nothing, she just.. choked on a jujube
Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.
This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.
Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.
Quone? No, Im afraid that Im going to have to challenge that.
By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?
What you do say about a guy like this, huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. But your loyalty is beyond question.
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!
Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio.
Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it.
Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city.
What are you talkin about? Its fine, I love having you here.
Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie "Cinderfella". I got 'em at an auction.
[forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell out of here!
She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.
By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
So why don't you leave it at Newman's?
So when somebody has B.O., the "O" usually stays with the "B". Once the "B" leaves, the "O" goes with it.
...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either.
I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. (Picks up the phone and dials.)
I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!
We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! Well be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life.
I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work.
Well what am I supposed to do now?
Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.
Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!
I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.
Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. He's a punk, a patsy, a hack.
I got your message, (sitting) so I came straight from Atlantic City.
Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!
(thinking) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume...
Not our "all the way", their "all the way." I got the stink of responsibility on me.
Come on, Go in, go in! [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again]
All right, forget it, its over, Im not moving.
Hey, when Im driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. Im always waving everybody in. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. ...All right. All right. Ill have a chicken salad.
Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?
George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman!
Don't feel right? What are you talking about?
(Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.
(stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored)
Look, its a very awkward situation. I dont wanna be presumptuous.
Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!
U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you?
So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.
Hell have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
No eight years isn't such a long streak.
Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of lobster)
yeah without a doubt, I'm down (Kramer enters) oh hey how're you doing? Jane this is my neighbor Kramer
All I said was "I like the pen".
Revenge date? That sound like you more than me.
I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.
Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom.
It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...
The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.
Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.
Well, I brought them up there to take his records--
(pause) I don't know, they just tell you the night before.
It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.
I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.
(pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you lay it out on the bed.
You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.
So Kramer, what are you going to do?
(suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.
(as Kramer walks by) You're a master of race relations.
Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...
Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off that sign?
Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them.
Come on. Then you dont have to see him again til my 15,000-mile check.
No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.
Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.)
I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a riot.
Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
Aw.. right, code of silence.. how's that going?....Ha!!...
(very disinterested) Hum... ok, what else you got?
I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.
Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count on me! (hangs up)
Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.
(pulling Leo back in) Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you.
Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?
(motions of making out) Well you were involved in some sort of amorous...
So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.
Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?
(Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing?
What could possess anyone to throw a party? I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.
(Smiling, like a salesman) All right. Now, what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today?
You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.
Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.
No. So, we're still on to see uh, Firestorm tonight?
That is a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. Some guy from NBC saw my set, he wants me to do a showcase. I might have another shot at a pilot.
We cold play Sorry! We cold play Steal the Old Mans Bundle. (Vanessa not amused; Jerry thinking) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to Vanessa) What kind of perfume is that youre wearing?
You wanna go with me up to (clap) the Bronx and see if there's any flyers on George's car.
I don't know. So what's this job of yours?
(fidgets like he has no room with George next to him)... Could you move over there?!
Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal [and, ala Carson] Wild, Wild, Stuff...
So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.
So lemme get this straight you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an clair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, "What the hell, I'll just eat some trash."
Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!
So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?
I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.
I think what he's trying to say is, "get the bouilla-base." (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)
Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet?
Well, we've got to do something. (grabs his phone) I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.
Yea, ya, so...anyway what was I talking about.
Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss.
Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!
Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.
No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1,900 dollars.
He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.
(writing) Here's my address and number. And really, thanks again.
Where did you come up with all that stuff?
Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go?
Why, you don't think it's a good job?
You don't think she's just talking to me?
(aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!
Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!
I don't need a reason to give gifts, it's my nature. I love to make people happy.
She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. [sarcastically] I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... >click click< Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? >click click< I'm back...
Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So...
No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.
Leo's furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at George's book) What is that doing on the table?
You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!
Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.
Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.
Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.
Hey, could you do me a favour? [pause] Could you shut-up?
Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?
Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.
What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods.) Did he tell you whats gonna happen? (George shakes his head.) How long were you there?
..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Packyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of (wipes his brow) pizza and uh the uh and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling em (does juggling motions) he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. (Swallows and takes a breath) Well we all just lost it. (Fulton not laughing, stone faced) It was really really funny.
No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.
No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.
How do you know she's not my wife?
I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!
(consternation) Oh no. (to the bedridden two) It's go time.
The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go "Excuse me, I think you missed a spot."
Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.
Don't look at him. (Phil starts to knock on the door)
Well, I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.
That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?
No, no. It-It's really funny. There's these two guys-
Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.
(Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining room doorway) I think the busboy's in trouble.
Lean your head back. Open your mouth! (Grabs Kramer's head) Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!
Who do you know? He knows my hair.
What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.
So, she got you to join a book club?
(through gritted teeth) Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.
(to Kramer) Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot.
I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.
Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,
I just thought ahh maybe I could talk to Roy, if um
Would you excuse me a minute? Im gonna go to the bathroom. Ill be right back.
Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...
(To George) You're givin' him back that TV.
"I don't know but I was spitting out and rinsing like there was no tomorrow."
(sharp) I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.
Oh, no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down. (George & Jerry each slide to the end of their booth seats)
This is Outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit.
Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?
I thought you just said she doesn't know??
You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. (with a British accent) "Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you".
Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.
Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.
I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight.
You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't destroy someone else's.
Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Yea nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?
I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton.
Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one.
She's the model I met on the plane.
You see the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around, but they don't know they're ugly, because nobody actually tells them.
Why don't you put it in the *bank*?
Are saying you're banning me from the store?
What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?
Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.
Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners.
(extemporising) Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was registered under Slappy White.
(giving him a steak from the fridge) Here ya go.
Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.
If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!
Im not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want.
Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And Ill need that in the form of a question.
Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.
I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.
You know what? That was the amazing thing.
The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.
Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket?
Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?
Hey is the same thing as hello. What do you think Jeannie.
Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?
So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?
Fluff and Fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.
Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. (They go out into the hallway and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.) Hey, how ya doin.'
(Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.
Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.
Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you?
Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.
I really think you're making too much of this.
Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?
He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?
So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.
All right. You know this girl Clare I am seeing?
What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha ha!
You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world "I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable." (George is baffled)
What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
It's stuck. (pained) Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood.
Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.
Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.) You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?
(picks up the phone on the coffee table) 555-3455. Well wait a second, don't you see that's 555-FILK.
Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...
So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth? (Elaine laughs silently)
It has nothing to do with whose house it is.
You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldnt expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.
Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?
No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.
No social reason for them to be here.
Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it.
Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.
Elaine is having a "houseguest." She's picking him up at the airport tonight.
Shake is bad, but what if its the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?
Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out...
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye. (Hangs up) Hey, I'm flyin' first class.
Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.
Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both killed!
Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. (George laughs) So, when do you move into the apartment?
Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.
Fasten your seat belts. we're goin' to see the baby.
You should always carry a pad and pen.
I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.
Really? Did you hear that? Somebody else was killed!
Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.
That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.
Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!
So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!" So he says to me, "What are ya gonna do about it?"
Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?
Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?
What do you mean not going? why not?
They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.
Elaine its her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back.
Because you know we used to go out.
Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.
So what are calling me six times a day?
O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!
I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.
Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order)
Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!
Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.
It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look (searches for word) stupid. (to salesman) I'm sorry.
Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in big, big trouble.
You cant go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.
Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?
Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.
No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.
Alright.. (Heads for the door, grabbing his coat)
But you yada yada'd over the best part.
(turning to Kramer) That's nice for the freaks.
Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?
I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.
Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?
I just got the most bizarre message from you father, Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!
I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.
Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car!
Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?
I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.
Well, I-I-I told my wife not to bring it.
I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.
No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver.
Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?
They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.
(looking behind the counter) Hey, is that Babu? It is! (walking over) Hey, Babu!
Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?
Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.)
No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)
Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner
(Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to look, but Jerry stops her) I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs.
So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!
I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?
He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.
I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? (Kramer comes in) A real dermatologist.
You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is! I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, someone asks me which way is Israel, I don't fly off the handle.
Oh, The Muted Heart. Glen Close. Sally Field. Well, that should be good.
(re the underwear pile) Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
(pointing at Georges shirt) See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. Its too high! Its in no-mans-land. You look like you live with your mother.
[whispering] No, no news. You better get out of here.
I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.
I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life.
Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this.
Pull over? The lieutenant is waiting to see us.
Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing?
I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race.
Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.
And youre sure the floss was the catalyst?
...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.
C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!
I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?
(to Elaine) I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog. (to George) Get this one "I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest".
Im just gonna get my jacket, Ill meet you downstairs. Whats the matter, did you call?
All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm away, gets phone) now... the failsafe. The wake-up guy... (dials)
He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them
(reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.
Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.
Oh, its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.
You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool.
So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.
No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, (has his one hand up and his other hand down) he was down. Now he's up, (switches the positioning of his hands) you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?
Oh, I cant believe it. Let me see that. (Jerry takes the paper.) Thats four and a half points in three days! Thats almost half my money!
I dont know. Theyve been in there since, like, World War II. The rents three hundred a month.
Listen, uh I just remembered... Im... uh, getting a facial.
I sure do miss my apartment. Maybe I'll switch back.
What if he doesn't call now out of spite?
That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.
What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. (acts like he did in the movie) Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. (does the next look) I mean, beyond that, Im risking a punch in the mouth. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?
I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.
(ironic outrage) The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!
Hey, hey, what are you doing, that?s my quarter.
I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?
So, how did you get up there? Did you say you had to use the bathroom?
Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!
He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in.
Well, her belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) Im bored. Talk to me.
So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?
Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.
Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.
So why didn't you tell her the code?
So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.
Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?!
Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' "Where's your jock strap?" Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.
Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your guy?
Babu? Babu...[waves Babu to come to table] Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just, it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?
You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
Do you want me to break up with you?
We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these women.
I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.
Yes you do. That's what you both think.
Relax, hes late. Hes always late. Its part of his M.O.
I'll get you another one just like it!
Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.
All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. She's at CALVIN KLEIN's right now.
Oh, no. I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with it.
I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.
The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.
No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!
Yeah, I blamed it on you. Hi Tim.
Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours. (And with that, Jerry made the most fatal mistake of his life)
(starts pulling them apart) Alright break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells)
Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.
Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.
No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey)
No,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.
I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I? (throws coat over his right shoulder)
I mean all that stuff is so small.. ((ELAINE is wryly assessing him)) stupid..
(walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!
How long are you suppose to leave it on for?
Ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.
Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?
I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes.
You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.
I'm going to the hospital to see Fulton. I'm not even saying hello, I'm going right into material.
Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much. (To Kramer) I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!
These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you?
(to himself) Hoh, that Milos. (to Patty) Well uh, what shall we do, uhm, care for a cup of coffee?
I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
(To bartender) Can I have a club soda? (To Ronnie) Goin' on tonight?
So as he's telling the story he starts crying.
Well put something down, youre taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac and Artie, theyre all coming over here before the wedding?
Is there a captain's hat involved in this?
(cynical) This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday?
Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things about you from George.
Well maybe he's got like a, cheerful mental hold on you.
But you gotta know how to work the projector.
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.
Why don't you go to another nail shop?
Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Just give me a little squeeze.
If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?
The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?
Here. Take a look. What, what is that?
You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin them whenever I want!
Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) "Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."
And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
(annoyed) All right. (after a pause) Hey, you know what's weird?
Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.
Well, it has nothing to do with you.
Look Kramer, i-i-if I'm gonna live over there, y-y-you gotta take some of this stuff out. I mean this thing is really freaking me out (holds up a ventriloquist dummy). I feel like its gonna come to life in the middle of the night and kill me.
Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..
We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.
Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price?
Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.
You're going out with the stationery store guy?
Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!
Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.
Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.
Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
Hey. How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?
I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes.
(CONT'D) And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.
And you want to be my latex salesman.
I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.
hey where were you last night? I looked for you, I didn't see you
They guy's in my house right now. What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.
I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.
(derisively at Kramer) Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?
This thing has never worked right. (holding the machine in his hand)
Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George "Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again."
Yeah, but why would you... (Kramer is eating a peach then disgusted he spits it out) Bad peach?
(interrupts) What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today. (on the phone) Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we would do that. Okay. Great! Thanks a million! Okay, bye.
That's the way they do it in Vegas.
So George and I went up to NBC and we told them the idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract.
Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do some TV spots for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store. That was Leapin' Larry himself, I'm gonna meet with him tomorrow.
O.k., good, I'll see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.)
Elaine? How did you rope her into this?
You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!
Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.
He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.
Inka-dink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink.
Now thats not fair! So where did you meet this guy?
(To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.
No, go ahead, I second-hand smoke two packs a day.
(wistful) I don't know, I just see you guys together.
You want food, don't cha? (nodding his head up and down)
I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.
No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?
Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?
Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.
I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck.
I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.
I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating.
Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?
Yeah, so do you. (George enters with a newspaper.)
We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.
But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.
So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more "grease monkey".
Well, good night [holds hand out and shakes hand]
I cant think about it now. Come on, Im going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.
Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.
Look at this, my ankle's all bitten up.
So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy.
Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.
No, Elaines got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and hes suppose to do it.
It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!
What do you think the dry-cleaners is your own personal closet!
Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?
(frustrated, to self) The whole system is breakin' down!
(Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) It'll be on your conscience.
So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!
I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.
I don't understand why we have to eat now.
Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.
But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
What, What is this? What is she doing here?
So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?
It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ...
Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!
Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone.
Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.
Hey, I got a real thing about "shushing"!
Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 650 AM tomorrow morning.
Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?
That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great! (he starts to install the table)
Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series.
Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.
I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?
So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought ... What a coincidence. We're just about to eat.
Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.
How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?
At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.
Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time.
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.
Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?
I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.
No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?
Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!
Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?
All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff.
What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!
Uh, this is George. (reaches for her name) Im sorry...
There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.
Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.
Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-
Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.
(indicates with his thumb) Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.
I can't believe your a friend of mine.
No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.
All right, all right, I?ll wear this. It's bad enough I?ve got to go to the opera I?ve got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here.
(struggling to open a bottle with his bandaged finger) I can't do it. (A LA GODFATHER) Look what they did to my boy, They massacred my boy.
Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?
Oh, I was just looking for er, some... gum or... mint.
That's a hell of an organization they're running up there. I can't understand why they haven't won a pennant in 15 years.
well, you know, sometimes a square is everything
Kramer, (Trying to pass him) get outta my way!
Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, "Oh. Tube socks." What are you gonna do about it?
(thinking) Yeah, thats normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?
What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?
Who do I know who would have even been in a limousine yesterday anyway. Uhh-O h-owow!
(surprise) You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building too?
Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.
Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.
So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you.
How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?
(quickly moves over toward Matthew) What the *beep*(fuck) are you doing? You little piece of *beep*(shit)!
You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?
I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, Well, its ruined. And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, Its not our fault. Were not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation. You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? Theyre cleaning our clothes, but theyre not getting anything wet. Its all dry. I know theres gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that theyre using. Theres no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (Jerry brushes off his shirt.) Thats dry cleaning. I dont think thats what theyre doing back there. They dont have eighty guys going, Come on, hurry up! Theres a lot of shirts today!
(rising) I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the speed-dial.
Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.
I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.
So, you would date a married guy? That's so hacky.
No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.
Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.
All right, do you want the quarter, take the quarter, but don't try and tell me it's yours.
And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month!
(in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room) Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad, you look so different.
Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets.
(picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt off?
Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.
Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?
Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.
I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there.
Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer.
Yes. (To Jenny) You're sure there's nothing we can do?
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal, (steer).
If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.
(walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.
People are going to steal from you. You cant stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker, whos gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They cant get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.
No I can't she didn't leave her name or number.
I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.
(trying to defuse the situation) Look, no-one is lifting anything.
It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.
Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.
Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something.
Its a good mirror. (They look at their menus.) So, what are you gettin?
Don't you ever talk about her like that!
Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in.
Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, you were right. I'll do anything!
Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.
And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry)
I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
Oh, nothing happened, you know, but is was great.
(having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.
You can't go to China What about your job?
Where do you suppose that could've come from?
No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.
Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.
Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.
You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!
What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasnt the one.
No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 1030.
(looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!
You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?
She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.
And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises.
I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.
Got lost? We went to school here for three years.
All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.
So he just gets soup. He wants to save the meal. So now I got to do it all over again.
But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.
I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.
No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.
So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots.
And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.
Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
you know, I think George has a non-sexual crush on him
People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression 'The best revenge is living well' I've said this, in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice, doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him, 'Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting, french doors, a divan. That'll show those punks.'
I don't know if they have land guys.
I dont know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I cant decide.
Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?
Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.
Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?
You know, the water pressures terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower.
They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys.
Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.
George got him fired. He squealed on him.
(pulling on a jacket) They had a cancellation and they instantly called me.
So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?
You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.
So why don't they talk like that now?
It has nothing to do with her sister.
I don't know, but you don't have it.
Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.
Sure, its like robbing a bank. You dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.
Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?
Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house?
Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut.
We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?
So you want me to get the books? Is that it?
(Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?
Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - theyre doing sign language now.
While you were in jail. So you're free.
There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.
I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright, I'm dropping you off at work, right?
He yells and you don't get your soup.
Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.
Well we're sitting here together. Why wouldn't you think that.
(long pause).......Sure. ( humms a song then stares at the toothbrush)
(exasperation) You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents.
Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me.
I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
(To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom buzzes) That's Elaine. (Kramer buzzes her in. Jerry talks into the phone) Kramer.. (To Kramer) George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.
(A couple of days ago I used a public phone), go over time on the call, hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, "Yeah, operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?"
Hey ya know I read an unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the other day, did you know the original title for "War and Peace" was "War--What Is It Good For?"!
All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!
I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous!
Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me.
Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin?
You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...
Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.
You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal(sp?) before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.
"Of course" was the last thing he said?
Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.
No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?
Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)
Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for? I don't know about that, I'll have to think about it. I'll let you know. Okay, bye.
Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.
What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it.
Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!
Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.
You're not a little anything, Newman. So just pack it up and move it out of here.
She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence
Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?
I don't have it. You want half my omelet? (holds his omelet plate up to Bania)
Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?
I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no.
Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. >click click click<...
All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?
Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.
See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.
(As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George.
Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why dont you just settle it like mature adults?
I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. (Miss Rhode Island laughs.)
It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.
My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didnt want to move to Florida, but theyre in their sixties, and thats the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old peoples house with a golf cart, jump out, Lets go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. Drop it! I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversations so boring. Its so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, What if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass. You know. Come back in, theres broken glass, everybodys all upset. No, Im all right. I was just a little bored there. And uh no, Im fine. I came back. I wanted to hear a little more about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Lets pick it up right there.
Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts, so he killed him.
I cant believe it! This guy ripped me off!
All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you.
A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?
It was the single worst moment of my life.
Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar!
I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.
So I know this guy. Im getting all my sneakers at a discount now.
I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.
It's not even my car, it's a rental.
I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. (Lena is puzzled.)
Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets.
Why don't you see what you can do?
Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours.
Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?
And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking?
By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.
You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.
So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?
Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine.
I don't think I can be that nice.
Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?
Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. >click click<
I don't know Kramer, ahh, my concern is that ....
Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.
I'm callin' Elaine. See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley.
So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.
(Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah?
Cheque. Now, the fact is, if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, yknow, cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they dont know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster (Jerry draws imaginary book from a holster.) Who do I make it out to? Theres my ID. Theres something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I dont know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, I dont have any money, but if youll contact these people, Im sure theyll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I dont have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?
Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?
Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?
So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.
Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit.
Hey Seth. Man it is coming down hard out there.
Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up.
When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their face, you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going with somebody.
I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)
Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before.
Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.
Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.
She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.
Ya what was this? (HE IMITATES MOHEL'S FLINCHING)
Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.
I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.
No, we don't care, we just want to go.
Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune.
All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll meet you in front of the theatre.
All right. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle Arbys no more than once a month. And in exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game, and doesnt read a book.
Got 'em on the street, from a scal... (catches himself again)
Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank.
(more disgusted) Ohhhh! You cant! Its impossible! Theres no break in the conversation where you can go, All right then... You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.
What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must be something. What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks?
... I think. Have some more wine. (Jerry pours his whole glass of wine into her glass.)
Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.
You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.
I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?
I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.
All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom cab.
Oh, well, I didnt actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into him there. (putting on coat)
Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry won't let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesnt that bother you?
What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?
Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.
About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?
Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?
Thank you very much, that's great- >click< Oh! Hold on a sec, I got a call on the other line. >click click< Hello?
Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.
But that is not what they would have you believe.
Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!
What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I would've done, if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!!
The uh toilet brush is under the sink.
(to the phone) No believe me, Im always up at this hour. How are you?... Great... Sure... What time does the plane get in?... I got my friend George to take me...
Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...
Well, thats it. Look, Im going to Vermont. I dont want to think about this. Im selling.
I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. (Slams the door on Newman's face. Then tries to delay talking to Newman by keeping the conversation with George going) So, you want a protein shake, or something?
(calmly getting up with plate of chicken) Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, (drops chicken into sink) was, for two.
Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?
And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.
Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?
(Losing it, mad) Look, it's not my shirt.
Could you at least get a hat for me?
(examining) Hey George, you know what? I think this crest is different. It's got a moose on it.
Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
(to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?
You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola!
Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years.
He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket books. Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.
Well. (calling down the hall) Call if you're gonna be late!
(looking over the list) Hmm ah. I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?
Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.
Well. This should be a very interesting evening.
(Takes the ticket back and looks at it, flips it over) The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too.
Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination? You couldn't possibly visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life size snotty puppet. I guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. That's the end of the line for a mannequin. "What ever happened to Bob?" "Have you seen that new Volvo commercial? He's got a bulls eye right in his face." Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, I guess these are the two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves. Well dressed or getting killed. I'm sure there is some pro-mannequin organization that doesn't even like you to use the term mannequin. "Hey they're not mannequins, they're the life deprived."
(Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..
Either that, or theyve got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why dont you just go to the cashier?
I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.
I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.
All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a mnage  trois with her and her roommate.
You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.
I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?
It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. "It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad." But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, "I refuse to put any thought into this at all." Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?
No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!
I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.
(Surprised to see her, he gets up) Where's George?
Alright, then just get rid of it. You wont have any problem.
How much money is this gonna cost me?
Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?
I want this baby fully loaded. (listens) Well, how soon can you get it there? (listens) Oh, that's terrific. (listens) Okay, thanks, bye.
You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store.
Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and find my number.
Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.
(scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.
You faked it? Why would you do that?
Alright, I'll change my shoes. (Heads back to his apartment. George follows.)
(thoughtful) Hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey, there it is.
I know. Im really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.
No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing. (Jerry picks up the phone and dials the number) I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?
Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.
I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.
They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.
I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?
Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than "coffee machine show."
You're not qualified to work at the catalog.
Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made.
What do you mean you don't think so?
(trying to shut the trunk hood) Something wrong with this trunk.
(to George) Did you call me a wuss?
No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station.
Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.
It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination. I would have killed this man. Torn him limb from limb, ripped the flesh right off his bones ...
Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I?m serious, I?m not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.
I know it's a big problem.. she puts like four pieces in her mouth, it's ridiculous, I don't think we're gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
Im sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
Especially that big kid up in the front. (Mr. Pitt is shown on the television, trying to hold up the deflating Woody balloon.) How old is he? (The phone rings.) Hello?
I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?
No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. Maybe we should ask him.
Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.
We found out his super power was lack of money.
I had a statue! What should I do?
I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine!
Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno.
You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.
So George, how do I beat this lie detector?
Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.
Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?
It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.
Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.
Now, there's a career path you may have overlooked.
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
I think if ones going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. Its common courtesy. I dont know. Thats just the way I was brought up.
NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.
(thinking) So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?
So, are you gonna go out with her?
Of course I can, am I being funny now?
Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?
My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?
So you were talking, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") you're having pleasant conversation, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") then all of sudden...
Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.
Ill have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
Hey, wait a second. You know, we could share a cab. They're playing at the same Cineplex.
Oh no. Thats impossible. Id rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.
What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?
No economic reason for them to be here.
Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.
Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?
Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.
So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?
Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time.
You stink. You know you stink. What is this?
Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, "Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms."
He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?
(CONT'D) You want me to help you with that?
Well you're not even a fan. I was at game six - you didn't even watch it.
Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on.
(C0NT'D) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.
They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!
Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!
Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.
I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?
Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?
You were saying Stan? I-I'm sorry about that.
Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary.
What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.
(Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.
When's he leaving? (putting some items into the refrigerator)
I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight....
You really used to have a think full head of hair.
I don't know him. I know who he is.
(startled - eyes wide open) Hello, is somebody there? (scurrying sound) Mr.- Mr. Marbles?
Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?
Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?
Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex.
I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy could write checks to himself right out of my account.
George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.
They're ladies' glasses! You know all you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.
Good luck, It's sold out for the next three weeks.
It had fat in it, it's not good for you.
Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.
I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin else.
(Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) I didn't say anything.
I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot.
In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
(walking out) Thanks for having me over, guys.
Really? How come you never pursued her before?
I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.
No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman.
I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.
He looks like you and he's working from the inside?
Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. (Kramer picks up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.) Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! (Kramer starts filling a pot with water.) What are you doing with that?
Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. ! Celebrate! How about some champagne?
Sure. See, things always even out for me.
Yeah. Im having a wonderful time. (it's obvious he isn't)
Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.
Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!
(disgusted) Ohh! You know, and sometimes shell go, (imitates Marlene) Hello, Jerry? And Ill go, Oh, hi Marlene. And then its Jerry...
I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment for two days. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my parents. they'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own I'm sure it's gonna be some awful dump. Wait a second.. Have you checked in The Plaza yet?
Oh Yeah we went way out and wild.
What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?
I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't remember anything about you.
The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George.
He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.
Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.
I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.
Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents.
No. We gotta go to the soup place.
This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.
Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding.
I don't even know what you're talking about.
All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry.
You know, I think he wears a piece.
Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there.
(Pointing) He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..
D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?
(thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And Ive still got another day! Ive got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. (to Vanessa) Thats a nice watch. Do you wind it?
What do I say if he picks up?
He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.
Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)
Oh the baby's fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt.
I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table.
Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you.
You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?
No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!
Best friend- Ive never been to your apartment.
Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
He went crazy from one note. He couldnt get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.
No. The police have no leads (sitting on the couch arm) and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.
Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?
All right, go, it's a race! Come on!
You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!
Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.
You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.
Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.
Well, if that's not that, what is that?
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.
Oh, they're all the same. Here. [gives him Dust Buster] Now if you'll excuse us, ..
The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.
Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?
You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.
All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---
So write a letter.. move to another...move to Staten Island., 'lot easier to blend in a sea of people in Staten Island than China believe me.
Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing and
Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and put it in.
Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. (standing) I'm going to the bathroom.
No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.
Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
(in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.
It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.
Oh. (chuckles) Really? You don't seem that desperate.
(quietly) Hey, uh, Milos, I don't mind rolling over here, but could you lighten up on the 'not a man' stuff?
Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestl's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--
You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go 'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.'
On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!
So you dont know whats wrong with him?
Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the etiquette?
No, see, we didnt have ponies. Im sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..
Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves, wanted to come home and start working on his floor.
(answering, quickly) If you know what happened in the Met game, dont say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, Im sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no
(Gestures to his forehead) Youre getting that vein again.
Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.
Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.
$40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh...
Well, if I hear an anguished "oink", I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look (HE POINTS AT PASSERBY) Human, human, human... (HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR, WITH ALARM.) (WITH MOCK ALARM) Wait a second! (Grabs Kramer)
Yeah, but this is different , this is like ,you know, semi digested food stuff. You know the next stop is the stomach and you can take it from there.
Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!
Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.
I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?
I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory.
Then what do you call it? People dont just bump into each other and have sex. This isnt cinemax.
If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.
(interrupting) Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.
You had how many dates with him? Three?
Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat)
What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?
You're lying! You got it, I want that number!
Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it!
Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it!
No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.
so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?
Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer, sitting on his lawn chair with a sparkler)
Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you.
Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. (To Kramer) I never should have cashed those checks!
Hey, I've been back four days, I want my mail.
Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.
Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents.
What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?
Sex, thats meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; thats heavy. Thats like an hour.
Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.
Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected, outwardly.
I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.
Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.
Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer. It shows at least he's making an effort.
Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.
I just hope that whole pony incident didnt put a damper on the trip.
(to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? (wondering what the hell's Kramer doing)
Great talkin' to you. (Nina leaves. To himself) What the hell is e-mail?
Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up...
..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.
Can I make it up to you? Ill give you fifty bucks for the jug.
Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.
No, no......(long pause . they stare at the walls) Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?
Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's uh yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it?
Yeah. I want that coat. (Jerry opens his wallet, looking for the dry-cleaning ticket)
You know I went out once with a nude model. Never let me see her naked. Hundreds of people see her naked every week, except me. Needless to say it was quite vexing.
Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's better than eating it.
You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?
Hold it, hold it...Look your gonna need the jaws of life to get out of those things.
What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.
Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!
I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble. I'll do it myself.
Have you ever spent any time with these people...?
Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.
See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.
-programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'
Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!
Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them.
I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.
I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.
Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may depend on it.
No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.
Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?
(determined) I wanna join. I need it to become a member.
Oh, alright ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....
Oh, what about this one? Look at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for. (Sits on the couch.) Oh, yeah!
Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.
I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.
Hey, guess what. I just bought my father a Cadillac
Should I get it? I hate these moments. Im hearing the dual voices now, you know, What about the money? Whats money?
Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.
(To Assistant) Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.
Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.
George, I am loving this no wallet thing.
Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town.
You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.
Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally, yeah this is Jerry,I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and..
Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.
Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up) Since I said what?
Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet?
So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?
I cant believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.
(To himself) Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. (George doesn't react) What's the matter?
(sarcastically) Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.
Oh my god, you're kidding. (dives for his wallet) Hang on a second. (reading from his registration) It's JVN 728.
The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the other -person.
So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo?
You know what? I'll be with you in a minute.
Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.
Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here.
I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?
Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.
What do you mean they're not going to do anything, they're the cops, they gotta do something, he just put the kibosh on me, do you know what the kibosh means, its a kibosh!
It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.
Yeah. You know, kind of a peace offering. Cute.
I don't know what to tell you, Elton.
Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club...
Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.
I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
(Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.
I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.
Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a person could still make a mistake like that.
So tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?
Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?
I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.
Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.
What should I do? (to Alton) Uh, were taking a cab, arent we?
But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.
Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are?
I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.
I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.
There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her
Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner.
You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.
A few stitches? I've never had stitches. I'll be deformed. I can't live with that. It goes against my whole personality. It's not me!
(gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!
He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.
Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.
I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing.
Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will.
I think that's a "what's good for the goose is good for the gander".
OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you know you are always welcome in my home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story.
I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!
Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!
What, he doesn't like my taste in music?
(on the phone) Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.
Hello? Yeah he's here. (to Kramer) Hey! It's for you.
That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus?
Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh
Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side.
I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something.
I don't know. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley..."
We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my...
A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!
I don't need a personal trainer. (Kramer comes in) all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.
A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?
No, I dont think so. Ive seen you two together. You make each other miserable. Its kismet.
You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.
Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers?
Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?
I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.
(to Elaine, still joking) He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!
Get in the car! Get in the car!
Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. "I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa " Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... (Naomi exits) it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality.
Didn't you see the sign on the door?
Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.
(Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.
I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods)
Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.
You got a little shmootz there (picks something on her sweater)
Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)
Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender! (an event guard stops them)
I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example.
Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said "Too bad he's gay".
All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...
Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.
Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I-I just wanted to ask you a question when we we're going out did you have orgasms?... Okay, thanks... No that's it... Ya, Okay, bye.
Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.
Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What drives me to take chances like that?
It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.
If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.
Whats the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!
You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.
Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!
George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality.
(quiet) Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..
Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?
'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.'
(eating pop corn) hmm I love this artificial flavoring I like it better than butter I think it's more consistent
Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.
Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there.
Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
You want to spend the rest of your life with her
Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.
Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.
Just put a coffee table book over it.
Oh, like you know what you're talking about!
(putting on his coat to go downstairs, he finds the key in his coat pocket) I believe this belongs to you.
Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.
Is that like the end of the world or something?
Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors.
Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.
(pointing out the obvious) George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him.
(Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.
Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out?
The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. "Who was that clown?", "I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?", "The guy's a clown!". How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, "What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!"
I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.
Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?
You know 'm just curious, How did you know she wasn't my girlfriend?
Just go back and ask him again. (Slams the door on Kramer)
Well how did he react when you gave it to him?
(Thinking) What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship. Gotta relax.
Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here...
Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off?
He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV.
(to Kramer) It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Wheres she gonna get five thousand? She doesnt have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. Shes gone. Then you come in, Why dont you loan her five thousand? What do you care? Youve got five thousand. Give her five thousand!
Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.
You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!
You never really had the right comeback, anyway.
Theres the giant ball of oil. Clares right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!
No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.
Well, thats a lot of money. But, if thats the way its gotta be, thats the way its gotta be.
No I wasn't there. (enters and slams the door)
Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.
I guess you can take anything, but actual work.
That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it.
Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.
Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I wouldve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. Hes so self-involved.
Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see her tonight.
On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?
I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket.
Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.
Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.
(extemporising) That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go.
Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?
I'm sorry, Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen)
Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?
Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.
You want to go with me to NBC?
Lemme see if I understand this. In other words, you held out
We're here discussing our script with your father.
How late are the stores open? Im thinking of maybe uh, buying a new TV and smash it over my head.
What are you bringing snowballs in here for?
Thats what you want to see, yeah. . . . Yeah, you want to trade your hair for some phlegm.
I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...
Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.
If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.
What are you gonna do about the roommate?
Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.
I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.
Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.
Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.)
I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)
Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?
I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.
And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?
This has 'international incident' written all over it.
Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.
Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.
What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty minutes of 'So, who's from out of town?'
Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.
So were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.
Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?
Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.
No, "yada yada" is good. She's very succinct.
You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.
We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.
Well yes I did that's true. A couple of a guys I knew in the coastguard told me about her.... and I sensed that she had the anger and intensity that I needed to make this film work.
Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.
(as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.
Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit.
Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice?
(hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman.
Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.
Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person -
Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good things.
Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. (Faint) I don't care about that.
Yeah. Specifically 930 shows. Seen any good 930 shows at the Paragon, Willie?
So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil
(watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this?
Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?
Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.
Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something.
Yeah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.
Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not, a chicken.
Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.
George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.
He's a boy who lives in a bubble.
How 'bout if it was something like " I can't find my receipt my place's a stye.
I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out.
Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.
Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?
You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?
Can you relax, its a cup of coffee. Claire is a professional waitress.
How many session did my parents paid for?
Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)
Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia, watching Jerry on TV. Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.
Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.
Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.
Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'
Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.
Hey, is that my maple syrup? Oh, ya. (Kramer hands it over.)
Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!
Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?
Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump over the net.
No. We both just saw the same monkey.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want.
Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.
Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.
I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
(As George sits down) George, we need to talk.
Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...
Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.
What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming "There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!" And then, when they all run into the other direction, we'll jump in the car!
Oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh that's terrific... Mulva.
so the woman was walking around in a bra
Meat? I dont, I dont know, go... hunt! (Kessler opens the refrigerator and sticks his head in.) Well what happened in the game anyway?
Yeah, I think it is. (They walk toward the man. Jerry hesitates.) Wheres Elaine?
Yeah, well that relationships really got a lot of potential.
Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.
I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.
okay , bye (to George) What happened , did you take it off?
No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o.
Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door behind him)
and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye.
Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.
I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a "magical world" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.
I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.
Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
I dont even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, Ive met them three times in my life.
Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number.
(Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!
No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch)
Yeah..... He caught me So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend to look at the coat.
(reluctant) Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy.
to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?
Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?
oh I'm sorry I didn't get most of that.. isn't that Kramer over there?
No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.
(to George) You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.
Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.
You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!
They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What do they look like."
Ok, great, well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu.
What are you doing? Were going out to dinner in ten minutes.
Well, I didnt uh really mean a pony, per se...
Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.
(thinks) Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize?
Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.
(aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?
Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.
I didnt open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.
Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!
No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?
Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?
Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?
(nonplused) You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?
He went back? What do you mean he went back?
Not because youre dirty, not because youre clean  just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine...
Yeah. (hands racquet to Kramer) I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it.
(Pointing) But are you still master of your domain?
I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.
Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for show.
I don't know what you should do with it.
Did you see the look on that guy's face?
Oh that's George. (presses the intercom button) Yeah?
You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
I don't get this. How did this happen. I don't have a dog.
Y'know, I think I'll pass on the "Guys And Dolls"...
Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.
When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.
No no no, dont interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what its doing. Just let it finish.
I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night only, the big screen. My hands are tied!
Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.
I feel terrible. (Kramer smiling) I mean, Ive seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I cant go any further, but... Shes just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I cant breathe. Its like a drug.
The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?
Aren't you going to take the check down?
George what the hell are you doing over there? I told you to mind your own business now stay out of my affairs!
(Nodding) I think you may have something there.
Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.
Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit) And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.
"Of course.... But that's got nothing to do with it."
Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen.
Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.
Look, I gotta try and help the guy.
How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?
Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. "Oo that little tail really turns me on."
Go ahead shake his hand. You're Jerry Seinfeld. You've been on the Tonight Show.
(Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 'French Impressionist Paintings'?
I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?
Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.
That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.
I dont really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because theres that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, youre sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, Im really sorry about this. I dont know why I left that stuff over there. And thats why I could never be a maid, because Id have an attitude. Id find them, wherever they are in the house, Oh, I suppose you couldnt do this? No, dont get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldnt dust. No, this is too tough, isnt it?
I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!
Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone to ghost read it.
(acidly) Shes full. So, Big Daddy. Im just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?
And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's pretty sick.
Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.
You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.
Well it?s very flattering. How did you get these tickets, I heard they're impossible to get.
Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
You asked a date to go to the operation?
Why would I freak out? (To himself) Pilot...
Hi. Hi. Look, I don't know what you think --
Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em. (starts backing away as Kramer follows him around the room carrying the underwear)
Oh why don't you go sleep over at Newman's.
If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.
I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.
Wait 'til I tell him about the book.
The way I feel when I go places with you? (Kramer enters.) Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?
Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?
(placatory) Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me.
I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, its very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, Call the police. You really should call the police. So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, Yeah, Im calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... Im gonna see some real action. Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out The Report. They give you Your Copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I dont really think were gonna crack this case, do you? Its not like Batman, where theres three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up, hes dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him, hes a PENGUIN!
Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?
Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.
Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.
Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun.
I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone.
You want to get something to eat first?
You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
Um, I haven't got my watch on. It's being fixed.
(looking outside) Hey Newman, is that your red car?
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?
Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.
Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down. It's a business.
Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?
There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!
Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?
Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.
Here he is... that's the guy! (rolls up window) No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!
Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!
I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.
Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..
You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe its Manage A Trois.
She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.
So, what are you up for? How about Mexican?
It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck!
I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand.
Already? That was fast... I assume he's not a High Talker...
(with no emotion) It's okay. Everything is going to be all right.
This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!
Wow! Zanadu . No wonder youre putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) May I?
I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!
Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.
Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? Theres Elastic Man... Plastic Man...
Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'
I like that thing in your hair there.
Hey, do you know what the Whip does?
