What?
Astronaut!
Well, no, I'm not one of those.
I might need you to get me a soda.
I don't have a washcloth.
So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.
What move?
Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...
You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.
Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?
You can't go to China What about your job?
(fetching a drink from the fridge) Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.
I'm flying down to Florida tomorrow.
I want that number!
Which flavor?
She got anything in your medicine cabinet?
Who?
No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.
Well, would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.)
No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'
Hello?
Uh, no. Should I have?
Yeah, there's a new one in there.
(to drive him crazy) Who is this..
What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present)
You didn't look down?
Don't you see what's goin' on here???... No boxers, no Jockeys...
I don't know.
Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)
Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.
Hey.
I don't know.
Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a One-woman show?
Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.
Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what youre talking about, now, come on, come with me. (stands up) I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.
Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again.
Take it.
What's with you?
You are soo good lookin'.
No you didn't. He knows he's bald.
They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What do they look like."
Well, you know what they say. Lucky in love, Unlucky with fruit.
Well, what does that mean?
One second. Hello.
Gee, I just didnt expect it from the way youve been acting.
I was going to say, "Being a good host."
You gotta wake him up!
(he hits a few keys and looks over at her) Cash advance... yes (hits a key)  no (he looks over again) balance inquiry... no (he looks again) receipt.... no (he looks again) processing... processing... (He opens the box, pulls out his money and then looks at the woman and says) I won!
Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.
Oh my god, it's Bania and Jenna.
(on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV for another minute) The letter, that's the letter!
Me, why?
Is that so?
Well, that all depends. . .
Yes, I know, I know.
Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.
We're dead.
Like this? (imitates the walk)
You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!
she's one of these people, always have to be different
(Pleading) George, would you help me, please?
Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?
So why didn't you tell her the code?
It was a *joke*...
What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again.
Look at him.
Well you have insurance...
That's what they get!
Hey Drake! Hi Drake!
Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.
Got it. (but now a man-hand grabs his arm) Uh!
Never. (The elevator door opens.) Wait a second. Thats her. On the right.
(taps on the window) Hey...
(looking shocked) Really? When?
Well maybe they were here from before.
Not even once?
Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
(giving in) Alright.
Oh my God!
Well, what do you mean?
I thought you said it was imminent.
You don't wanna get married?
Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.
Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.
Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it They're roommates. She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back. She's not gonna do that.
I guess.
The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.
You dont care?
(answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.
Pez?
Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. (George laughs) So, when do you move into the apartment?
So you don't think it's attractive?
Your mother reads your mail?
(jumps in surprise) Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be gone.
Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before.
Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.
People dont turn down money. Its what separates us from the animals.
Oh my God, George!
Yes!!!
You know I don't even know why I brought you.
I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.
What?
All right?
(musing) What if it's Neil Armstrong?
(aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?
What did you do?
(rueful acceptance) Oh, yeah, I understand.
You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?
Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.
I loaned the car to George.
Like what?
(He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.
Why not?
Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.
Hey.
Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited.
It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.
Yeah, I know.
Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie.
I'm laying down! Then we'll see how he does up there, without all the assistance.
Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.
Oh friendship... friendship, shmanship .
So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, Yeah!!
Oh, saffron! That sounds good.
I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back.
Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of?
Nothin'.
Come in.
hey where were you last night? I looked for you, I didn't see you
All right now you listen and you listen good! (he grabs Kramer's legs and throws him down the couch)
Tractor!
Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.
Hello Leo. You don't have to yell.
(continuing) No rejection, no guilt, no remorse.
You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!
Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner
Yeah.
(handing it over) Here.
Yeah, I think I do.
Oh, right, right.
You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder?
What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods.) Did he tell you whats gonna happen? (George shakes his head.) How long were you there?
(quietly) I told you to cut it out.
Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here (points to kitchen), here (points to living room), or here (makes similar circle with his hands).
Not getting it.
What you must understand, Elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) Youve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.
I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.
Darren?
It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.
Loni Anderson.
Women aren't like us.
George...
Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . What could he do?
So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?
Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)
I thought you were gonna watch a video.
Yeah.
You know, you're little hair hat there.
Yeah.
I don't know what's happening to me.
So?
I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them are doing her dance as they go)
Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.
Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.
Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order)
Couldn't be...
If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.
Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?
It's okay, that's not bad.
Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?
(feeling face) Good shave today...
Hey. So how was"Blame it on the Rain?"
George too.
(smiling) I don't think so.
I'm not letting you cheat, Newman. You're not getting anywhere near that board.
Yeah, well, until this bill is paid...
Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress.
Just me?
What the hell are you doing there?
What happened to Karen?
No,, but thank you.
There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.
And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!
Oh really? Elaine Marie Benes...
It.
Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?
A-Ahahahahah. Who told you?
You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is! I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, someone asks me which way is Israel, I don't fly off the handle.
Hold it, hold it...Look your gonna need the jaws of life to get out of those things.
What, what, what's wrong with you?
Name it.
So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.
Doctor? Hes a podiatrist.
All right, Ill be back.
So what would you do? You'd hitch?
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.
Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses... I need an awkward pause.
We'll always have...pancakes.
I bought you a Cadillac. (hands over the keys) Here you go.
Well? Go ahead.
Elaine!
Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally, yeah this is Jerry,I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and..
Oh?
(points to George) Ya.
Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.
Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart.
But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure.
...that's why men hunt and women nest.
I'm sorry.
Really?
You know, I don't even know my IQ.
What look? Nothing.
Why would he steal a box of raisins?
Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin?
Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?
Well what about me! If you're going like that, I?m not going like this.
No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.
Yeah, but--
Kramer, cockfighting is illegal.
Why didn't you come up with your own?
Uh! Really .That's nice.
You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught.
All of a sudden he gets hungry.
Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.
Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
And that guy is your new boss?
All right. Calm down.
So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?
George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say,kookie talk.
That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.
"Lose that"? That's not a Hollywood expression!
Look, youre a nice guy, its just that... we dont have anything in common.
Youre too nice a guy.
Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.
No. No. I was kidding. It's terrible.
Ya that was some list.
The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.
Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?
Mulva.
No...
All right, that's enough of that. (Jerry takes the plates and hands them to a waitress.)
Look, you can hang out here if you want.
Medium crab bisque.
Oh! Oh! *Delores*!
Yeah, I know about the three dates.
I can't. The car's at the mechanics.
Well, he flinched, sort of.
So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?
Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?
Are you serious, what about Elaine?
Really?
Here you go. (Poppie stands up and takes the money.) Anyway, I'm sorry again about the...(notices a large, wet stain on his couch)...the...the...
Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!
You would turn me in?
Well that's all I got.
Really? Did you hear that? Somebody else was killed!
Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.
Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. "Oo that little tail really turns me on."
Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.
When did they ever spend any money?
No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.
OK ... (nodding his head up and down) This is it cha know
The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.
No. Why?
(Gets up) Get out!
Well, guess I'll get going.
Yes I know that.
I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.
(interrupts) I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.
Uh huh.
I wasn't thinking! I don't know.
She did, you insisted.
(to baby) Hello. How are you/
No.
Wavy.
What happened with all the shirts?
Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?
(looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!
No, that's Krama.
You what? You passed? How could you do that?
Really?
Uh?
Hey, how's the anti-mail campaign going?
Oh hi Alex.
Good, good. You remember George.
Peach.
Yeah. Good seeing you again Karen.
Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.
Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Yknow Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, shes probably screamin at those aliens, I gotta have a lo mein!
And who makes the switch?
We don't hear that. (They enter the elevator)
" But I'm damaged goods now."
Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. (Kramer goes to get the suit. Elaine enters.)
So what's going on with Simon? Did he leave?
Did you say, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show" or, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"? (Elaine comes over.)
A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?
You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.
Yeah right.
So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?
Oh, no?
Hey! How you doin'?
Would you?
How about adult contemporary?
I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?
I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.
Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!
Hey, guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!
Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--
You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.
(Thinking) What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship. Gotta relax.
Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show.
Are you serious?
Alright I'm going.
That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?
Because I know who has it.
(After seeing how much his parents like her) Now, I'm not so sure.
I think it's tamber.
Hi Elaine.
(smug) I'm not engaged.
Kramer, let's do this later.
(checking his watch) I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.
Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters)
So, Im on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the...
No.
You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.
Wow, a communist. That's something.
(Stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. (Approaches the intercom) C'mon, let's get it together.. (Through intercom) Yeah?
Game over.
So, that's your poker face.
Well it's very emasculating..
There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my...
Toilet paper?
(walking over the the buzzer to answer it) Oh, that's the Flicks.
Uh-huh.
Well, technically he did apologize.
I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating.
Sure.
Oh! (hitting George)
Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.
You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here. Mike Wichter. He sold plastic straws. You know the ones? You could bend them.
It's Isosceles
Medium crab bisque.
Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...(hugs Meryl.) I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!
(somber) That's wonderful news. Thank you.
Hey look at you.
I'm not getting illegal cable!
Shut up, George.
You're bringing a date to a party?
Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do?
So, what's it about?
Come on up.
Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.
Or something. Yeah, that's a date.
Yeah.
Well, I still think it's wrong.
What're you talkin' about?
How do you get all that wood in here?
There's weather.
No, I don't think so.
Who are you, Mannix?
What?
to himself Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.
Mr. Marbles?
What did you do to my car?!
I need a miracle.
Did you give her a reason?
Well...actually, we kind of broke up.
Don't you think she could tell?
More heavy gravy?
Your butler?
Do you want box or hanger?
Yeah, well, it won't be long.
Because you threw it out.
Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?
Yeah! Too bad.
You mean *a* career.
That's it?
IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE!
Pinter?
It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.
I don't have your suit. I gave it away.
(to George) All right, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend Im disappointed. Youre going to really see me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this. Maybe you should go in the other room.
No, Poppie! No!!
I want this baby fully loaded. (listens) Well, how soon can you get it there? (listens) Oh, that's terrific. (listens) Okay, thanks, bye.
yeah
And by then you've lost interest.
I don't...I dunno.
I'm telling you, the guy took.....
Uh, Keith uh Hernandez.
He did?
No, but I expect to hear anytime.
No steam!
Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. Its the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... (Jerry pushes the door shut.) ...MUST BE CLOSED!!
It is a tad askew.
Oh. (notices a car being jacked up by a tow truck) Hey, isn't this Kramer's car? (yelling up) Hey, Cosmo!! They're towing your car!!
Oh, what are you talkin' about?
I'm NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT! ..
Well I...
I can't.
Keys?!
Thus ends the great ball man experiment.
Well, I was here, thats everyone (laughing).
It's two roosters peckin' at each other!
Why?
Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!
I dont know.. fifteen hundred dollars.
Try me.
She should just give up.
A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.
It is exciting.
Where do I know her?
How would you describe the smell in this house?
I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine...
Then you're in a lot of trouble.
Perpetuation of the species.
The tooth brush in the toilet bowl.
You know, I really need to use the bathroom.
Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?
Hey.
You know it seems impossible.
Really, stopping short. That's a good move.
This is your plan?
What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!
You're racing!
(re the underwear pile) Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
This was your idea!
(to Kramer) Hey (snaps fingers) get your stuff, let's get going.
Ah, no, forget it.
No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.
Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.
(as Kramer walks by) You're a master of race relations.
Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.
Hi.
I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from.
Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.
It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.
Yeah, it's pretty good.
Yes.
Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.
What?
Then, what was all that sniffing?
Oh my... that *is* refreshing...
(uncomfortably) Yeah that's too bad.
Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit.
Hi
It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.
Jerry Seinfeld.
See I was saying "six" but she thought I was saying "sex". We straightened the whole thing out though.
I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.
I'm Vandelay Industries?
And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
He told me a few months ago.
I don't know, regular human time?
You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.
Oh that's George. (presses the intercom button) Yeah?
The Drake is good!
Why not?
See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.
That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.
Mother of God.
Yeah, . . . seriously.
Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?
No!
Is that right?
I guess.
How did they know?!
Hello, Poppie. This is Elaine.
Hey, guess what. I just bought my father a Cadillac
Morning.
Alright, then just get rid of it. You wont have any problem.
Aye, aye.
Ah, how about 830?
Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?
If my father was moving this hed had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (as his father) 'Have you got your end?...Your ends got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your ends got to come down.'
I know. It's like X-ray vision.
You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.
I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?
It's a little ...
I really don't see the difference.
You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!
I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!
Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage from her yet!
My pants!
Why would I wanna do that?
That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.
What community? There's a community?
(Opens the door) C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? (Starts jiggling his keys - as if he's calling out for a dog) Huh? C'mon! C'mon!
Kramer!!! (Jerry points to the lamp post they are about to crash into)
I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.
No, thank you.
Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?
That's a hell of an organization they're running up there. I can't understand why they haven't won a pennant in 15 years.
(sharp) I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.
I would like to know what my names doin in this creep's organizer to begin with.
I know, I know... Well, you know.
(answering phone) Hello?
You want to get something to eat first?
No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?
I wish I could, but, we're friends..
Oh, did he like it?
No! Enjoy your lunch.
Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up)
It's a haaazy mystery.
Yes, I do.
Who would pay that much?
Is he still in town?
Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.
George.
Seth! Wow what has it been like five years?
But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.
Well, this is it. Im selling.
oh.. whoa..
Kramer?!
What are you doing here?
I think Ill take out the garbage.
Hey, how ya doin?
There you go. That'll get you home in time.
Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?
You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!
Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. (pointing at the umbrellas) What've you got in a push-button mini.
And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.
How could you ask her out?
(to Elaine) Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?
I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.
But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
Is this the proper venue?
I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.
Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.
Im gonna make an appointment for you. Well go together.
I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.
Hey Mick.
Yes, Jugdish.
Come on, you gotta let us in
Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?
We'll stay in a hotel tonight.
Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat.
Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.
Oh my god. Look at this.
Okay. (closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self) Didn't come true.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good things.
(proud to Peggy, under his breath) Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. (winks)
The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves)
Gwen?
Aww!
What was on the list?
I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.
Elaine was... in a rush.
No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.
Course you know there is always the possibility, that she called an audible.
(to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)
Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough.
Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.
I told you we shouldn't do it.
Alright, alright. Uh, undo them. I'll help you get them off.
Oh, this is awful.
George?
She didn't stay over?
Yeah, I know.
Oh, no, no, no, wait a second, wait a second th-th-that--
You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.
(quickly) No.
(taps George's chest) Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six.'
Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.
Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying "mickey"!
But I don't want to.
Well, I'm very mysterious by nature. (Jerry knocks on the door) A lot of women find that attractive.
Rachel!
Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.
No, but he would've read your face.
I'm on next, right?
We're here discussing our script with your father.
"Of course" was the last thing he said?
Not a Federal record.
Come on up.
No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.
I think the thing I admire most about the Chinese is that they're hanging in there with the chopsticks. Because, if you think about it, you know, they've seen the fork... by now. I'm sure they've seen the spoon, they're going, "Yeah, yeah, they're OK... We're going to stay with the sticks." I mean, I don't know how they've missed it, thousands of years ago, Chinese farmer gets up, has his breakfast with the chopsticks, goes out and works all day in the field with a shovel... Hello?... Shovel! Not going out there ploughing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues.
(While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands him a nickel)
Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and tear.
You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
C'mon! One whiff!
George got him fired. He squealed on him.
You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.
What?
Well what am I supposed to do now?
Im not taking it back.
At me?
Yeah, sure. My parents will be there.
Come on up.
I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.
..Alright.
How was it?
But I don't know if this is gonna work.
What car?
Who?
I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.
I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...
Hey.
What about bran?
You are. I can't get that thing in my car. (referring to George)
Oh, hi. Soda?
How did they find Babu?
Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?
Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to give it up.
Hellooo Newman.
Inside out! Great.
No one's gonna listen to you.
Ahh! She threw me out.
What happened?
'... downtown.'
Ah, here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) Mmm, delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some.
Yeah, killed. Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.
(pushes George) NOT THAT YOU IDIOT!!
Well, theres this uh, woman might be comin in.
Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. Alright, it's time to go. Come on.. Up.
She had a good time.
Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?
Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... what kind of a sicko would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide (small fingers opening imaginary drawers) Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT hard to get round black buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this? ... is it such a great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, you'll never find them - they save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they're going to fall off too that's the other thing ...
Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.
Oh, no don't say that. You'll jinx me.
All right, you're beyond stink.
Ohh!
I dont know.
Well, what street are you on?
Uh, bathroom.
Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.
George, what's the matter with you?
What are you doing here?
Well, what about Susan?
Yeah.
So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more "grease monkey".
Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.
What?
Corvelay?
George is already in there.
When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers.
A wuss?
Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.
It was nice meeting you
I know enough not to get on them.
I dunno. Hard to say.
(to Helen) What about him?
Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.
Yeah, Im going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days.
So, Puddy, I decided Im gonna go with another 900 convertible.
How do you do? (introducing himself) Uh, Jerry Seinfeld.
You just said 'Yo-yo Ma'.
Will you stop it.
C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody.
Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent. It's very boring.
Not now. She's right inside.
Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.
You know what the odds are on a crash it's a million to one.
Well he's kind of modest.
What?
Oh, isn't that what it's all about?
Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. (holds his nose up like a pig) You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.
No, he didn't show up.
The baldies
Look at the size of his bird!
I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?
Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!
Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.
(answering) Hello?
It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
(setting down a box) No thanks.
Not even on the book jacket?
(Deeply sarcastic) No. You're never here.
I never shoulda told you.
I can't believe I'm losing Pam!
(unheard by Jenna) When the battery runs out.
(Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.
You're not Valerie.
You want to go with me to NBC?
Who?
Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.
Oh that makes a lot of sense.
Why not you call him Maestro.
Hi.
Hey, Lainie, how's the trip going?
I dont know what to do.
George is dating a convict.
Oh!
You're saying something.
Oh.
Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.
Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist.
(finding Frankie, in his hole) Frankie... come on out of there.
Oven mitts?
George is pickin' us up at the airport.
(putting the phone back to his ear) Yeah.
(thinks) Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize?
I hear you're going out with David Putty.
(more disgusted) Ohhhh! You cant! Its impossible! Theres no break in the conversation where you can go, All right then... You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.
Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.
Could we continue this another time.
(struggling to open a bottle with his bandaged finger) I can't do it. (A LA GODFATHER) Look what they did to my boy, They massacred my boy.
Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the etiquette?
What?
You're gonna take this kid to Paris?
Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again.
But you took a nap in it.
I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?
Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.
How do you know his name?
And?
I don't know.
What are you doing?
Seth, it's me. What's more important than catching up with an old college buddy?
You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.
Yup.
And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's pretty sick.
George??
Kramer won't sell.
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal, (steer).
Actually, I did. I put it on last night and slept in it.
(As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George.
(examining) Hey George, you know what? I think this crest is different. It's got a moose on it.
You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?
I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)
Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?
Who is it?
Elaine...
How you gonna do that?
Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?
Patti?
So how was it?
Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.
I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.
I think she meant me, but.
Koko?
Oh.
Would you excuse me a minute? Im gonna go to the bathroom. Ill be right back.
Yeah.
I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?
If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.
Hello Poppie.
What's this?
Alright, I'll call him.
Nope, the cop says its my word against his. Theres nothing they can do.
Why?
May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" across the painting)
(to himself) Gotta be an easier way.
So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?
Well, it's something to consider.
What are you doing?
Ill drive you to the airport.
'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?
you're making sandwiches?
All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.
Well if he's going then I'm not going.
Why?
I cant believe this. So what are you saying? You didnt like my act, so thats it?
Same as you cant overwet. You see, once something is wet, its wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die youre dead, right? Lets say you drop dead and I shoot you. Youre not gonna die again, youre already dead. You cant overdie, you cant overdry.
He was down at the other end. So he yells out, "Ready, On your mark, Get set, " and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.
What? Yo-yo Ma?
Oh, we finished early.
It's against the law.
Ohhhhh, that's great.
Where'd I take it?
Boy, am I glad to see you.
Well--
We're talkin' federal crime here.
You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer, sitting on his lawn chair with a sparkler)
Here he is... that's the guy! (rolls up window) No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!
We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie.
Kramer, I can't believe we're grave robbers.
(walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!
See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup...
So they have hotdogs there.
Yeah.
But why?
SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?
Well, what happened?
(to George) Snow. Snow, that cant be good for suede, can it?
(to himself) Last one.
Kramer.
Aagh! You come back for your clothes
Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket.
Alright, want to start?
Kramer!? (grabbing Kramer's arm roughly, pulling him back as he's about to knock)
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.
How are these your socks?!
(Takes the bottle from him) Just swallow 'em.
Alright.
Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to begin with! Let's face it. I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's that!
I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!
I wonder what ever happened to her.
Corvelay!
Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.
Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something.
Oh. yeah. Alright. (pushes Kramer and Elaine out the door, then sits next to Sidra on the couch.) So, where were we?
Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it.
Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.
So, you're using Frank's relaxation method?
Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?
Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.
Ah come on.
Yknow Im sorry you had to leave so early the other night.
(nodding awkwardly for a moment) All right, I think we're done here. (Jerry leaves and Phil shuts the door darkly)
20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.
Ruthie Cohen?
All right.
Don't blow this.
Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh...
No no, it was no joke.
Wow
So know every time you get dressed. You are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer.
First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?
Yeah...
Take what?
You got lobster for everybody?
You werent?
No I dont see it.
No. You?
Well, either you see him or you don't.
So think you can handle this?
I just got the most bizarre message from you father, Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!
So you didnt ask?
I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
All fathers are intimidating. Theyre intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, To hell with the world, I can make my own people. Ill eat whatever I want, Ill wear whatever I want, and Ill create whoever I want.
Really?
(Correcting her) Edmund Fitzgerald.
'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'.
So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.
Is that my paper?
No, I don't.
Hey.
I dont know how Im going to tell him.
Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they want
Sure.
Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! (Kramer enters.)
Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened.
Yeah, so.
What kind do you use?
Well you have to.
He really did an amazing job. Look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid! (Jerry opens refrigerator.) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups! Come here, look at this. (He gets on his knees and points.) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there?! He must be like Rubber Man!
Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?
Well, I don't think I want to date a protg whose mentor is a Costanza.
I know!
What do you think? It's like a poker game?
How does she know Marisa Tomei?
Come on up.
Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.
Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women.
You have a standard fake?
Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.
Kramer you're going to have to face her some time
Maybe that's why she's happy.
Really? I'll have to remember that.
B.L.?
I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)
Assman!
What did you say?
I'll go if someone else drives. You going?
I got the call...!
Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.
Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city.
Aah, French fries.
Aye......
Was I supposed to bring something?
Oh yeah, right.
He should have had a reverse peephole.
Alright, alright, I'll cash the checks.
(examining the label) Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.
Does what?
That was an accident!
What if she sees me?
Yeah, yeah.
Whatever.
Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift. I know, it's a label maker. The Label Baby Junior. Yeah, I hear they're good. Well, label me thankful. Okay, well you enjoy those tickets. Buh-bye.
He's joking.
Well you can't take her maybe you can't take me either.
And who else is on the show?
So, what's her name?
what's all set?
All right, forget it, its over, Im not moving.
Uh, yeah, I think I do.
Yeah, ya know Cain slew Able.
So the picture worked. Amazing!
All right
I was hoping you'd offer. (The intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?
Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.
Like what?
I would lose that.
Was it in the trash?
Isn't there a deductible?
(Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.
I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide.
(Jokingly playing off Kramer's statement) With a different body.
Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full.
I guess I would.
What?
Hello,  oh hi Elaine .. what's going on  no he just left  you broke up with him?  ME TOO .. what happened?  oh smoking you know you're like going out with C. Everet Coope  me  nah  I couldn't go through with it  I just didn't feel ready  so what are you doing now?  Oh, great idea, I'll meet you there in like thirty minutes. Okay bye.
Your trench coat in my closet?
Hey, George, you know Tim Whatley.
No. Jacket and tie no cape.
I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?
Aahh!
Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.
You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.
Counter.
There was no mistaking it?
Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't get any oxygen.
Another friend?
Why can't I be bombable?
I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine!
I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
I don't even know if I remember the number.
Ah, George turned it down.
(Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.
Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.
How does that reflect me?
Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)
I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.
(on the phone) Hello? No, Im sorry Bania ... Im not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye.
Plus, you know what else.
I said, "and more."
Ah, very good.
What happened?
(to George) Hey, there's Pat. (calls) Hey, Pat.
Actually, I'm drunk.
(into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!
It's not legitimate.
Well, communism didn't work.
Larry, wait, you don't understand!
Oh, I'm sorry.
You feel better?
So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.
You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars.
Yeah, he's a real phony.
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why dont you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin anything?
Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!
Yeah, it is.
No thanks.
I can't ... I can't
I was out.
Hey!
I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.
Is this a repeat?
Im meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.
What are we doing out here? Aren't we going to go in and eat?
Alright, I'm gonna get this. This looks good.
Yeah.
All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now.
You got sorbitant sesquioliate?
Shut up, you old bag!
[rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your point!
I said luss. Im at a luss.
Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?
Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.
Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this, now she's got nothing.
Yeah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.
What?
Ah, who are any of her losers?
All right Ramon, Im going to get going.
Yeah, she's got a big nose.
(to George) Problems with the house guest?
He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught.
Do you see him?
So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new guy, in a big pot of love stew.
All right, the whole elevator business, let me just explain-
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!
(weakly) I dunno
Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.
Bathroom uh, bathroom's uh right over there.
He'll dispose of it.
They're only comfortable with *their* equipment.
What you do say about a guy like this, huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. But your loyalty is beyond question.
Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.
Ow. Stupid fold-out! Why'd they put the bar in the middle of the bed?
Because you know we used to go out.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!
Oh hi.
I admit it. I don't watch it.
Today's not cold.
(smiling) Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.
Are you sure?
Good morning.
(Angered) Hello.. Newman.
Me? What about you?
Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.
Holland *is* the Netherlands.
... um ...
I'm asking!
Used?
You're lucky they let you drive a car.
Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am  rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give...
Yea, that's no good.
(CONT'D) And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.
So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth? (Elaine laughs silently)
Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
I don't know. Where have you been?
Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it.
Oh, Phil... Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry.
Hey! Did you get the Volvo?
Nothing.
I got a haircut.
Look, my friend saw you.
Nothing's happened.
Eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
All right.. Go ahead.
Is she nice?
Thank you.
Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other line. Just a second.
I didn't--
You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?
Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle.
Why don't you just come over?
Yeah, well that relationships really got a lot of potential.
No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
He didn't make it.
Okay.. (Opens the door to a frantic Elaine)
Yeah, well I don't trust this guy. I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.
Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it is. (vehement) Just take it!
Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, George Louis Costanza. Here I am about to go to the electric chair and my oldest friend is dating the governor
What blah?
Yeah.
..Yeah.
Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?
I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
(on phone) Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil.
George?
(Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) It'll be on your conscience.
Well, that's garbage.
Boy, he took it hard.
So I said something.
Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!
What's in?
Relax, hes late. Hes always late. Its part of his M.O.
It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
Sit down! Sit down!
All the time?!
I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, "Didn't you see my signal?" "Look at that fender!" ..Then you'd see a real fight.
Just, uh, plop it on the counter there.
Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, you were right. I'll do anything!
Why, what's wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders)
How you doing?
What are you telling him for?
Am I finally getting a baby brother?
It's kinda old, isn't it?
Okay.
You're making a big mistake, Joe!
Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
What's with you?
No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver.
It's just a drawing.
So what about the "Maestro" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.
So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)
He'll be here any second.
It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.
I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, Well, its ruined. And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, Its not our fault. Were not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation. You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? Theyre cleaning our clothes, but theyre not getting anything wet. Its all dry. I know theres gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that theyre using. Theres no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (Jerry brushes off his shirt.) Thats dry cleaning. I dont think thats what theyre doing back there. They dont have eighty guys going, Come on, hurry up! Theres a lot of shirts today!
Thats the bet! (The phone rings; Jerry answers it.) Hello?... No- oh, hi... (Kramer leaves) no, they just left... Oh, my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch em. (Jerry goes over to the window and opens it; calling out the window) Ma! Ma! Up here! Dont get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!!
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.
In two days.
We'll be outside
Because you were too busy stealing a book.
Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.
You were very nice!
You stink. You know you stink. What is this?
Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.
You don't like her?
I reckon.
So you do want it.
It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a "Tada!" gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say "I'll see ya.", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)
(Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..
Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss.
Bit you?!
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese. (buys a newspaper out of a machine)
What's going on here?
(Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?
Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here. (pointing up and down at George)
So, you and Lyle are roommates?
What?
How ya doing? (George nods) Can't talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his brace) Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his eyebrows) I like that. (George sticks his tongue out) So how's life without tonsils? (George quickly indicates with his arm that he wants ice cream) What? What's that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?.. (George signals that it's more) Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy.. (George motions for ice cream again) What are you doing?
Why?
Alright, we're coming down.
It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.
Always works?
I know! What are you doin' here?!?
Yeah.
What?
I dont have any plants.
(pause. Stops tapping his leg) 'scuse me?
Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?
I can't believe this.
Well, Im sure you did. Who wouldnt love a pony? Who wouldnt love a person that had a pony?
I think that's a little extreme.
Yeah so?
(agonised) Uugh! Ahh.
Oh.
Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.
All right.
No, no. It-It's really funny. There's these two guys-
But that guy has my jacket.
Kramer! (tries to hide he's upset and jealous)
She's got nice calves.
No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing.
What are you looking for?
I think that's a "what's good for the goose is good for the gander".
Y'know I hear that all the time.
Yes, it is.
Do you even know what this scene is about?
Toilet paper's changed.
You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.
Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.
All I said was "I like the pen".
Poor son of a bitch.
Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?
Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those orange cones you have on the throughway... (Sees pilot) on the way... up here... um... I..
All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry.
Are you taking the Tony to Sardi's?
Nah...
Yeah, Ill see you.
(pause) Yeah, I guess.
No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me. She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised what's going on.
What's the matter with you?
So I assume the jig was up.
Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?
Sounds like a really cool fort.
All right.
Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
Hi.
You're passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago!
What are you doing here?
Yes I was.
Well at least you and I are okay again.
(Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So, the last person in should close the door!
Raymond?
Well, maybe it's a good thing.
You don't have to, really.
You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.
Oh, no way it's that big.
Hey, so where's my sneakers?
Absolutely. Let's just stick around.
Oh! you just startin' now?
So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.
Why can't I be a soul mate?
Thank you very much, that's great- >click< Oh! Hold on a sec, I got a call on the other line. >click click< Hello?
Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
No thanks.
Yes, yes, he is.
What?
You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.
Lannie, how was the trip?
At a rodeo. Where's she moving?
Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit.
Oh whatta hell is goin'on?!
Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?
What?
Hi!
Oh, it's nothing...
(to George) No. (to Kramer) I told you not to say anything.
The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.
Oh.
It is a good idea, Elaine.
What do you mean?
No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.
Cmon, cmon, go ahead, move up.
Weight? Naw. Just need some more height.
Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car so I don't toss it in that dumpster?
You did?
But I thought things were going great.
So, does he like you?
They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.
I don't know, opera, it?s not my kind of thing.
Why?
From what?
Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?
Cranberry juice?
On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?
I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are gonna be so sorry!
I cant believe it! This guy ripped me off!
Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye.
Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.
Well, should we leave?
Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.
Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..
Anyway, I don't need your help. (Turns to leave.)
Where you had, uh, wooden teeth.
I know you will.
Bye!
I dunno, it was an impulse.
Oh, I don't want to bother you.
No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.
Nah, forget it.
You're kidding.
Alright, come on, lets get out of here.
Yeah, there's some sickos out there.
(Making nothing of it) So? Who cares about that?
All set. We'll just grab the bags.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
What for?
Me.
So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?
I love these nature shows, Ill watch and kind of nature show, and its amazing how you can always relate, to whatever theyre talking about. You know like youre watching the African Dung Beetle and youre going Boy, his life is a lot like mine. And you always root for whichever animal is the star of the show that week -- like if its the antelope, and theres a lion chasing the antelope you go, Run antelope Run! Use your Speed, Get away! But the next week its the lion, and then you go Get the antelope, eat him, bite his head! -- Trap him, dont let him use his speed!
What?
A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?
Ya, what's there to talk about.
I don't even know what you're talking about.
Yeah, but now Im nervous.
Of course I can, am I being funny now?
Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?
Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.
I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club...
Oh, big fighting marlin. (Jerry acts like he is catching a marlin)
I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.
How did you get in?
You?
Shes waking down the street and it hit her in the head!
Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.
Cause Im an idiot! You may think youre an idiot, but with all due respect, Im a much bigger idiot than you are.
New clothes?
There's a giant parrot in the hallway.
Hello.
(doing the voice) No-o-o-o.
The washer fluid is fine.
No I don't.
the usual
I saw it.
He might die.
We're doing fine. How are you?
Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
So you want to catch a movie later?
Hey, Ray.
It's hard to say.
Never?
Oh, when did that happen?
If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld.
Ready to go Lois?
John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.
Come in.
Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god. Wel-- how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud.
With her hands.
It's inhumane!
(giggling)
Hi Bob.
Shell call you back. Youre overreacting.
I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, "Oh This is so good. What's in it?" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not.
Walk me down to the Friars.
You are NOT sending me fifty dollars!
(Blunt) I believe you.
(reading) 'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie, hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'
Aah, top of the fridge. Hey George, I'm taking that waitress to the Tony's.
All right, I'm, i,m takin' the camera.
Oh, you didn't see it.
Maybe it's a shortcut.
That's alright, I got it.
Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them.
Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys.
What else?
Well, um same bed ...
All right lets go. We'll meet you back down here in ten minutes, hopefully with the money.
The ticket is worthless.
I didn't know you had a hopper.
(to the phone) Hello yeah yes it is really ah, ah Could you hold on a second? (to George and Kramer) Hey listen to this, some woman found an electronic organizer, my name was in it, she wants me to help her track down the owner.
So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?
But they not you arent handicapped, arent you ashamed?
She never sees the big picture.
How can you talk to someone like that?
Well I don't want to take too much off.
I guess we'll never know.
Why?
Yes, I do.
Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.
Okay. No calls the next day.
(pause) It's your third day..
The Improv is playing "Rochelle Rochelle" The musical.
I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You know (does the motion for the check) Check, Check. Unless the waiter isn't too shape then you gotta total it up. Sometimes they come over, "Do you want the check?" No I wanna be pen pals, can't you see what I'm doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people.
You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!
So?
Wow! Zanadu . No wonder youre putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) May I?
Yikes!
Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.
You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.
Thanks.
Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, "Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms."
did you say flinty?
Yeah, and, (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly exiting) time.
And what's with people getting sick?
I've never been called breathtaking either.
I didn't know she was married.
Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.
Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets.
Of course.
(Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in.
Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease?
Well I do.
It's just hair.
Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?
It's a pig at a complain department.
Yes. And the mentor advises the protg.
how can u say things like that over the phone?
Oh, I'm gonna puke.
(looking at Kramer) This is nice.
Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this? (moves his arm) He's gonna think you're a mental patient.
Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.
(Leaving) Right back at ya, Slick.
No, no, no, no.
Great, you're lonely and miserable again. (presses button to call elevator)
W-w-wha' you got in there?
Yeah
No I gave it back to you
We're acting. (they stop laughing)
Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George.
Prognosis Negative.
Thanks. It's Hounds-Tooth.
Wow! that's incredible......But you don't draw.
I was blowing on the coffee.
Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?
Okay, I think you're in love!
I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.
So?
You didn't have to push me.
(Trying to shut him up) Kramer.
So youre sure youre not still angry about last night?
What are you talking about?
Having a cup of coffee.
No, no, no, another race - out of the question.
I did not!
George - could I have a word?
(cautiously) Who is it?
Faux pas.
No, shes a little too cheery for me.
That's final!!!
Jenna's like me. She's very... (searches for word)
(Once again, the audience hears his thoughts) I'm so car sick. I'm gonna vomit!
This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-
You got the tap?
All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.
Well, yeah...sure.
(to the Barneys sales associate) Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?
Was it eaten?
I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing.
And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
Alright.. (Heads for the door, grabbing his coat)
To be polite? You are insane!
Well, how come?
I'm not in the mood.
You can barely see her face.
I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..
Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.
Hi, Louise.
Shake is bad, but what if its the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?
You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didnt take it. (pointing to himself) This is an idiot.
You need an exterminator?
Elaine, have you been talking to her?
What?
You too.
I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.
The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
Hey
paper goods?
C'mon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine)
You never really had the right comeback, anyway.
...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.
Elaine, how about this shirt? Is this okay?
So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.
Sure!
Should I?
Uh-huh.
Write it off what?
Thats your big boy.
How long do they usually last?
Yeah, that's your thing.
Risk management?
Ok, see you later.
Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.
I don't think you are.
Hey, would you stop it already?
Do I have to?
Really? How?
. . . it's uh, being fixed.
So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.
You know I can't get this *damn thing* to sleep. (about the Yo-Yo)
(hearing the noises) What's happening!
Great, its yours. I can't stand the sight of it. Elaine, heres the car keys. (tosses her the keys)
What?
I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example.
George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments.
No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.
See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think?
THIS is your hiding place?! (Elaine laughs)
I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.
Why?
Geoffrey who?
And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.
Stop being so concerned with looks.
What, she gave me hives?
Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.
Then he asked you out?
I don't feel so good.
What do you do?
And you are?
Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.
Oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh that's terrific... Mulva.
No!
What stuff?
Elaine's writing a "Murphy Brown"?
George is taking it.
Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.
The Daily Worker has personal ads?
Like who?
Why?
Head to toe?
Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.
Okay, starting...NOW!
(adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.
I kinda like this opera crowd, I feel tough... Anybody else got a problem?
No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?
But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.
Is there a box spring?
(thinking) I cant believe it. I got nothing! I dont even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...
Yeah and...?
Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?
Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot.
Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!
Why not?
I am not gonna taste your peach. I ate some one's pecan last night, I'm not gonna eat your peach.
Yes I do, Kramer.
Ho ho!
Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,
Yes, and I returned it in 1971.
Sid left the keys in the car.
All right. (goes into his hallway and comes back) You got my fins?
(looking outside) Hey Newman, is that your red car?
Great - I won.
All right, I'll see you after school. I,,m late for Hayman's hygiene.
I can't wait.
No.
Susan! What are you doing here?
(like a frustrated child) Why can't I know?
Well, this is great.
Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.
Yeah!!!
Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?
What happened?
(before disappearing himself) Punk.
I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.
Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.
So who's the new you?
Let go!
(disoriented) How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?
I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers.
And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.
(uncomfortably) Nothing.
It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.
He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it.
Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman...
Ya?
Hey, are you still wearing those things.
What's with you two?
You're a shmoopy!
Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, its with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I mightve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.
I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a riot.
(getting out his wallet) Uh, one second.
Can you believe it?!
Well, you gotta wean.
(examining the button) Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like a tooth.
No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex.
Oh man...
So you're pretending to be a tourist?
I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it.
What did she say?
Yes I know, I know.
I'm telling and you can't stop me!
Are we finished?
Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..
So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?
Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.
What do you think?
I don't know, but you don't have it.
This is going to be a shame.
"Just one....gotta go back.....Oh but get this. Elaine, you will appreciate this. I'm sitting in Tim Whatley's waiting room...He's got a Penthouse right out on the table."
That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen -
(as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.
and that's why you're going out with him
I'm banned?!
It was a mix-up, I'm sure.
I'll be back on Monday.
(Smiling, like a salesman) All right. Now, what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today?
Get your finger out of my face.
But the question is, are you still master of your domain?
No.
Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.
Why didn't you shave this morning?
"Greatest Show on Earth"!
What the hell is this?
No, hes It. He wins. It is good.
Come on. Come on.
I'm a joke maker.
Oh now I see. (Buzzer) Yeah.
No, but ah, seen any good movies lately?
(overhearing the other two) Oh, no.
I dont think so.
She did?
Oh, whos gonna know?
Phone call? Who knows I'm here?
Well it's been quite a night I could sure use a cup of coffee.
I dont give out bites. I got another one. But Im saving it for later.
And you misinterpret this how?
Dead?
Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it!
Hey!
"Kom Pau(sp?"
Well, I guess I gotta go, too.
Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.
[Into intercom] Yes?
I know.
(grabbing the list from Kramer) You're not getting any plantains.
Big accomplishment.
These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you?
Just keeps on getting better and better.
I don't know...
Couple of interviews.
I don't think it's that bad.
Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
I don't know.
Well, it was the best of those movies.
I got an idea.
Disgusting?
Hey - how was the beach?
So you called.
How much is it?
I didn't know it was possible not to know that.
We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.
Well..
I don't know.
Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car!
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--
(Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla.
I have no idea.
Boysenberry, Huckleberry ...
Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.
They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
Vanessa, thank you. Ive been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.
(Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.
Come on up.
Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I never know what to write on these things. I hate doin' this.
Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. (pretends to pull hair out)
Oh...
Shell be furious.
Ah, you know. Im supposed to meet, eh, someone -- Ill, Ill wait for them outside. (walks towards the door)
So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?
Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night.
Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.
Theres one thing I dont understand. Why does it please you? (to the phone) George Costanza, please.
No eight years isn't such a long streak.
Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.
You got a little problem.
All right were coming down.
She's out.
(takes the card from Elaine) We had a little fight this afternoon. (reading from card) Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe.
He took It, Out?
I don't want it.
What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.
She's the model I met on the plane.
You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married.
She's nice.
Well Biff/ What's next?
He's eighty!
Yeah.
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Although what if its one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?
Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?
Positive.
(throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?
Which part? The renovating the restaurant you dont own part or spending the two hundred million you dont have part?
Fabulous. See, now you're really do something.
All right. (opens door - Red light floods hallway - a buzzing sound emanates.)
A circus?
Ah, it's just money.
(Pleading) I tried my best!
But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.
With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.
An inch! Can you move over an inch?!?
Why?
But you did actually throw his coat out the window.
Oh! man did you see that. I ate discarded food.
We cold play Sorry! We cold play Steal the Old Mans Bundle. (Vanessa not amused; Jerry thinking) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to Vanessa) What kind of perfume is that youre wearing?
What about you?
She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.
He's the same!
(after Bookman exits) That is one tough monkey! (turns to Elaine) So you were saying?
Religion, my friend, thats what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that its going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.
Ouch.
NBC!?! Give me the phone!
Why don't we just rent a movie?
Yeah.
Aaa. Well ... you want something to eat, don't you?
(to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.
(Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.
No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's.
So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh?
I paid what it costs.
So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!
I don't know
What do you mean you're in the same class?
No, Ill go. Im going.
(looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
I know, I know...
Hair?
Come on, Kramer, get out of there.
Hey, Jeff. What's happening?
He can't handle the truth!
Yeah, all right.
You know what room Testikov's in?
Yeah. Kramer made it.
Oh yeah.
(sarcastically) I know!
She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing.
I think you scared me straight.
Because I was standing here, that?s why.
So what are you gonna do?
So are you gonna get him a chair?
George!
Fourteen thousand.
Really?
You mean stakeout the lobby?
Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet.
(scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.
(Singing) Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!
Standard. Micro.
Unbelievable!
Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?
So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was just wondering if there were houses there to rent.
Audrey?
I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.
Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, No egg white omelets. Look at that.
oh.. Jane she uh.. she uh..
Oh... oh... wanna get some pizza?
If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.
(surveying the restaurant) Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it!
So forget about your clothes.
This is not a good time.
Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit?
(continuing unphased) You wanna get the other end, cause I wanna get it in the hall.
(To George) What's the matter?
What are you doing?
All right.
Yeah..... He caught me So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend to look at the coat.
We don't know!
Hey.
Okay.
I think we're still a man short.
(gesturing) This is Gary.
I don't know. Blind date?
Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.
This weekend. WOW!
Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.
Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.
Oh my God!
But?
The timeless art of seduction.
Hi.
Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.
Oh my God! The break-out/pop-in!
Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.
All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me.
(Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.
All right! I'll do it. The race is on.
Did you hear something?
Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?
Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.
Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count on me! (hangs up)
Hey.
No hello?
Why *is* that?
Hey Doc, check this out. [does an around-the-world with the Yo-Yo]
Ok.
Oh... Why Fusilli?
No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.
I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.
Isn't it common knowledge?
Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. (To Kramer) I never should have cashed those checks!
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you dont have to be home on time.
Fine...
Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.
I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?!
(Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything?
What's stopping them?
I-I'll tell 'em
Well ... ok, I guess (voice trailing off)
..What about the Van Wyck?
You must have quite a time down there.
So you like her?
We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?
What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?
(quiet) Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..
Never mind.
What?
Hey, hey. I understand. Youre businessmen.
(hits button) Come on up. (opens door a little)
Have you said anything to her about it?
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye. (Hangs up) Hey, I'm flyin' first class.
Nooo.
Yeah, tomorrow.
It's been years!
Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.
(agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!
Right.
Elaine? How did you rope her into this?
Still with the neck hole?
(to the phone) Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my moneys gone... Well, call me right back. (Jerry hangs up.) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasnt been home or in his office in the past three days!
Well, what is with you?
Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.
What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one.
Hey.
(His thoughts) I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver.
Bob.
What are you talking about?
What do you need it for?
Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful.
Yeah, that's him.
Huh? How you feeling?
Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.
( embarrassed laugh) ...Oh! Damn..
All right.
No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.
Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!
(Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.
Puffy.
You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.
Uhh... no.
Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give it back to me.
I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.
What?
Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.
Hakuna Matata?
We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked.
I'm not having this conversation.
No.. you?
Well, you want your organizer back don't you?
Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?
...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana...
You can't take that chemist out.
(shock) What?!
Really.
A uh, a person that uh...
Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
Oh, beautiful.
Yeah, it's funny!
Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?
I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.
You sure you don't want the tickets?
Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.
See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.
Hang on just let me pick up a paper.
Well, ...
Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned it...
So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?
I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..
Good idea. (phone's ringing, goes to it) (muttering) There's a beach towel on the rack.. (to phone) Yeah.
Yes he did.
Well, you picked out a rooster.
Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.
So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.
Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer!
A Long Talker.
All right, Elaine but this is beyond news. This is like Pearl Harbor. Or the Kennedy assassination. It's like not even news. It's total shock.
I sure do miss my apartment. Maybe I'll switch back.
Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.
Am not.
Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.
No, we're having an intervention
Inside the van?
But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.
It's impossible
Scared the hell out of that guy.
I got a date with Nikki.
C'mon Ponytail ...Get real.
I mean, let's say we did.
Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?
How do you feel?
Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.
All right, she said she couldnt find a decent hotel room...
Hi, I'm Jerry.
Theres nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.
Hey!!!
(pointing toward the guy) See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.
Oh, oh take it back. Let's get another one.
Hey. How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?
Yea.
Im just so glad its back.
Okay.
Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted.
I know it.
Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!
What did you say to her?
That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.
No, I'm not...
Drawer.
She's playing, Pagliacci?s wife, Nedda.
Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts, so he killed him.
Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.
Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.
Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.
All right (picks up his sports bag)
What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what they're saying.
Everything.
So tonight are you going to make the move?
Does it matter?
I don't know.
Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And Ill need that in the form of a question.
I read.
No I didn't.
Okay, I will.
Yesterday. Six-ish.
(louder) Hey!!
No.
People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean, it's only this wide!
(doing the voice) Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!
As we all do.
Yeah.
For crying out loud, He's Superman. (Fulton stops laughing, Jerry's face is stunned) Fulton? (looks at him) Fulton?
Yeah.
Oh my god!!
Yes!!!
Aah! .. right. The ones from Oregon that are only ripe for two weeks a year..
You got a raise?
I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.
I don't have it. You want half my omelet? (holds his omelet plate up to Bania)
All right, sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) George?
Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?
Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!
What's that?
A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?
I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? (Kramer comes in) A real dermatologist.
We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.
Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? To me tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. "That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh."
No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls.
Mmmm.
Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
Oh hi, Katie.
I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.
And where does it end? Then everyones doin it. Its like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, "Dont go there." - Someones gotta take a stand!
Nothing, nothing.
Shower?
This is my friend George.
Yeah!
You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.
Good for you.
Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.
(walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.
So good for you.
Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!
Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?
Never mind
You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand?
But he's an old man, Elaine.
No. I'm fine, thank you.
It does other things!
Yeah.
Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?
Flying Sandos. Beautiful.
Hey, where's Marcy?
(Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
How good?
She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!
Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)
Give me that wave!
So I know this guy. Im getting all my sneakers at a discount now.
What are you looking at? (Kramer goes out onto the terrace and looks down.) Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold.
Well? What do you think?
I read it in Ann Landers.
I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.
Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.
Well I, I can't believe this. I know Phil, he, he's a good friend of mine. We play softball together. How could this be?
Well what is it?
(Stopping him) No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!
Oh, and who might that be?
Really? I thought you were rebuffed.
His illness is your business.
Give my best to Hinckley.
Yeah.. When he's dead he'll be relieved... Oh by the way Viking Press sent a Fedex for you to my parents. They brought it with 'em.
Oh, see that's not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people.
That light!
(doing the voice) Good-bye Kramer.
I guess he graduated.
"I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery."
Well George is an idiot.
How 'bout the march out?
Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!
You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.
Okay, great.
Oh, good idea...
Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.
Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something?
Yeah. Okay then.
I'd be very interested in something like that.
Speak of the devil.
Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?
Nightmares. You?
What I said. Ive been under a lot of stress.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON UP (Jerry puts his head down - he's not looking forward to Kenny Bania)
How would we do it?
Hey, how's he doin'?
Do medical schools actually do this?
He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.
Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.
And you're the model for this perfume?
What is this? "Murphy Brown"?
(Points at Elaine) And the indigent.
Like that (snaps his fingers)
[quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!
Good. How tall is she?
What's up?
You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.
Back on the rack.
(to Leo) Uncle Leo.
All the time. Ive been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I cant live like this. I dont know what Im gonna do. Im heading for breakdown! (to Harold) Cant you do something?
You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!
Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?
What, Elaine?
What?
Hey, Assman!
"Atomic Sub"? Why are you eating there?
What?
Get outta here!
(picks up phone) Hello? (listens) Oh, hi Mr. Pitt.
It's this one here in the back. (Tilts his head back, and knocks Elaine's trophy out the window. A loud hissing sound and commotion is heard from the street below. Everyone runs to the windows to look.)
My Indian?
Should we walk him around?
What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.
Plus Im wearing short sleeves, I dont want to expose my tattoos. (Vanessa smiles; thinking) Shes unbelievable!
How'd you expect to get out of here?
Nah, I don't wanna
All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.
She'll have a cup of coffee and a broiled chicken.
(handing her a magazine) Here, read this.
I gotta get out of this cab...
The old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go "how do you like crotch?" If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly.
Really? What happened?
Well, what does he do?
That's strange...
You also shouldn't use a donut.
Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.
Really?
How much could you possibly have in there?
What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?
Hi Uncle Leo.
Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.
You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...
Oh... No, that's ridiculous.
Thats not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table repeatedly.) You know, maybe its not that bad an idea.
(Pointing) I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.
It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum.
What's that smell? What are you wearing?
I got you an apartment in the building.
Is that like the end of the world or something?
Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.
And I'm always impressed.
Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary.
Who's that?
Number one?
Good question. (More to himself than to Elaine) Why are we calling?
Franco's no good? ...They got no team leaders.
"Yeah!!! What is that? I mean isn't that sick. I mean , I'd be embarrassed to have that in my apartment."
Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr.
What is it that isn't working?
What are you doing?
No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything off me, first laughs now ladies.
...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're there approving new clothes.....That's a girlfriend job! How dare he!!
Well, I'm gonna do something about this.
(spits the nut) OooH!!! You. you ate these? You sucked on these and put them on the plate?
Something, isn't it?
She reads lips.
Very good
What?
That was July 4th!
...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.
Kramer, here!
Really?
Soon, there's a couple of problems.
Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place.
Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.
Of course. It's garbage.
Comedian.
The driver seems a little put out.
I still don't know what that means.
What did you do?
What would you say if I told you that...
Are you serious?
I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.
No. Thats out of the question.
(aghast) Four in the morning?!
Hello, Newman.
Who the hell is that?
Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...
Well, I guess I have no choice.
I wanna see what's happening.
Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle...
So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?
You should have her work on it for you.
The religious guy?
Well, I like Gabe Kaplan.
Oh, Okay (turns to rest of table) Im sorry, I didnt know what to bring, nobody told me.
Yeah, Ive heard that about wedding bands.
So he's Bizarro Jerry!
What is this?
Art Cor...
Cup of tea with lemon.
They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!
Yeah, dont investigate, dont pay me back, it was an accident.
Well, what do you think the big holdup is?
Well, I didnt uh really mean a pony, per se...
Well, you know. I mean... I dunno.
Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business thing...
Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.
How could you leave a message like that on my machine.?
Hmm.
That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's.
"Don't you see what's happened, he couldn't talk , he's wearing these shoes, he's drooling."
Not possible.
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--
Sure, we can do something next week.
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
I mean, ... if you want to.
I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.
(arriving at apartment, sees Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from Kramer's) So you live right... there.
Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...
Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...
The waiter was trembling!
George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?
Yeah!
Robert.
Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door behind him)
Did you see that?
Oh, yeah.
And yet he continues to live.
He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.
No, no, it was a small ceremony.
Well, not exactly.
Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.
I have no idea.
Yeah!
I know, I just can't bring myself to do it meanwhile that freezer keeps getting smaller and smaller (she smiles) (Elaine looks at her watch) oh, don't wanna keep Tony waiting
Its never happened to me before.
I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.
Schumann. (George stops himself, frightened. Jerry looks around the lobby.) Where are they?
What about, what about this thing?
Why were you making gravel?
Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
(worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!
Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?
No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.
Oh.
Well.
So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?
Of course I was getting you a note.
Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough!
Yeah, he was nice.
Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore...
Plantains?
Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?
Oh, wow.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
Must I?
You know it and I ditched all my junk food.
No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.
Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!
This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.
Well it was my idea.
So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?
What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back.
Star Trek II.
Hi, um. Marla, Elaine.
And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?
Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?
Yeah, I'm soured.
At the zoo?
But I don't wanna be a cowboy!
Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.
Katherine Hepburn? Oh yeah.
Statute.
Dad, it's got lots of other functions.
No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car.
Hi.
Hello Newman.
They're my socks!
I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.
So you do live here.
It's not good.
"Jimmy's got a record. Jimmy's jumping for dollars. Jimmt and George are gonna get rich."
Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one.
So they're like everyone else.
Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.
No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing. (Jerry picks up the phone and dials the number) I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?
Don't worry. (she leaves)
Well we're sitting here together. Why wouldn't you think that.
Oh, Hey, there's a name you don't forget.
Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other?
"Hey! Hey! Watch it.!... You're drooling all over the floor. How much Novocaine did that guy give you."
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
Yeah, sure.
Bad situation.
Great!
so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?
You seemed a little mad.
Yeah, okay. (to Elaine) They may have found the car.
You're a shmoopy!
(whispers) You can't just have water.
If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?
Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.
Yeah. (hands racquet to Kramer) I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it.
What's wrong with her?
My whole night's ruined. I didn't do any sets, didn't do any movies...
You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?
What if I can't keep up?
We'll take 'em!
Drop dead?
We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? (turns to George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George?
Respect, admiration, prestige.
Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. (Faint) I don't care about that.
I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
Well you're not even a fan. I was at game six - you didn't even watch it.
Hey.
Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.
Yeah. I hope so ?!
(Continuing reading) "The Human Fund. Money for people."
So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER
You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal(sp?) before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.
Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Caf Latte?
Darryl. He's black, isn't he?
Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.
Come on,c'mon
They guy's in my house right now. What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.
AH, GOOD FOR YOU.
We had that babka.
(resigned) At least it's show business..
Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
Since when are you treating me to medicine? What are you doing? You're stealing this, aren't you?
I'm not having money problems.
I usually like mine with an angioplasty.
(acting like he was walking on stage) Hey how ya doing? Good to be here.
Woah. (hitting George)
We were ten.
I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.
You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?
So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.
Why are the crepes spraying?
Yeah, but...
Hi. How are you?
Who?
I can't. I'm not an orgy guy.
I'm just not getting any hot water.
Who was in town on a business venture, and um..
Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!
Look Kramer, i-i-if I'm gonna live over there, y-y-you gotta take some of this stuff out. I mean this thing is really freaking me out (holds up a ventriloquist dummy). I feel like its gonna come to life in the middle of the night and kill me.
Sure.
(to the Drake) So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome... (to Elaine) They loved the TV, *loved* it!
And she said "Yes"?
They're nuts with temperature.
Oh, no...
Get outta here.
there are no copies.
Suave! And it's non-fat!
Ate? What? What the hell are you talking about? Now you listen to me, you get out of that apartment this instant. If you screw this up for me I swear....
Maybe he has money.
I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood.
So, what's your first book?
Actually, no.
Are you sure?
So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.
No. So, we're still on to see uh, Firestorm tonight?
You just asked me two minutes ago.
Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up?
Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
Pardon?
What's the matter?
This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.
(answering the ringing phone) Hello?
What's the difference?
Leave it. What about your back?
Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?
Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, "Oh. Tube socks." What are you gonna do about it?
(smiling with pleasure) You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile.
She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply)
Yeah. You almost ruined his life's work.
"You find you need to use a lot of obscenities at the dentist.
How could you say that?
I had a very interesting lunch with GEORGE Costanza today.
If that's Rushdie, they're real.
What?
Oh, I didn't get the insurance.
(not amused) Very funny.
It's been three days and he hasn't called.
Yes. Hes a doctor. (Elaine starts to leave. ) Wait a second. (Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in Elaines purse.) (to George) What are you doing?
Yeah.
trust me.. nah it's good
Another shot, I want another shot.
Your hands were in the dough?
Well, so what should we do?
Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?
To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.
Yeah, so?
Did you shake it up?
You were livin' in the village then, right?
Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.
Im supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?
No problem.
It was sold out!
Really, thank you.
Maybe you're getting' a raise.
All right, I'm worming.
(thinking) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft... (to Vanessa) Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit.
You, you cant overdry.
He let you?
What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?
Is he okay?
(proudly) I am...the master packer.
Manny...
She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence
I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.
Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude.
(positive) Fantastic. Fantastic woman.
Actually, I haven't heard from 'em yet.
That's a date?
Yeah (to buzzer)
What did you say?
How is that possible?
It's on the door.
I was arrested for urinating.
(Saddened) Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.
C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.
Isn't that some kind of safety thing?
What are you up to?
(weakly) A little better. (fake cough)
If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.
I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for him for a second.
Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it.?
There's more food down the hall.
Good, going good (scratches chin) And the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty good - not bad - I gotta get out. (scratches chin, nose then covers eyes with hands)
75,000 lira.
Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?
Oh.
What the hell is all this?
Thank you. Nice job.
Yeah, I guess so.
Get out of here!
Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, "You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"
That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice.
(thumbing through his mail) Uh oh.
Oh, yeah, that. Well...
Remember, don't whistle on the elevator.
What's up?
Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!
Seinfeld.
(thinking; quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
Have you slept with him yet?
Hey.
No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman.
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. ! Celebrate! How about some champagne?
Donna, really, youre making too much of this.
Valerie's not coming over, is she?
Is there a box spring?
No deal. Not hot.
(Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did!
Oh yeah, I knew.
You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...
The poly?
All right.
Why didn't you just ask her for it?
Sort of a mooching inventory.
Nice to meet you.
Mine!
Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?
Come on George, just loosen up.
Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen?
(pause as he realizes) Oh, no.
He's nice, bit of a close talker.
(taking out his wallet and handing over bills grudgingly) Fifty dollars.
Things are good?
You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.
Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana.
(seems sincere) Yeah, I'm really sorry, uh.
What arrangement?
(To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.
Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place.
Yeah, when it's your money, it's fascinating.
30 years.
Here comes one.
Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
(Showing difference) It's apples and oranges..
T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya.
Enough chatting, let's play.
Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?!
Buh bye.
I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.
(C0NT'D) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.
We should get him something.
(to the phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)
It completely turned her off.
Oh.
Yes. I do. You show me where there's a can opener in that drawer. (Answers the phone.) Hello! I'm sorry, I'm just fighting with my wife.
I'm Nelson!
Just break up with him?
Right.
I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
Yeah, that'd be something.
Tic-Tacs work?
..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Packyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of (wipes his brow) pizza and uh the uh and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling em (does juggling motions) he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. (Swallows and takes a breath) Well we all just lost it. (Fulton not laughing, stone faced) It was really really funny.
Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly.
What was I supposed to do? You knew I was on my first date with Elaine. You come barging in here asking me to contribute money for a volcano relief fund for krakatoa.
Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.
(Getting up) Uncle Leo. Hello!
Kramer, give me that rooster!
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..
Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.
So you ask her out.
All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.
Dont worry. (whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!... Its Jerry!... Jerry!... From next door!... Never mind where I am!... Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!...
Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead.
Hello, Charles.
(smiling and excited) Well, here we are.
Hi, Lisi.
You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.
Yeah?
I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. "Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life." Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, "I had a heart attack this big (Holds out hands, gesturing bigness) ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear! (Puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest) Brrhht.. and it's gone!"
Oh, Oh, the IQ thing...yeah.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Poppie's
Come on.
You put that in!
Oh, that's lovely.
See you ... me and Kramer...
Yknow what? This is not that bad an idea.
That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his fathers band. Hed loan it to you.
Will everybody please leave?!
Why should I have anything for say for myself?
I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! **
Hey, how's life on the road?
Oh my god, it's...
I love you, George. Come here.
No, I don't.
Why'd you tell her?!
Why?
I think I may have made a big mistake.
Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.
It's nice to meet you!
I'll be here.
Kramer, what did you do?
The boom box incident?
Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.
You walk around with no underwear?
Hey Matthew.
Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination? You couldn't possibly visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life size snotty puppet. I guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. That's the end of the line for a mannequin. "What ever happened to Bob?" "Have you seen that new Volvo commercial? He's got a bulls eye right in his face." Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, I guess these are the two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves. Well dressed or getting killed. I'm sure there is some pro-mannequin organization that doesn't even like you to use the term mannequin. "Hey they're not mannequins, they're the life deprived."
"Of course.... But that's got nothing to do with it."
(To Elaine) Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get some coffee.
But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!
He might want a show about anything and everything.
(Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not.
Well, after he bit my friend--
In all of Tuscany? I wonder.
Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. (Hands over Kramer's quilt.)
No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.
See you later.
Could you excuse us please?
Yeah? Would you do it?
Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.
Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth?
Yeah, theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.
Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestl's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--
Yes, it can.
Great! (realizing) What?
That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The Mohel circumcised my finger!
I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.
I killed.
Well, is Elaine here?
No, she's not.
You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events.
Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this?
Wow. The enthusiastic hi. Thats beautiful.
What's she like?
Why can't I be normal?
Yeah Why?
We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing.
I'm going for the record.
(pulling on a jacket) Mmm-hmm.
All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!
Dont get up.
It was an accident.
Ill call Kramer. He can check my house.
Well, uh, I uh, I dont want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe its not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.
I think he knew.
Nah, I don't think so.
So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?
I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.
Named Sharon?
Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. (They both walk to the booth and sit down. Suddenly, Gwen is attractive) Now this is a good looking booth.
Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here!
Oh hi Jack.
Five minutes.
Hell have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
You're kidding?
I got one problem. Youre keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that shes coming.
So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.
Then it was trash.
You did, you did.
So you're gonna burn that bridge.
Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?
(Joking around) Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.
Mike thinks I'm a phony.
What do I say if he picks up?
(Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.
I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, "Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me." But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?
Oh yeah? What did he say?
Yes.
Oh, nothing in particular.
Maybe they're admiring your spot.
I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright, I'm dropping you off at work, right?
Yes, I heard you.
Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off.
(answering) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Um, its for you.
No.
So I said to him, "Whatever's necessary."
Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?
Because he's my butler!
Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....
Oh. That's not quite the same.
George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.
I tell ya, I don't see it happening.
(pointing out the obvious) George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him.
Kramer, you're still on the phone?
C'mon, c'mon.
I gave a look?
No, it's not that, it's the...
(Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled "Ori-dent") Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!
Ya i could try and do that.
They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys.
I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright*, I forgive you...
Oh, I'm the doofus?
Thanks, Lyle...
Oh, My god.
Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place.
Why did he fire her?
He took out Kruger?
Yeah right.
I don't want you to call him.
What're you doing with a pricing-gun?
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.
That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
Oh no.
What's he doing? What is his hurry?
Eat something! Babu...
Well you're not Lois Lane.
She said no?
(on phone)Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.... it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye.
Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll *all* be over...
Oh, Babu.
With the smelling.
Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.
Hey, there's the old man! (hug)
Don't spell.
No, no this is more important.
What kind of pie are you cooking?
Why can't I buy my father a car?
(to George) Hey.
Stay on Biscayne.
How did you know I was here?
Ooh yeah, the bags, sure.
Yeah.
Yes
Well, then you're drivin' me wild.
He was shouldering.
(Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.
Oh, like you do.
Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there.
Yes, I will.
I once got Happy New Yeared in March.
Svenjolly.
Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!
There's a naked woman across the street.
Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.
Hello?
Huh. Kurt's an organ donor.
Uh - new car!
Y'know a lot of people have asked that...
The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. Cause it says Waiting Room. Theres no chance of not waiting. Cause they call it the waiting room, theyre gonna use it. Theyve got it. Its all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and youve got your little magazine. You pretend youre reading it, but youre really looking at the other people. You know, youre thinking about about them. Things like, I wonder what hes got. As soon as she goes, Im getting her magazine. And then, they finally call you and its a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. Well, I guess Ive been chosen. Ill see you all later. You know, so you think youre going to see the doctor, but youre not, are you? No. Youre going into the next waiting room  the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You dont wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You dont want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in? Do they scalp tickets to these things? I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two...
It's stuck. (pained) Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood.
Would you?
What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?
Boy, those capes are really coming back.
That Arabian is strong coffee.
No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station.
Well how long you are going to keep this up?
Yeah!
What happened?
Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for?
No, because that's...
SO?
Hey, George!
Elaine? Wh..what's going on?
Well, good night [holds hand out and shakes hand]
A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?
(Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.
Thank you, no.
No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.
So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else in real estate?
I, I had no idea.
Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.
No, a dollar, two tops.
I said yes, but I don't feel right about it. I mean I hardly know the guy. That's a big step oin a relationship. The biggest. That's like going all the way.
Hey!
Yeah.
Alright, alright.
She looks so familiar.
Look at this
Hola.
In your way.
Thank you.
No.
Come on George.
You've got a little rage.
why don't you just break it off with her. tell her it's over
Boogeyman.
Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.
What's that on your forehead?
Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.
Hey whatever happened to Moochie?
Then well just sit there.
I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight.
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed...
I dont know. He said hed call back.
Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off.
I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.
(walking away) Well, I didn't sleep with her.
Thank you, thanks.
Uh, I don't know, we used to go out.
Come on! GEORGE is getting married!
Then who?
You got a little shmootz there (picks something on her sweater)
I know a little.
Give it to me!
Yeah.
No economic reason for them to be here.
Hey, Bob.
That orange dress is burned in my memory
You cant believe what I just did.
So it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato.
I'm having surgery tomorrow.
Yeah, so I didn't miss anything?
She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.
Well, we barely knew the guy.
He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man that's some tart cider!
Come in, we're taking a break.
Yeah, good idea.
Talkin' to Sidra?
I mean it's no big deal. You're still drivin'. You should have been watching the road.
(buzzes Elaine up) Come on up.
(Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing?
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?
George this is Mickey.
Oh, you already gave them away?
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
Kramer wants to die with dignity.
Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.
Y- you're not playin' golf?
Oh! Rimsky -- great great book if I may say so sir. I almost read the whole thing.
Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.
Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?
She's got 'it' written all over her.
What? What?
Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.
Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.
Uh, next week.
Yeah, so?
(to the phone) Oh, its you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldnt have had to do this. Now thats two long distance calls I made to you why cant you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again; to nobody) Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much.
Hey.
Oh. (Adjusts accordingly)
A bad side, an ugly side.
Hey, how was the meeting?
Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.
Duncan Meyers!
Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both killed!
Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage.
I thought your parents were outta town?
Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought.
Amy said nothing happened.
Well, maybe she was disconnected.
Yeah, but John invited her.
Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.
He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication.
Over here?
Yeah. Specifically 930 shows. Seen any good 930 shows at the Paragon, Willie?
Swimming?
Because its complicated. Theres some tension there.
And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.
You may have a point.
(thinking) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume...
What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it.
1409, that's a good score.
Your pants!
Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.
What am I gonna wear?
Ohhh, moisture?
No, hes just a little bloated.
Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.
Oh, he sang like a canary.
What? The Cadillac I bought for you?
A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!
What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy?
Good. How was the roulette?
Right now.
Then we'll make it the eight.
"Well , where is it?."
No, but he's not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR)
It still smells!
But it's your bodega.
You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?
No, nothing.
I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.
N-na I'm paying for the trip.
Yeah, I'm sure...
(Unsure of what to say - he remember's Leo's courtesy tip) Hello?
I'm not taking anyone's side.
Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.
When is this suppose to be?
Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.
He repeated the name of the gift?
Did you bring the keys?
Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago.
True. You mean, for you?
Boy, they really worked on your pectorals.
What about my "questionable material"?
Tails!
Well, where are you going?
Good.
Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen "Girlie" Brown would be very proud of you.
My cable hook-up? What about it?
(Fed up) Alright! Excuse me! (Gets up) I'm not buying any of this!
Hey.
I'll make them later. Uh.
I don't want to talk about it!
There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts.
But we already knew that.
Ah...catalog writer's block?
Hard to imagine.
So, I guess you dont find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?
Are you ready?
Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...
Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay... is uh...
So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--
Tremendous workout.
Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?
I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no.
You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.
...the food court is closed.
Oh yea, I didn't even realize.
Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!
Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will.
Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.
On your mothers life?
Hey!
To the Laundromat.
'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.'
I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?
Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?
[not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]
It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---
He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.
C'mon!
Well I...
Anklets?
Yeah, under the counter. What happened?
Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
I'm a good printer.
Get in there. (he pushes George in the direction of the restaurant)
Well we
Of course.
What is that?
I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.
He tends to exaggerate.
What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him, I dont think were right for each other. Hes a guy! At least with a woman, theres a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.
Why?
Of course, I always do.
You know, I really... Ive come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that theyre just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you dont really wanna see them. You dont call them, they call you. You dont call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you dont really have anything in common with is to pretend youre hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend theres a little desk around you. The only problem with this is theres no way you can say, Hey, its been great having you on the show. Were out of time.
You wanna go with me up to (clap) the Bronx and see if there's any flyers on George's car.
I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I cant stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion wont even exist. It wont. I think eventually well all be wearing the same thing. Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where theres people from the future or another planet, theyre all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided, This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and boots. Thats it. We should come up for an outfit for Earth. An Earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits. No speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, That was nice. I could wear that.
Did what?
George, who is that woman in the stripes?
I...am not taking it.
(derisively at Kramer) Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?
What do you recommend besides the steak?
Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document.
And who were you tryin to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?
George?
So you hurt Vincent's feelings?
What is it?
Ah. But they told us we must go now.
I DON'T WANT IT ....
Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact with --
Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer.
Yeah.
Well, I got to talk her out of this.
(answering machine) leave a message and I?ll call you back, thanks. JOE DIVOLA Jerry, Joe Divola. *Pbt* *Pbt* *Pbt* I have a hair on my tongue, I can't get it off, you know how much I hate that? Course you do, you put it there. I know what you said about me Seinfeld. I know you badmouthed me to the execs at NBC, put the kibosh on my deal. Now I?m gonna put the kibosh on you. You know I?ve kiboshed before, and I will kibosh again.
No, it isn't. I can find out.
I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.
(pointing Kramer) He drank it.
Still got water in your ear?
You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.
What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them.
's not necessary.
Yes Mr. Bevilacqua.
So what?
(is redialing) I should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.
Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.
That's true.
No, I don't.
You can't make it?
Kramer...
Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late.
That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.
You know
(cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You havent been out of the building in ten years!
Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.
Why not?
So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?
Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding?
You're robbing me.
We won't ruin the friendship.
What academy?
(unimpressed) So, what's this guy about?
Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!
Could you stop the counting?
(Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.
Shower?
I hate the counter.
No, not particularly.
You want 'em back?
No.
What's the matter with you?
So you called the cop a pig?
We're not gettin' that TV.
(grudging) Alright.
Cops eating Milanos. What crazy town is this?
Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.
But why? Why McDowell?
and GEORGE Ye, hu, um Ye,
Lemme see if I understand this. In other words, you held out
Yeah, I did that too.
Does it smell like the East River?
It's kind of cozy.
(ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.
Did you tell her you loved her?
Oh no you're not!
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
I long for you?
I love a parade!
Hi.
For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.
What do you care? You don't believe in hell.
I'm sure it didn't move.
(Exasperated) Oh, God
Oh, sorry
Alright.. (Takes his coat off)
What do you mean?
What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?
Huh, wa?
Yeahhh, am I imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and holds it up to Willie) Found this little cutie in the pocket. (throws the stub on the counter)
What?
So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouth-to-mouth.
(trying to shut the trunk hood) Something wrong with this trunk.
It was a bisque.
No, road is a major detail!
Is there, something I can help you with?
What happened to the muffin?
Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits)
Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else.
Where are you going?
Sure.
I think it has something to do with me.
(to Elaine, still joking) He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!
Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex.
Ahh!!! They're out!
Whenever I see the news and they're hauling in some kind of terrorist, psycho, maniac, mass murderer guy. You notice he's always covering up his face with the newspaper, with the jacket, with the hat. What is he worried about? I mean what is this man's reputation? That he has to worry about this kind of exposure damaging his good name? I mean, what is he up for a big job promotion down at the office or something? Afraid the boss is gonna catch this on TV and go "isn't that Johnson from sales? He's up in that clock tower picking people off one by one. I don't know if that's that kind of man we want heading up that new branch office. He should be in bill collection. I think he's got aptitude."
No.
You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs.
It should resolve of its own volition.
Alright, shut up, here they come.
What? Can't I get a moment's peace?
An Army Pete.
Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.
(to the phone) George, whats going on?!
I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you?
When George was growing up..
No, no, would you get up?
I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.
But that is not what they would have you believe.
I can't do those things.
I have aloe!
Hey.
(bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.
By the way, just for the record -
(to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?
When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.
Oh, right... But you *hated* it!
(unenthusiastic) Oh, the gum.
"You're turning in to Jimmy."
What about me?
What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?
(Nauseated at the saying) Would you please stop saying that?!
I just wanna call the police!
(quietly, yet in a high and whiney tone) Well, I don't know if I....
(to George) She thinks it's someone named Raef.
Yeah, you're right.
Hi. Is Phil here?
How come? I told you - It's fantastic.
Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you.
Everything?
Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it?
(tearing through his laundry bag) Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on, let's go.
You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?
Listen, George, little problem with the game.
All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.
How did you do those things?
(reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.
Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police! Some guy just gave me a wise answer. Ask that woman.
Look I really don't know what they're plans are.
All right.
His lawyer.
Let's do it.
What, he doesn't like my taste in music?
Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out?
It sounds like an excellent idea.
(realising) Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. It belongs to the Friars Club.
That's the idea.
Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.
You tip him?
You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about the Costanzas'
Yeah.
Moved?
(to himself) Still a rip-off.
Hey! So, wheres my money?
George Costanza is your mentor?
You're not paying.
Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?
When did you do this?
I can't, I can't take it.
I cant believe what Im hearing.
Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.
He can't just throw me off the plane!
It's not like that at all.
What?
You cant go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.
A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?
Alright, that's enough. (sips coffee)
No, it's part of the contest rules.
Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land.
What is that sound?
You know, what would be great?
All right, all right, I?ll wear this. It's bad enough I?ve got to go to the opera I?ve got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here.
"The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour". I'm confused.
Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.
See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! Then come out with the regular!
No.
What's going on?
What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.
Yeah, I know. There's no call for that kind of attitude.
It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
Kramer!
Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?'
All right, go ahead
What did you wanna be?
I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.
No, I like Mike.
What are doing here now?
(sardonic) Oh. (smiles)
Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun.
(admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.
What if we get caught?
I can't.
I can't go.
You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.
No, really.. an airport run.
Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Just give me a little squeeze.
I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.
Just in time for Amy.
Yes, a man gave you...?
Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerrys office. (Elaine is looking confused). Were going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean hes already left?
Yeah, me neither.
(To bartender) Can I have a club soda? (To Ronnie) Goin' on tonight?
What else did you two do?
Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.
Are we going out?
So?
Marlene.
Why did she give you that?
(Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.
Ill tell you later.
Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something.
'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.
(Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing is now?? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!
Really? Its over?
Projectionists.
Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?
Not today, pal.
(Patting his head I'm a comedian.
Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door)
You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
Alright, well what if we say...
What?
Where are you going?
Couldn't be the guy...nah.
(Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.
What about her name?
Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang"...
What's over?
I don't know what that could be.
If you can.
I cant believe Im gonna do this. (Jerry opens the door and exits the dressing room. He walks over to Bania)
What is that noise?
Hey, I called you last night, where were you?
I cannot take it!
Just talking? Well what's the show about?
What about NBC? Did you hear anything?
Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.
I don't know.
Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. (The door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
Im in for five...
Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series.
Why are you calling my parents?
You want him?
What are you gonna get?
No, I believe it's next week.
Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? That's like half a pound of turkey!
(buzzes her up) Eh. (to Kramer) You know and I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying "my wife." Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - "my wife" this, "my wife" that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence.
So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian...
You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?
I did something stupid.
Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors.
So?
Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.
Could be it.
All right. That's it, I can't work like this.
Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley.
I don't have any change. You've got any change?
Oh, then I'm not worried.
Poor Beth.
But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.
Oh, the dolphin thing?
Okay.
Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said "Too bad he's gay".
Friday night? Nothin', ... now.
Ah, separate knob.
Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.
Too bad.
Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.
Hello? Yeah he's here. (to Kramer) Hey! It's for you.
I was out in the snow last night.
What is going on?
Hey, there's a booth.
44th and 9th.
(pause) Oh. Big deal..
So what now?
I dont get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?
Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.
Wow good plan.
Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?
They really should mention that in the breakdown height, weight, goiter.
Oh yeah, she's dating Bania.
I don't understand what the big deal is.
Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus.
You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem.
I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.
It tastes like dirt.
Satisfied?
This is Amy.
Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.
Anyway, I'm ready to go.
Y-You didnt do anything. Its not you, its me. Its- this is very difficult.
Hey.
That's an open-lip kiss, alright.
Well, I want to sit down.
No.
Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess youre not going in anymore.
How up to date?
Hey, did you talk to the doctor?
You might have.
So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.
No, come on!
Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.
Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.
Dad!
No thanks, just the check.
Thanks, because I would really like... (distractedly puts coffee cup back on the table)
You tell me.
Why? He's harmless.
Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something.
Oh, man!
(eating pop corn) hmm I love this artificial flavoring I like it better than butter I think it's more consistent
Newman! She went out with Newman!
(Mesmerized) What are you, a scientist?!
That's true.
So Miranda's cooled on ya?
(sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there and I will.
You got your shirt in my oven!?!
(quietly) Hey, uh, Milos, I don't mind rolling over here, but could you lighten up on the 'not a man' stuff?
No.
So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club.
Right above me.
(Cutting him off) Thank you very much.
(to Kramer) What's this?
Oooh! Bay-bee *doll*!
Sit down, Elaine.
What about this? This is blood isn't it?!
Hey. Elaine's quitting.
Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.
She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Oh yeah, Sfuzi? I- I've gotta do that.
I there. This is Kramer, and Frank.
(disappointment) Dammit!
Well, you look, uh...relaxed.
(To George) I said I was sorry.
If you don't believe me, ask her.
All because of Wrath of Khan?
That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. Its like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you doing today?
Ask George to go with you.
(From outside the apartment) Hello?
I really have to go to the bathroom.
You raise the feet, get blood to the head.
Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)
Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.
Elaine?!
No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.
I like to use my own material.
Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.)
Were going. Thats next Wednesday.
What is his name?
(Carrying her out, piggy-back style) No, what?
(defensive) No no, that's not true!
You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?
The pop-in.
No foolin'
Kramer called you?
Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?
All right Thanks. Come on lets go
So how was the pie?
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..
Let's go out and celebrate! (they all get up)
Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid...
George! Can we focus on the car, here?
This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?
(To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?
Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?
Yeah.
Who's Cartwright?
(To Guard) I just wanted you to scare him.
The crepe place?
You're going to the Super Bowl?
Did you have a good time?
Casus belli.
He's a boy who lives in a bubble.
Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to an open box) isn't that one of yours?
You should try this.
Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll watch 'em go slice this fat bastard up. (sips coffee)
He can have a donut,
It's Patty.
Are you sensing anything right now?
What happened? Levitan?
Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! (Audience boos)
What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him? I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he?
We'll see about that. (Runs to the window and shouts up to Kramer, who's on the roof.) Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win!
Oh I see they have apple pie.
'90.
Not Pennypacker!
Uncle Leo?!
Tennis, anyone?
And the guy never knows?
Right now.
I'm in the middle of a story.
Good, good, good... What's goin' on?
Crazy like a man.
And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.
Ma, you cant look up words in the dictionary! (to Morty) Dad, shes cheating!
So what do you write, childrens books?
Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend.
How was the rest of Death Blow?
They're busting this guy.
Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.
We'll get a ride.
All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. She's at CALVIN KLEIN's right now.
Yeah.
No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?
(to George) It was a wonderful reading.
Those damn 'I love you' returns.
You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
This guy's belching out vitamins..
What does that mean?
I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.
What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?
Reer.
Theres nothing to get.
Your breath is fine. It's delightful, it's delicious.
That was double overtime.
Hey, Al.
Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.
No good. Too many people know the combination.
Oh! No it's Sally Weaver.
George, here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
It was embarrassing to me.
What you're suggesting is illegal.
Take the keys.
I know. They're not even related.
Ok...
oh uh nothing, she just.. choked on a jujube
This thing has never worked right. (holding the machine in his hand)
No?
Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's uh yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it?
Well, she framed it and everything.
Alright, how much does he owe you?
I can't go until I find my cufflinks.
Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.
That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and-
Didn't you see the sign on the door?
By flying half way around the world?
Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.
The jewel thief?
No.
How am I going to live with myself?!
Oh, beautiful did he like them?
Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.
Okay!
Yes.
(sound of gunfire) Pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, Pkeeew!
And it's about nothing?
Elaine?
What?
I'll pay for it.
So, we're givin' him nothing?
No, thank you.
Yea alright.
Elaine, this is Corinne.
Yeah.
(Shrugs) Oops. (Continues walking along the route, whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street, then keeps walking)
Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school.
A few stitches? I've never had stitches. I'll be deformed. I can't live with that. It goes against my whole personality. It's not me!
(after entering) The bedroom!
I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.
$40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.
Not for another three days.
She's all right.
Oh, hi Brett.
What guys?
Holy cow! look at that!
Here.
I dunno sometimes...
How was it? What'd you talk about?
I've been defaced!
So I guess I'll s--
First we ride the cyclone.
(to the Drake) Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye...
What records?
No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
Thank you. (They continue walking)
Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?
Ah, so, ah, flower shows and, shopping for pretty bows, and then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight?
I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)
I think it's off the wagon.
Any luck?
Somehow I thought he'd be taller.
Hey.
(laughing) What for?
Yeah, I took her home one night  we kinda started up a little bit in the car.
Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.
I didn't know.
Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made.
The virgin!
I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there.
Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?
Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?
You mean you just started sniffing?
No one's going to do that.
Well, why can't you say it?
Between Poland and Morgan?
Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isnt that child abuse?
Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for membership.
Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?
Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!
Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house  and then I saw it in your house.
(Pointing off screen, nodding) THAT I heard.
Elaines thing? How you gonna get in?
Do you want me to break up with you?
I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.
Come on up.
Oh, is this a bit?
So what did you do?
I don't know. 25 bucks a day.
That's it, you gave up?
So, uh, whats your son doing now, Dr. Stevens? Oh, hes a public fornicator. Yes, hes a fine boy...
What does that mean?
You know Dad just called me.
Are you serious?
Ah. I know the chef there.
Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.
It smells like the beach.
See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.
Really? How late are they open?
No, no, no. Just hypothetically.
So you were talking, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") you're having pleasant conversation, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") then all of sudden...
Hey. Look at you. Wha... what's this?
No. Not Chinese. Not even Asian.
Hey, there's the soda guy.
Hm.
This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.
All right, that's not bad. Now get over here!
Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
So you don't cry when your grandmother dies? But a hotdog makes you lose control?
Out of town?
Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.
I know. Neighbors.
They're having sex in the hotel room.
Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.
(Giddy) This is gonna be great!
Absolutely.
You're just straightening up or you're cleaning?
You kept makin' all the stops?
Yeah.
So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought ... What a coincidence. We're just about to eat.
Yeah.
I never said I'd do that.
I'm not sending you the bill.
Cheapness is not a sense.
To the Idiotmobile!
Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?
So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.
The actress?
I don't know what to tell you, Elton.
Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.
No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture.
No, I think the head does most of the stretching.
(Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?
They're hands!
Not as long.
Never seen a picture of him?
Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!
What are you doing?
Oh, you have a daughter?
Thanks.
My bet? All right. Ill open with a tuna sandwich.
What? Nothing.
He invested in it.
C'mon, out with it.
Oh yeah.
Ah, she's with her friend Wendy.
And youre sure the floss was the catalyst?
Oh. (chuckles) Really? You don't seem that desperate.
. . . All right (gritting teeth) Just give me the ticket.
Why'd she get fired?
How do you know THAT?
God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?
They're doing an incredible business.
How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet!
Alright.
You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.
Hum, well it all comes as news to me.
Mulva?
"They get all emotional , they sway. It's embarrassing."
Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles...
With a gentleman caller?
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.
Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) Thats it. Done!
Alright. (Hangs up)
Hello, Willie.
I'll take the first class.
I don't know  he's got some valuable antiques, He's worried they'll break something.
What?
(to George) Was he out there?
What were you doing?
Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
You know my friend Bob Sacamano?
What are you doing? You're choking me. Elaine!
Out.
Yeah.
Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.
Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer!
I don't smell anything.
No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car.
Happy camper , I don't hear that expression enough.
Yeah but theres a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet.
I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.
Now here's another little rule.
Sex... to save the friendship. (Elaine drops her bag, takes off her jacket and walks into Jerry's bedroom) Well, if we have to (un-tucks his shirt) we have to.
It's your Christmas present.
Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle?
You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?
Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.
Um hum.
Any messages?
Lomez is Jewish?
Well, its a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno...
You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.
Tuscany!
What's even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics.
Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?
Take the K-man.
Would she have hooks?
Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before. Your hook is too small. This is for, like, a muffin. All right. Take it away.
So you want to just abolish all home package deliveries.
Hey George, do you believe this guy?
Is not.
What's the matter?
Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?
Oh, my God...
Were still friends.
His eyes look a little cloudy.
Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!
What's wrong with yours?
That is out there.
My parents are moving back too!
All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.
You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.)
Who is it?
The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.
Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!
Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???
Feel good.
Kramer, outta the car. Out, now!
August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress! She never changes! Oh my god. (looking around) She's gotta have hundreds of these dresses.
and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye.
Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.
No social reason for them to be here.
Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?
You can't go wrong with pouty.
Let's ask him.
Hey, when Im driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. Im always waving everybody in. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. ...All right. All right. Ill have a chicken salad.
Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.
We got along beautifully.
On the couch? So you're...
Always helpful.
The dating world is not a fun world...its a pressure world, its a world of tension, its a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I dont know what they need. I know I dont have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one Im- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, were all human beings, what is the story? Ive never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, Ive never been in a situation, when I thought to myself I could use a cotton-ball right now. I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they dont need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, theyre like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? Theyre huge and two days later, theyre out, theyre gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin with them? The only time I ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, theres two or three, that look like theyve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I dont know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl whos left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I dont know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. Lets move on. The dating world is a world of pressure. Lets face it a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance youll end up naked at the end of it. You know? Well, Bill, the boss thinks youre the man for the position, why dont you strip down and meet some of the people youll be workin with?
Ah, just - takin' a little break.
Thats not too bad. Its not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.
Oh, he's having a heart attack.
You faked it? Why would you do that?
Fourteen years down the drain. (points and walks off -- to the bathroom)
And gum.
Yeah, see you there.
Well, once I didnt have dinner until, like 900 oclock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage  meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya? Throw out my garbage for me.
Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut.
WE HAD A PACT!!!
Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.
What are you talking about?
Wow. Look at him. The Yankee Clipper
Ma! Ma! MAAA! (Hangs up the phone in disgust.) Oh, ahhhh (sighs quietly)
It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?
Were you talking? I couldn't hear anything.
(Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this.
Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.
I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?
No, I don't think that..
how's you get her to meet here?
This is how you operate?
O.K. (Kramer leaves.)
Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.
Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up) Since I said what?
Take care
(pause) Not comfortable... (gets up again)
What are you doing?
I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.
You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!
You cant look in there, were playing!
The one with the...(mumbles.)
Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?
It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?
That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.
Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.
I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.
Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?
Elaine, what are you doin' down there?
If only the coin hadnt hit the table.
She's not there. She's doin' her wash.
Because, HE'S my directions.
I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?
Where are we?
All the time.
Well I can see it.
What are you gonna do?
Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.
Please don't crouch.
All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a specimen.
So, you think Clyde told him?
And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.
If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.
(facing the lengthening line behind him) Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.
I'll call an ambulance. (Exits)
Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?
You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?
Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?
It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse "ha's." You know those?
Anyway, you know why I didnt ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab.
How could you not like the Drake?
yeah, it's a damn shame, a damn shame!
[his interest piqued] Minsk?
(pointing) And there's David Steinberg.
Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.
I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.
So, George...
No.
They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again.
What happened to you?
I dunno. (Elaine enters.) Hey.
Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?
They cross the wires or something.
You didnt see him. It was horrible.
George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.
No, I tried it on. It fits good.
Well, she'll still be an ex-con.
Have I ever been less than forthright?
....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together.
I don't know, George.
Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand.
Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.
Are you just screwing with me?
Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.
Really? I thought...
Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, "Hey, they like the soup! Keep it up!"?
Yes it is.
(continues)Like a shrimp farmer....
No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him.
Noit your type?
You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?
You what?
You can't put a paper towel on his head.
The Saab factory?
It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes the door) Give me that back.
Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.
Joe Divola.
You know, Kramer's gonna clean up on this place.
Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?
Well, you know; not everything. I do what I can.
A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.
Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.
Oh! Come om . He'll be over there for a half hour, he gets lost over there. C'mon so what is this about?
Nope. You?
I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? "You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know "No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back."
This is a person I like, its not How to score on spring break.
Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.
12 gauge. Seems to be the most popular gauge.
Ma, I told you, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan... Okay, bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Rava) My mother. She forgot how to make French toast. You know how mothers are.
Of course.
Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.
What song?
This puddle on my sofa!
Uh-huh.
Uncle Leo.
Yeah, that's why I said hi.
You want food, don't cha? (nodding his head up and down)
Fire drill, can you believe that?
Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?
No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.
Well you gotta call your parents.
Now, I should tell you that, at this point, she's under the impression that youre - a - ah
Me? Godfather?
I dont know.
(taking off his jacket) Slaughtered. Wiped the floor with 'em and (hanging up jacket) not only that, the money was unbelievable.
Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.
I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
But what about the messages?
(into phone) Hello Joe, listen this is Jerry Seinfeld, I really think there?s been a huge colossal misunderstanding,
(nods) Look, postcard from Elaine from Europe.
Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom.
(shrugs) Hey George I think I want to bring a date to the wedding
I heard those doves were really incredible.
Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?
Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money?
Eckman? I thought he was doing time?
How am I gonna do that?
Nah. Ill just wear the pajamas.
Aah.
Did you bump into anybody you knew?
He's George!
Yeah, that was me.
(shouting) Man that thing is noisy!
Jodi.
Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!
Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.
(leaving) You two keep an eye on each other?
(Nodding, trying it out) "I'm there for you."
So what are you up to?
Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse.
And here's the beauty--
Well, its a first visit.
Yes, Im lactose intolerant.
Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things about you from George.
Come on up.
Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?
They sealed him up with the mint inside.
He does look like a horse.
(Frustrated, he reacts) Everybodys ripping me off!
He couldn't.
It would be nice to care about someone.
(yell) Move to the back of the drawers!
Hi Elaine.
So, what are you up for? How about Mexican?
No, Im fine.
It's hardly been used.
What for?
No, look, you don't understand. I, I want the picture.
Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.
Yes, that is a definite possibility.
Now, there's a career path you may have overlooked.
Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?
Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.
It's a tell. You gotta tell.
Oooh that. Well...
what's the matter with yours?
I suppose you think your bombable.
Can't do it Newman.
What?
(on the phone) hey Andre, get the hell off the phone!
How come you didn't tell me?
Hi!
Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.
What?
The Bizarro coffeeshop?
(thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.
That woman is absolutely stunning.
A lot faster than that!
Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?
Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.
No, no.
Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.
I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!
It's like Im talking to my Aunt Sylvia here.
Whattya mean?
(shakes his head) I'm very sorry. (closing the door on Phil. Jerry smiles and shrugs apologetically as Phil stares at them through the glass)
No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up?
If there's a serial killer lose in your neighborhood, it seems like the safest thing is to be the neighbor. They never kill the neighbor. The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right? "Oh, he was kind of quiet." I love these neighbors. They're never disturbed by the sounds of murdering, just stereo. Chain saws, people screaming, fine. Just keep the music down. And all these women who always fall in love with the serial killer. They write to him in prison. Here's a woman that's hard to disappoint. I guess she's only upset when she finds out he's stopped killing people and she goes "You know sometimes I feel like I don't even know who you are anymore".
So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here.
So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!
O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!
You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...
Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.
Lip area.
Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.
Dead man walking.
The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?
Well, this is it. I'm really gonna do something about my life, you know? You know, I think I'm gonna call Melanie again. So what if she shushed me. GEORGE, I am really gonna make some changes.
Fifty dollars. I Don't Believe This!
What's the matter?
I'm serious!
Bye thanks.
Yeah..
Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me.
What happened to you?
That'd be the fleas.
I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.
I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy.
And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.
Momentum - same thing.
What?
A bubble?
Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat)
(grunting as he throws bread into the air)
I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!
Hey, why don't cha ask Susan?
As you see it?
Well, then Im not going to the game either. Okay? Ill give him both tickets.
Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is.
The flight's been canceled?!?!
Uncle Leo.
Ok.
I'm off the project. (He exits)
Yeah, let me just stop by the cash machine and I'll meet you over at the coffee shop.
I don't want one.
Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!
I'm telling you, she's good looking.
No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.
Okay, okay. Forget it. Its okay. I didnt mean it.
I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that.
Oh, well, I didnt actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into him there. (putting on coat)
Kramer?
I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals.
He's bringing it.
Cause I hit a whopper last week!
Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in.
No Jon Voight Day, huh?
Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?
So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on me.
You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.
well maybe she couldn't spare it
Yes, we do.
Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?
What's with you?
Oh, no!
Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.
What do you mean they're not going to do anything, they're the cops, they gotta do something, he just put the kibosh on me, do you know what the kibosh means, its a kibosh!
(disappointed) Oh, Hi, hi.
Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about it!
I may have mentioned it.
I don't understand why we have to eat now.
And she wants to break up with you..
Hey, hey.
I don't think so. Why would I do that?
Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.
Ma, will you stop?
Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
You swear?
(a la "Don Corleione") Elaine, never ask me about my business!.... (SHEEPISH) "Godfather."
The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go "Excuse me, I think you missed a spot."
That guy! (Pointing at George) Swarm! Swarm!
Uh-huh.
He yells and you don't get your soup.
Ah, the sweet stench of failure.
But then anyone can just look in and see you.
I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.
I'm right here.
You really seemed to enjoy it.
Monday, I think.
(waving the key) You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!
Why?
Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much. (To Kramer) I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!
We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it?
Filks nothing, but 555-FILM is Movie Phone.
What?
Too sexual.
You're not allowed to have people over?
(shocked) What?
She's on your turf.
Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?
I only have a twenty.
You mugged Stephen Hawking?
What did I do?
Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.
Yeah, isn't that something?
Elaine huh?.. She's completely..
We'll see you later.
Youre movin in, youre a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars. (Elaine is shocked, Jerry opens the door to the hall.) Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I dont even wanna see it, go, get it out.
(Peeved) I don't have any material!
No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.
That's funny, that's funny! "I'm sick of cleaning." That's very funny.
Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.
Solid.
See you later
Hello Elaine? Patty Lawrence had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?
Yeah, come on Elaine, lets go.
Ill give you a year.
240 bucks?
I had to.
Awright, fine. You wanna see it?
We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
Can I take a sweater?
God, you're right.
Well what about the week after?
I don't want any!
Thank you.
(To Elaine) So, the worst is over?
Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.
(testing Joel) So, Im thinking about going to Iran this summer.
He's good, you're not.
I didn't call her till today.
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!
Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.
Yeah, maybe we have.
That's great.
Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.
One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub.
Theyre a comedy team.
What are you talking about? It's my car. Let me pay for the gas.
My neighbour
Well it?s very flattering. How did you get these tickets, I heard they're impossible to get.
No. Come on up.
Eh, people, people are talking.
Yes, I do. (very serious)
Okay. I'll get it. (Goes into the bedroom.)
Good.
How fast was she walking?
Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?
Take it to the window.
What stock?
Alright, let's go.
No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.
So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.
No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!
Oh, Martin!
Hello.
All right. You're in MY face.
I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!
You loaned her Pitt's racquet?
What happened to you?
So, you're just taking off from work?
You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.
Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead.
What for?
No, not on me.
(Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after him!
You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.
No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. Whats important is you two getting back together. Eh, then well talk about the car.
And milk.
Mine too, love the 12 gauge.
Yeah!
I think what he's trying to say is, "get the bouilla-base." (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)
I'm locking the vault. What?
On many factors.
Then can I have it back?
That doesn't work, we'll give 'em Kramer!
Not for me, I love chatting.
What?
Hi. Ah look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna.
Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?
George? What are you doin' here?
Oh, here she comes.
(sits up in bed) Oh what...
"Jimmy"
(Trying to get rid of her) Yes, I think it's a fine idea. Well, good night.
I cant. What if he wakes up?
No.
Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.
You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you... (catches himself)
Oh boy...
And you were integral.
(chewing) Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?
Oh no! >click click< Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!
What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says " Aw, I'll just have some coffee." There's no truth to that.
You said "gloves"...
So what are you gonna do?
Why?
To the door?
to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?
Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...
(Scoffing) Camp.
Aww, right. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it!
Can I try it?
Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!
(interrupting) "Elaine , I really don't...............pay much attention to men`s faces."
Okay, okay. I'll be right back.
He bothers me. I dont even answer the phone anymore because of him. Hes turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.
Oh, don't tell me. 'Cause he's black?
"Jerry"!
Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?
Nice Mohel picking, Elaine. You picked a helluva Mohel!
(exasperated) Ugh.
That old scam.
Some new kind of pie.
So I finally get to meet your pal Joey.
Oh. It's in your eye now.
Yeah, Koko.
Completely naked?
(tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back) Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.
Maybe he didn't know?
Here. Two tickets. Have a good time.
Ehh, nobody listens.
I can't eat this.
[Elaine]
Its very bad.
Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something.
So I really had a good time.
Meat? I dont, I dont know, go... hunt! (Kessler opens the refrigerator and sticks his head in.) Well what happened in the game anyway?
No actually, she took it pretty well.
Well, I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble.
What ever happened to Darren?
In the back, on your right.
You look like you could use a...
(Over the phone) Elaine, youve got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin me on this car, which is yellow now!
Oh, go read a book.
Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?
(Confused) Where'd you get that one?
It's a very complicated area.
(getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.
I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!
What about Puddy?
No in a matter of fact it isn't.
No, no I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like the title and insisted that he change it to "War and Peace"!
Alright, take 'em.
Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered? (Sees the pac) What happened?
Kramer?
Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar.
You're such...
Little buffer zone.
Would you turn that down! What is that crap!
What is that anyway?
So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?
I know, but I'm distracted now.
(thinking) Whats going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, shes too good to be alone. Whats the difference, I cant maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me.
I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
That's the way it works.
What? I'm not looking. Nothing.
(reading, unimpressed) Ohh, 'Number 1 Dad'.
(as Kristin is storming out) Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?
How much are they payin' you?
Of course.
(indifferent) Yeah, we'll see.
Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time.
It was wonderful.
Why don't you go to another nail shop?
Yeah?
Already?
I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.
If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber.
Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.
I should have some reason.
Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?
I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now.
Yes, Mr. Beviacqua
That's a shame.
Yeah.
Hey.
Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down. It's a business.
Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.
Uh-huh.
Ohhh... You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.
All right, all right. Im sorry.
She's got greeting problems.
Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.
Bye
All right.
Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.
I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?
You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it?
How'd it taste?
Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
I've never fixed anybody up.
Oh, well, now you're talking.
How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? Wha, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just sit there going, "Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh, no, another headcase!"
Well, it's kinda silly, but..
Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one.
(animated) Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and you sold a Cadillac?!
We're in the middle of a discussion here.
Yeah?
Hi, Alec.
What did you do?
I'm going.
I will show you The Stooges.
Yo?
Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'
What is so funny?
In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.
Oh! Is that the bald stuff?
What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming "There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!" And then, when they all run into the other direction, we'll jump in the car!
(Sarcastic) You better hurry.
Mmm
Nah, look at this. Cable's out.
Ho-ly!
No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!
Its very good.
By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
Well, Ill tell you what. Ill choose you for it. Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...thats it, you gotta win three.
Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea.
Hello.
Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?
No I hadn't noticed.
I gave a look?
(calls) Hey you two. Im ready to go.
Yeah. Come on up.
Get outta here.
So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?
Alright, alright.
(putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to Sopie's) Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship.
Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.
Good body.
Not (with) that, no..
It's only nine o clock.
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.
No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.
Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.
They're ladies' glasses! You know all you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.
I was just flipping it, it's mine.
Do I know you?
Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?
Do you have it with you?
Really?
This is some FINE mutton.
All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the bottle of fungicide.)
What do you mean, you got it?
Where am I going to look?
What?
Where do they make yours?
Oh, yes. Particularly if youre not in it.
So you think it's a non-vite?
What?
I thought you said you were a good driver!
I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.
Well now we're gettin' somewhere.
Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?
That's terrible...
Gay?
What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog.
Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your guy?
Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck.
Ok, I'll see ya.
Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum.
Oy.
Why?
You what?
There was another crazed ex-girlfriend?
No, she looks completely normal.
Well, I think the whole thing stinks.
(accusing) You're not wearing a shirt, are you?
Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.
Really? Wow.
How could she be smarter than you?
Revenge date? That sound like you more than me.
Probably the reason..
I thought they wanted to settle.
No, I'll crab it.
Pride?
Of course. How are you?
(with a triumphant point) You're busted!
We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.
Yeah, I think I do.
Oh, we all hated him.
Sure.
I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.
This is Jerry Seinfeld.
(Modest) Oh, thanks.
(Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven!
Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
(Pleading) Leave me alone.
Pretty nice.
We're pretty sure.
To a guy you've never met? (mild sarcasm) Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous.
What? Nothing.
What?
She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.
I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.
Whatd'ya mean I stink?
Two minutes.
Kramer, she was murdered!
You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
Lloyd.
I don't believe this.
No good?
(about the cable guy) Nice people.
What is it?
No tune.
Out.
He couldn't handle the weight.
It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck!
How did you get this in here?
But if you go back with me , then I'm not.
Can I have a piece of that?
Tuck in, tuck in.
Yeah
Excuse me?
What?
(Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?
(Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?
Newman?
Why do we have to leave?
See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'.
Fire station?
I think you know my policy.
Hey, board of directors. Look at you!
You what??
That's the point.
What is this?
Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.
Wow! That's amazing!
Be right back. (follows Kramer out)
Oh, then I gotta tip him.
Hey George, there she is again. ...
I could tell you what I did, but you wouldnt believe it. Its not believable.
Come on up. Okay, they're here.
(flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb.
What do you mean?
Spring. Of course.
All right, cmon. Lets go.
Your off-Broadway play.
Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.
No, no, there's no side!
151?
Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment.
"Looks like he gave you some Novocaine"
Everyday is my birthday. (Sarcastically joking off what George said)
Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..
H... G... F. Seat four. One, two, three... f-- Hello Newman.
Are we about throw here Newman?
I'm ready to talk.
No no.
Yeah.
Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?
Why?
Surprise! (he carries in the object)
Went out with George, you?
Oh, okay.
I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
What, are you serious...why, why did she call?
We'll come to work with you.
I think you said driver.
The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.
Where'd you get those?
Yeah, I saw the spot.
Where did you get that butcher's coat?
You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.
Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...
Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men.
Why?
(hopeful) Then you admit it was amusing?
A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the dish and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit.
Krame? Sein. What are you doing? Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island. What are your thoughts about taking a ride? You sure? Okay, but don't leave me hanging here. Okay, great. Let me give you directions.
Uh, yeah. (broaching a subject) Hey uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to a meeting.
I don't know.
What calls?!
You can go with Kramer
The tap is tough.
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.
(after a very awkward pause, cheerily) Hey, neighbor.
I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch?
Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.
Why don't you start in the bedroom?
You know, what you need is a song you can share.
Did she mention anything about our lunch?
Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners.
Yeah!
Oh boy, can you smell it?
Where are they already?
All right
Wait a second, whats going on here?
Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing. Perhaps it's an homage.
(to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.
Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.
Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?
I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.
You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.
Kramer.
I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.
It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.
(Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!
I don't know. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley..."
Uh, nuthin'. Then he took me home.
Wow, what happened?
Hey! I heard the good news!
Depends.
Well, Rabbi, well.
He lives in a bubble.
Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. Im sure theyd just as soon give it to you, but youd have to come up with that money.
You're still doing that?
Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.
They got some sort of program.
Doofus?
I like that. (He opens the closet. Elaine walks out with an angry look.) What do you think, George?
(jocular) You just bought your own dinner.
Ill have the, ah, turkey club without the bacon.
It was just an innocent comment! I didnt know she had a pony!
Hey you know we were just talking about you.
I don't know how long this is gonna last.
Take the K-man. A little support..
What for?
Perfect.
You're still with the pact?
You're a Genius!
Thanks, Julio.
(giving up) Check.
I, uh...well...
Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.
What about Susan?
My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?
You're getting married?
Sure.
Maybe she'll sweeten.
(TO GEORGE) Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?
Hey, where's Kramer?
Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?
Tell me about it!
It.
Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.
I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!
Yeah, see ya. (he hangs up)
(Trying to read the note) What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit.
How can I want it now, if you want it?
I don't know how you do it.
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers...
Ok.
Hey, hey. uh Pamelas birthday party, didnt I see you there? Jerry.
Yeah, over here.
But...
Kramer.
That's great!
Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.
Uh huh.
Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men
Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie "Cinderfella". I got 'em at an auction.
Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?
This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.
And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?
Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did!
No I can't, maybe you're faking.
Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Jerry hugs Kramer, then grabs him by the cheeks.) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think Im in the clear here. Elaines not moving in. I dont have to confront her. She has no idea I never wanted her to move in. Im golden!
Why did you give him MY number?
You're crazy.
Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do.
(Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! A dinosaur!
(having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.
What smell?
What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these, like Superman? I've got to unlock this mystery.
You, you're going now?
What happened?
Keep it. (implied please)
Youre a little paranormal
oh you're afraid he might look like Zippy the pinhead
We do what we can.
So they just gave you this?
I'm not sure, but I think she was nice. (takes a sip of water)
You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?
Okay, Tim. You're welcome. (Hangs up.)
Come on up.
What look?
Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.
It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.
All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.
Beautiful!
It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.
Hard to believe.
Oh, how can you be so sure?
(a la "Don Corleone") Never go against the family, Elaine.
Fine.
You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.
Well, the mans an individualist  he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what hes doing.
I haven't been out yet.
Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the check to Elaine) look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.
Great.
What're you gonna do?
I said yes.
Yeah.
Well, you made me uncomfortable.
We'll pull up another chair.
I only eat cantaloupe at certain times...
Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.
Not you.
Very handsome.
What d'you mean, breasts?
(trying to defuse the situation) Look, no-one is lifting anything.
The female orgasm is kinda like the bat cave, very few people know where it is and if you're lucky enough to see it you probably don't know how you got there and you can't find your way back after you left. There are two types of female orgasms, the real and the fake. And uh I'll tell you right now, as a man, we don't know. We do not know, because to a man sex is like a car accident and determining the female orgasm is like being asked 'What did you see after the car went out of control?'. 'Uh I heard a lot of screeching sounds, uh I remember I was facing the wrong way at one point. And in the end my body was thrown clear.'
Wait a second, don't you--
Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.
(grimaces and takes the shovel back) I'll dig.
I had a statue!
I'm gonna go let Elaine in. (Kramer reaches out to stop him leaving)
Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.
So she was just lying there.
Well, uh..
why do you do that?
No rush.
No, I just had a sandwich.
You sold my Cadillac to Jack Klompus?
Stop your crying will ya?
Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?
Oh well, thank you, Marcelino.
85 cents? That is Outrageous!
Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!
Anywhere.
Oh! (hitting George)
Mm. That's fantastic. (he could care less)
Here we go.
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!
Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.
Where do they ever go on vacation?
Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.
(about the massage)You know I think this is really helping.
How late are the stores open? Im thinking of maybe uh, buying a new TV and smash it over my head.
I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
well aside from that from that, how did he like the sandwiches?
Like you didn't call me a phony?
So she..
Hi Elaine.
(Trying to change the subject away from Nina) Hey - Hey Kramer, what are you doing? You want to borrow something? You want to eat something? Come on in!
Sure. If there cheap Why not.
Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father.
Hey, Kramer, look at this.
Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.
She's as good as anybody else.
Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
I'm kinda in the middle of something.
All right. You know this girl Clare I am seeing?
Seven-eleven?
So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City. I'm performing at Bally's.
So is this a breakup/quitting?
You dont think that I killed her?
Okay. (shuts mouth)
Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon?
Yes it will, now give me those keys!
Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.
I still don't have to go.
Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.
You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-
He cleared his throat?
Don't be alarmed.
When did this happen?
So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.
See, its never as bad as you imagine.
What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!
Im in heaven.
Just go.
Duck, Kramer! Duck!
Well this is interesting.
Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.
George, did you get that chair yet?
If they like each other.
Gotta go. (heads out on stage)
No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)
Yeah!
We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.
Boys, boys.
Whatley. (Like "Newman")
What are you doing?
His father..
Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!
Yes. I do love her. (to baby) You have a very nice place here.
No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?
Well, who took the nap?
Alright.
Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.
I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?
(sarcastically) Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.
Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to 'em. Mind if I walk through real quick?
(still in tuxedo, tie undone) Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.
All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.
Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.
Tony, hey hey (continues fooling)
Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money..
You can't unclog it?
What's that?
The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.
Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out...
You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... (he spots a mailman crouched emptying a box) Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.
Oh yeah? What'd he have to say?
Well, it was sudden.
Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.
Its just unbelievable.
Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh...
I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
"No ,Elaine and I we're just discussing whether I could admit a man is attractive."
Huh?
I can't believe this. A 5-19?
(sarcastically) Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.
Im good, thanks.
Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?
Well that's what's important.
Oh, were meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building.
well, you know, sometimes a square is everything
Hi.
I dont see architecture comin from you.
Oh, hi dad.
Yeah! It's a doodle.
I came to pick you up.
He's gonna show up anyway.
Come on. Something's on your mind. Out with it.
What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.
Yeah, yeah, lucky me. (sips coffee)
I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.
Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.
You know, long dark hair.
Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...
Well, I just want you to know I'm there for you. Course now I'm here for you, but when i'm not here for you, i'm there for you.
What? George Costanza, Frankie Merman.
Hi, sorry I'm late.
Especially that big kid up in the front. (Mr. Pitt is shown on the television, trying to hold up the deflating Woody balloon.) How old is he? (The phone rings.) Hello?
Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there?
Hello.
No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.
Yeah. a-hu. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?
Good question.
That's so strange.
Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)
A virgin.
Yeah, that was bad.
(to George) Keep going.
All right...
Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop, clip clop. They're nuts for it.
(to the phone) No believe me, Im always up at this hour. How are you?... Great... Sure... What time does the plane get in?... I got my friend George to take me...
Not a good sign.
Really...
Yeah , yeah .
But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship.
Uh-oh.
She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing to George) He likes the pop-in, too.
What, are you nervous?
Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?
All right. Come on sit down. It's about to start.
--but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is inadvertently sent an insurance--
You ever find anything?
Yeah.
You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?
Yeah, here.
Karma Kramer?
Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?
Get out of here!
Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?
Hand it over. Pay up.
I cant think about it now. Come on, Im going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.
Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!
I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?
Lemme just check my messages. (to himself) Maybe a nicer girl called.
What?
Why?
So, how's everything going?
Yeah. That's true.
Come on up.
And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's - it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it, and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you. (Nodding)
What's wrong?
Are you sure?
Yes, I would take her out.
No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-
Here.
Kramer's guys?
Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?
No...
That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without the cushy timeslot.
All right. Twenty-five hundred.
No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time?
Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.
I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.
I don't know, up state, Falls, somethin'
W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.
Pam? What about Pam?
(ironic outrage) The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!
There's nothing wrong with my career!
Did you write it down?
Oh, oh.?
The Jujy Fruits?
Well... we should...
Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.
No, I believe he can.
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?
'...downtown.'
Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get in touch with you.
What do you got there?
Yes, A...?
I find the whole thing very embarrassing.
Oh, it doesn't matter now.
Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!
Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph?
(still bossy) Did you just order coffee?
No, they're old cards from my grandmother.
Yeah.
Then what?
Absolutely not.
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.
I didnt tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog?
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!
Yeah.
Gary?
You are not dumb. Don't say that..
Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.
(to Elaine) And where were you?
Well I don't know if I ...
Oh Yeah we went way out and wild.
Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.
It was stupid of me.
Okay.
Oh, I'll split a cab with you.
He doesn't work here anymore.
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine...
When George was growing up..
Well I started to go under...
What do you need me for?
Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. It'll crush him.
I think that would be a very nice gesture.
I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket.
Yeah. Was that a beauty or what?
The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?
Fifty dollars?
She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.
(Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.
Aren't you cold? Where's your jacket?
Yikes.
Pull over? You can't pull over.
I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need "the clown" in his title, as clown? Bozo, "the" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...
Because of Ted Danson.
1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass!
Nah.
Can I just go up?
Oh, you think I'm lying about this?
Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.
Really? Why?
This is Outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit.
Where have you been? You know, you're on next.
Oh, there's no emergency...
She's not beautiful.
That's the spirit. You suck!
I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've been so helpful.
No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble..
So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.
Meryl Streep?
Well, how else could this have happened?
What is the big deal?
So, you won't eat the pizza?
No, certainly not.
If they were fanatic about showers, they might.
Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there.
Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...
We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.
Its good to see you.
Hey is the same thing as hello. What do you think Jeannie.
(Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.
And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.
(raising hand) Faked 'em all.
We're doing sixty miles an hour!
No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum...
I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.
Where are your clothes?
(hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman.
Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.
Yeah, I guess I slipped up.
Yeah, I'll just pay for this.
I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...
All right, what are you gonna say to him?
Its not promised to anybody? Cause shed take it in a second.
We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.
Well...
A velvet scrunchie!
I am. It was the world's first.
I mean, you love Susan, right?
I'm out.
No.
Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,
Hi.
But not here. (They leave.)
So?
Yes. Yes I am! (to Helen) What else did she say on the phone?
Riverside Park.
Yeah!.. Thanks.Oh! my god you saved my life.
For what?
Who are you describin'?
What do you think the dry-cleaners is your own personal closet!
Oh, well, of course. Nineteen-seventy-three.
Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.
Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank.
He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh)
You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.
Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a, its a little crumpled.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.
You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.
What if I lose it?
Theres the giant ball of oil. Clares right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!
Can you blame her?
That looks pretty good.
Where do you *get* this?
Ma, it's not true!
It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.
Oh, it's enchanting.
Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?
It's Kramer isn't it? I knew it!  The greasy door knob the constant licking of the fingers, he's hooked to the chicken isn't he?
I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there.
It's Jerry. Who's this?
You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.
I'm looking forward to it.
Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?
That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.
How's work going you guys?
Hey, Happy Birthday.
She's also quite bold.
You think I'm too cautious?
Also with her hands.
(Looking toward beach) Oh this is interesting.
Turn up the heat in your apartment! (opens a window)
I told you.
Yeah
Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.
Why are you doing this?
I mean, every time I see him, it's Tony this, Tony that. George is like a school girl around him
You killed Fredo!
(to George) You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! It's crazy Joe Devola.
(interrupts) What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today. (on the phone) Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we would do that. Okay. Great! Thanks a million! Okay, bye.
When you hear like a soft russeling.
You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.
Oh, I'm sure you do.
Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?
(pointedly) Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars.
What happened?
So it's a nice place to work?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
Yes, they do!
What happened to you?
Maybe a Cadillac.
Alright, its time to go.
I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.
Technically, you're sauted. So, what are you doing for that?
So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.
Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.
Were just not suited to be friends.
Look, its a very awkward situation. I dont wanna be presumptuous.
"Finders fee"? It was on the lot!
Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.
Statute of limitations. It's not a statue.
But that's not what she thinks.
Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation.
Sorry about that.
Eh, it went okay.
What do you think the worst part of being blind is?
Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
Well, its a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.
Kind of in the middle of something here, George.
Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
thanks
Na, that's not such a good idea.
What?
Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.
(Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.
I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?
50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.
But I changed my mind..
Alright.
Oh! my god. What the hell is this? ..... Don't tell me.......Velvet!!!
Oh.
Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine.
They just took Susan to the Hospital
DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE?
Yeah.
Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.
Good personality. Funny. Bright.
Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.
I *just* learned that. (proudly holding the Yo-Yo)
All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've flown first class, Elaine-- I can't go back to coach. I can't... I won't...
Hey!
No, no, the--
You don't think she's just talking to me?
Ya sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? (Meryl laughs. The owner of the coffee shop comes over.)
(smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good.
I mean that's fine if that's who you are...
They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor.
Thanks.
It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.
Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?
Wow.That's hot.
She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was "Beaches" for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?
Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?
I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.
I'm gonna call her.
Well I'll get them.
Yeah, see ya.
Well, thanks anyway.
Witchy Woman?
Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your..
Well, I didnt...
A pawn shop?
What?
(cont) and this whole justice league, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman. You mean to tell me Superman can't cover everything?
Oh yeah? I dont believe youve seen... this.
Who couldn't.
"I think so."
See...women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel...
She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?
Yeah.
Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing?
No ,it's George ( Elaine laughs heartily)
(Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-
My foot fell asleep.
(To cashier) I'd like to speak with the manager, please.
Well, so what's the difference?
No, Uncomfortable? Not at all. (ASIDE TO ELAINE) My friend's wife's breast sticking out - why would that make me uncomfortable?
Did you give blood?
Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises?
I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.
I told you not to come.
(confused) The black and white.
ALL RIGHT, all right! I'll call her.
This has 'international incident' written all over it.
Hang on.
George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'
I dunno , I'm gonna ask Shelley ,but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident.
What about Susan?
How would you know? You don't speak Korean.
(yelling) Yes I told him the Packyderm story!
Just forget it. Let it go.
She went out to get her head shaved.
It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.
You remember Elaine.
We need you there!
Yes!
"Adults only?"
It's hard enough living next door.
...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either.
Oh my!
Well, just get it down.
No, never.
Wow. What are we celebrating?
Hey, you look awful.
So what happened after the movie?
You're not gettin' any skin, Kramer.
Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right?
I don't know!
No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch)
I couldnt tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that
Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.
It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.
(stunned) Is that right?
No. No, I can't!
(walking out) Thanks for having me over, guys.
Yeah, and?
(Kramer shows Jerry and Elaine the paper) "Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research".." Government funds genetic research at area hospital" ... Yeah, so?
SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya! (the inter- com buzzes) Yeah?
Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.
You what?
Yeah.
You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me. He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back.. I'm putting this guy ....RIGHT OUT OF COMMISSION....
(eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.
You got no waist in that thing.
How's it going?
Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!
Yeah.
If he's black.
All right, lets go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.
So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.
Shh! Nothing, nothing.
"Why. You took a shower?"
Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there.
No. This is why you're not in the pilot.
He said they had a good time.
You bought it for six!
Why don't you get a sandwich?
(leaving) Konichi-wa.
You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.
(pointing to Elaine) Her father wrote that.
You do the tub?
Why can't you get it?
What are you, a medieval dungeon master?
Uh oh.
Colin?
You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?
What am I gonna say?
Well, I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.
Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice.
You tried Aaron, it was too expensive.
Well, what d'you think?
Hey! What is wrong with you?!
Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...
Four hundred a month.
Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.
Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. Weve been doing this silly, dumb voice.
First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did.
Where's Simon?
Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?
Oh, come on!
Hey Georgie!
No, we don't care, we just want to go.
O.k., good, I'll see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.)
How ya doin'?
Hey.
Jerry, You want to pick her up?
That seems about right.
Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be? (Elaine laughs - hu) Why can't you live?
Give me another shot!
Im just a regular person.
Come on up.
Madeline stays here.
He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.
You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.
Oh, great! Alright. (We hear the announcers calling the game.)
Oh, please...
Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though.
You get out of here!
Ah, actually, I ka, kinda had some things to do.
(locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.
Good body, nice body.
Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.
Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.
Aww.
Look at your skin.
(Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.
Hey, have fun at the... family reunion. (George exits) So, what do you know about this Jack fellow?
Bless you.
Well how did he react when you gave it to him?
It was not!
I'm goin' home.
What?
Okay, just hand that over, please.
Fine.
No.
You didn't like that crack about the pen.
Spending the night. Optional.
Hello? Is this 555-8383?
Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?
Hey
(excited) Oh, my little airplane lamp.
Wha - wha - what's the matter?
A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?
Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)
you know, I think George has a non-sexual crush on him
Listen, Matthew, I-I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do.
I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife fight for a citrus drink.
I didn't think so.
Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania)
He went to get some steak sauce. Why?
David!
I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone.
Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
It's not even my car, it's a rental.
(to himself) This is a new one.
You mentioned the raisins.
And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.
Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
Dinner?
We're talking.
Yeah.
Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.
Will you shut up George.
I know.
Killed?
(George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party?
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.
I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over this whole operation!
I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.
(singing) Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home.
Kramer, you know, I--
Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 650 AM tomorrow morning.
How long did you leave it up there?
Hi,
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?
It's not complicated.
I know.
(smugly, under-his-breath) Not only that, I broke his thumbs.
(Interrupting Bania) Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.
Really?
Hey what are you doing Friday night?
Easy?
Oh, that'll intrigue him.
No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.
All right.
No good?
"No... I find them repugnant and unappealing."
Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?
(Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.
Alright, that's it.. (Grabs Kramer, trying to pull him out of the car)
No, I'm calling her.
So you want me to get the books? Is that it?
Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything.
I thought we were talking about me.
Hey, were kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?
(in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.
Oh, that adopt-a-highway thing.
Yeah, I-I know...
Kramer. Yeah that'll do.
She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
Where you goin'?
Ooh! Very convenient.
Okay.
Really?
(doubtful) I don't know, do you have a--
Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.
It's a little short.
What happened you didn't give her the papers?
So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?
Is that your "chicken" making all that noise?
Why can't you do this on your table?
You're sure?
I got no problem with that.
You satisfied? So you see?
Yes, its my lifes work.
No, believe me it's not good. I'll mail you a new one with something really funny written on it.
It's nice to get a reach.
By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.
But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.
That's my cockney accent.
What?!
What?
(matter-of-factly) Youre engaged.
Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?
What time is the lesbian wedding?
Yeah,, me too.
(taking the jacket) Thank you.
Could you?
Hey Elaine, it's me.
What?
Well, let's start the insanity.
I thought youd be upset.
Hi Doris.
Okay.
So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.
Heeeey!
(opening the door) Well, it was nice meeting you.
It's All-Tempa-Cheer.
Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.
Im getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other line beeps) Im getting another call, see ya(answers call) Hello!
A stupid what?
You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.
Yeah.
Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.
Oh, boy.
They really stick to that understudy rule.
I said I couldnt believe you liked that commercial. So what?
Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.
So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything?
Really? Her mother.
Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.
All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.
Compact, lipstick, all this?
No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.
(laughing) Oh you must have done something.
What?
I live in New York. (slams the cab door) What the hell happened?
You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.
Woodhaven.
So how'd you hit the car?
So youre pretty much
Thin ice, George. Thin ice..
What happened?
I thought there were two outs.
You promise you'll never come in here again?
Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.
Ok. Uh
All right, go, it's a race! Come on!
You know, instead, Im like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.
He's fantastic.
You know, I think I'll just take the check.
What do we got?
(Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine?
Really, Im not answering anymore.
(incredulous) I gave you a hundred dollars?!
Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I?m the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me!
See you later. (to Elaine) Well we cant all be dating podiatrists. (Elaine laughs)
Yeah, thats good. Hed clunk our heads together like Moe.
Well , as I said this type of thing is very common in show business
Good! Don't! Are these my keys?
I told you when I met her.
Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference who's tall. We're all tall.
(explanation) He's new around here.
I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.
What?
All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! Just wait here and I'll get it for you. ... Kramer this is Tia.
Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.
I don't think that's Salman.
Lainy!
Shes subletting Carols place for a month.
What is it?
Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me?
hey Kramer do me a favour .
Yes it is. I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior.
Oh, hey Ramon.
I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?
(Resisting) Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I-I can't wear this!
She hasn't told her father yet?
And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.
I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?
Yeah!
I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!
Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?
Hey, where have you been?
Okay, take it.
What?
Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I would've asked her.
Who said theres a problem?
Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.
Is that guy still there? (They are side-on to Phil who is in the background, still pressed against the glass, aghast)
[whispering] No, no news. You better get out of here.
(Not believeing it) Prior convictions? Leo?
There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.
Lippman?
(To his parents) So? What do you think?
So we go back to my apartment..
He is merry, I'll give him that. (notices a cactus on the table) What's this plant for?
Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?
This is gonna to be ugly. (quietly)
(pause) You know, you're not Chinese...
Why'd you do that?
I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?
Yeah...
You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry?
Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?
(turning on the commercial) Right, quiet dignity. As opposed to, say, this?
(belated) Good night.
Conjugal visit?
Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?
I couldn't do it without you.
You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?
She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator...
Come in.
Oh please.
You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.
I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? (Kramer holds a broken Tony)
Beautiful.
Dermatology?
(To George) Who picked these out?
Well, just give it back, and I wont say anything.
No, no that's for a drug overdose.
So the roommate laughed at everything I said.
Well, what's going on? What is this thing?
Oh, cmon! Its down again?!
What's going on?
Well it's not like spotting a toupee.
(reaching into his pocket) Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for it.
I'll tell you what happened. We got married.
You mean what you were wearing?
Well I thought we'd both be getting married.
I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?
So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!
Yeah?
Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Uh, gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. Alright let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... (looks at Joe; Joe gives him a weird look)ooo, just right... and three plantains uh ought to do it.
This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.
Then YOU would be hunched over.
Any Hennigans around here?
To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go "Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch." According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.
That's right, the Bubble Boy.
And you waved it away.
. Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it
No...
(whispers) Haymen, Are you sure?
The omelet. Damn.
Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, Ill see ya.
I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.
Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes.
Ok, Yeah all right.
Who?
No kidding.
Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.
You did not tell me not to sell.
Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere.
Newsletter?
Come on, take them. You could take Bonnie.
Elaine...
What is this? What are we doing? What in god's name are we doing?
Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.
Ill give you 50 cents.
Nothing.
STAIRS??? There's no elevator?
How about we leave and, come back in a week?
"Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old married couple--" *I told you that pear was washed*!
Oh! well whatever you have to do.
What about a plastic bag?
Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?
Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.
I know, George told me.
We could visit together!
I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer?
How do I look?
Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.
Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine?
You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
They're mysterious little fellows aren't they?
You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola!
Ya he's right here.
Oh, all the way.
Yes, I know youre not gonna do it. Thats why I bet.
If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened.
No, I don't.
What'd ya do?
And did they suspect anything?
Alright. Seems like...a strange choice.
...Guys?
I woulda taken you to the airport.
You ripped off a Ziggy?
(finishing) The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.
I don't know.
George.
Vaya con dios.
Can you believe her?
She's a virgin, she just told me.
You have them sleeping in drawers?!
So, who's gonna pull this thing?
It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!
I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?
I don't know.
(Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.
I thought you'd like that.
Hmm. I thought she became a lesbian.
Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?
I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.
Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.
What is that?
I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.
I invented that.
I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is.
Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey!
Elaine, he's a.. he's a male bimbo, he's a mimbo
Uh Laura, George was wondering if...
The door? You left the door open?
Boy, some cast, huh? Pavarotti, Aver Martone.
Hmm. So Cynthia's your mentor.
Um, actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet. (takes the paper back)
(to George) Again with the sweat pants?
Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.
Are these seats unbelievable or what?
Yeah.
Hi.
You got Danny Tartabull?!
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president James Polk!" (ELAINE had echoed "Uh-huh. Yup." during it)
Ill call him. (Jerry picks up the cordless phone. He points to the rotary phone on the coffee table. Kramer, George, and Elaine struggle for it.) Hello, Ray?... Hi, Ray, this is Ravas friend, Elaines friend, Jerry... The King of Comedy, right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? (He covers the reciever and yells at Kramer and George.) Would you shut up?! (to the phone) Yeah, you dont want to talk about it over the phone?.. You dont want Rava to hear?... Yeah, I understand... You know that coffee shop near my house, Monks?... All right, tomorrow... One o clock... Great, okay, bye.
(Answering to the intercom) Yeah?
Oh, my God.
Oh that's an old wives tale.
I said, never mind.
My what?
What is he doing in the Chunnel?
Maybe I didnt want to talk to him.
(Agreeing) Yeah, we should.
I dont know. Its got a pink lining.
"AMCA?"
Hey.
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.
That's a great place!
I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)
Sponge-worthy?
Yeah?
Ya. (hits the button, opens the door. To Elaine) Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys.
Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. Shes usually pretty punctual. Dont you find that, George?
(impatiently cutting in) Hey Elaine What about the crest.? What d'you think of the crest here.
Who figures and immigrants gonna have a pony?
Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!
George, I want you to promise me something. If Im ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.
He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
Well turn the light on...
Right, right. Okay. (Writing) Elaine enters.
All right, so youre chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead.
What is that smell?
It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?
Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?
You told Nana to drop dead?!
You mean that?
What's it like out?
Saving movies.
Aaah...
Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.
He was starin' at some woman!
Kramer, bumper-cars?
Which is with who?
I, I'm sorry.
So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.
Hello?
He'll like you more...
Well uh, whatever you can do. Thanks.
Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a men's room. That's the end of that.
You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
Boy, It's the way they just slip it in there too.
Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.
(looking after the guys) That nut is always up to something.
Hey, what size suit are you?
Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.
Alright, Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.)
(hands up) I don't want it that way.
Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.
I thought you were on strike?
Oh, no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down. (George & Jerry each slide to the end of their booth seats)
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
I'm not wearing the fur.
... I just got a postcard from Elaine?
Yeah, what else?
(indicates the bowl of cereal) No milk?
Oh, my God. Did he get fired?
Do I what?
Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.
Well, that's it! Tonight's the night. I'm getting one. No "if and's or but's".
Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.
Have a nice night.
Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.
So, coffee shop?
(to speaker) Coming down.
(to Stella) Her back hurts.
Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.
Is that it?
I thought youre like Hitler in the bunker?
I've got a black eye.
No, it's...
We are dead.
Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.
(not really) Yeah.
Oh, The Muted Heart. Glen Close. Sally Field. Well, that should be good.
Beth and Arnie broke up.
No.
(hanging up the phone) Oh! There's my Chinese food, I gotta run. All you.
You better finish your little caf latte there. They won't let you in with it.
Isn't it Myanmar now?
OK, fine. 'What do I have to do to put you in this van today?'
I'm sorry. I'm soured.
(As George sits down) George, we need to talk.
You're the best.
No.
Ooo, that was a bad toast.
I thought you saw that already...
(on the phone) Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.
So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
Sure.
What are you talkin about? Its fine, I love having you here.
Why do I seek your counsel?
What other time?
You got the tickets?
By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?
No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.
Now what did you ask me again.
(bewildered) Why would she try and kill you?
You're nobody.
There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?
Oh.
I still don't know what the idea is.
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..
Dont do the apples. Its enough already with the apples.
So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, hes thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, theres nothing left?
Should I get it? I hate these moments. Im hearing the dual voices now, you know, What about the money? Whats money?
Where?
Who goes *anywhere* with Newman?!
Kramer!
What's your airport route?
Oh sure.
Well what am I going to tell Alex?
Kramer!
You spent the night at James's? Did we?
Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
What'd she do?
That's the garbage disposal!
No, no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts.
Oh, come on!
Yes, change. By all means, change.
Uh, I don't think so.
No, Im gonna take my car.
I'm saying "get the hell outta there"! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call, Jean-Paul! A wake-up call!
Did you at least get him a card?
C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!
You're not writing any letters!
A mental institution?
Really.
Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?
Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you.
Oh?
Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?
Well, I have some money. What do you need? (pulls out some bills)
But, your father's not bald.
(shocked) Broke even.
So, did you two, uh,  have uh,
Its uh okay.
Then what do you call it? People dont just bump into each other and have sex. This isnt cinemax.
He doesn't even care if a man answers.
Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.
Yeah, yeah. Sometimes shes on time, and... sometimes shes late.
Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye.
Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.
Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.
Oh, see the baby again with the baby..
Okay, you tell me. What is it worth?
Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.
What if it's your hair?
Oh, why?
You know, the water pressures terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower.
I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .
"Jimmy's gonna put the moves on Elaine.."
You're right. My fault.
UNDATEABLE!
I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
selling sexual pleasure over the phone?
Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.
Why?
Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. (standing) I'm going to the bathroom.
Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to fancy restaurants. (takes a sip of water)
I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.
By yourself?
You know, we never had one fight before this deal.
(confused) What?!
Im just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.
Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?
You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it.
Yes, yes, I do.
You'll sense it.
Bye bye
Hey look , Champagne..
Try and stay calm.
(indicating) This is Elaine Benes.
It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.
Look, I'm sorry-
She did kind of touch my face.
uh, well I can't help you there (weakly).
I accept.
No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.
I don't feel like eating.
Yeah. So do I.
Oh, you were pretty loaded.
What's that perfume you're wearing?
Dad, I'm sorry.
Yes?
Maybe I'll let you pick me up.
it can't be
That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.
Ive got the softball game on Wednesday. Its the championship.
So all my sneakers are gone?
You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?
Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.
Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump across.
What happened?
Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.
He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.
Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
(Disgusted. To the woman) Oh, come on. You know he's a postman, don't ya?
That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!
Certainly not.
She's not Lincoln.
Alright.
Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton.
(cont'd) Im gonna do it in Farsi.
You. I'm talking about people.
What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I dont even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. Thats what I want. I want an admission of guilt.
Fire engines?
I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I cant imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but thats me. Alright
I didn't actually want to rent it.
So what are you gonna do?
Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually do it)
So that's here?
What?
Why?
This... **thing**... has got to be stopped!
I can't wear these!
Beautiful.
Do I have to ask?
No....
I'm not gay.
No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.
It's a tad dainty.
What the hell are you talking about?
Well, what'd you say?
Now we have to buy a new couch?!
No, that's the rule. It's optional.
(pushing her) How did you get that?
Ya what was this? (HE IMITATES MOHEL'S FLINCHING)
What's all this about?
I bought it for you. It's yours.
Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?
Gee, I dunno what to tell you.
Aaaahhh...!!!
What are <you> doing here?
So have I.
Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard.
No way! It's completely under my control.
Do you wanna fight?
Oh God!
He looks like a Peanuts character.
(into phone) Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. (to George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!
How much money is this gonna cost me?
Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.
What is it?
So put 'em in a safe place.
Oh, no.
Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the sirens song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?
Good luck.
Try to.
Why not?
What do you mean you got caught?
You're going to start your own charity?
It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.
Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it.
Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.
What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?
Well, I-I-I told my wife not to bring it.
Who is this?
I'm sorry, really.
Hey.
All right. Enjoy"Blame it on the Rain"
Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!
Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody.
Reversed positions?
Who you gonna to call?
(to the intercom) Elaine?
(to Elaine) Where's Kramer? Shouldn't he be here by now.
For either one of us..
Fred?
What does he look like?
Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'
I think Ed Begley Jr. has one.
Yeah, how about a mute?
Musicians. Get a real job.
Well, what kind of solid?
I don't care, why are you telling me this?
(turning to each other) I dont know. Hes an importer.
All right.
Yeah.
You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.
If you feed him, he'll never leave.
I've been waiting a while for this. You know it's a shame Tony got all banged up, we're not gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. If you're there it'll be a better group.
I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.
Think so?
"Can't believe your going out with him..."
Really?
What?
Oh (laughing) Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting.
No, you walk out.
You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.
It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.
What happened?
Yeah have a couple of pieces, weak, weak gum yeah
(Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.
A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?
O.K.
Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.
Where's his teeth! Where's his teeth!
Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I, guess she passed out!
Yeah.
Fancy meeting you here!
No.
Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! Nice job on the circumcision but it's not supposed to be a finger.
A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business.
And that waist cincher, that was the topper!
All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...
How's the...sexual chemistry?
Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know, we can't go anywhere near there.
oh you're crazy
Hey.
Really?
Unlce Leo, what are you doing here?
(calls) Hey, I'll take one.
Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler.
Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.
Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday.
Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.
Well, we fight a lot for some reason.
Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.
Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just "recede into the night," if you know what I mean.
Hey you know George isn't to happy, ahh, about your new friendship.
Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!
That's not bad.
What?
Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at no more than three miles an hour.
Thanks.
Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income.
I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!
Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --
Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?
Suing? What for?
What do you mean not going? why not?
(uncertain) Yeah. I'm holding the baby.
Call Rachel.
So, is tonight "the night"?
Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our prices, we'll give you the store.
Well, he was wrong.
Thank you.
Hey, wh-what--
Tony, where are you?
No. Never.
Sheriff?........What's with the hat?
Yeah, yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. Would you mind. I'd like to take the picture back.
Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?
Why do I have to go on the tour?
And you are it!
Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.
I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?
(Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script?
(playing Scrabble with his naked girlfriend) Zephyr? That is not a word.
Where's Kramer?
Hey, Isn't that my mother's fur coat?
Of course its a sliding scale.
I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.
Restaurants too?
Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!
Why dont you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps.) Whats wrong?
Right in the head! (leans in and points at Testikov)
Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.
Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.
Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?
All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.
Yes we will.
No. I don't.
Kramer's cooking up some corduroy.
(shocked) Wha, what are you talking about?
Hes a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.
Hot dog?
Hi Louise...
It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.
Stolen?
Many times. You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet.
That's how it's gonna be.
Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.
He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, that were manufactured in Korea.
Another time? What other time?
Youre kicking me out of my house?
Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die.
There's no watch ... I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep good time. My parents gave it to me, but I didn't like it. So don't mention it again, okay!
What's the matter? What's going on?
You talked to him?
Dad!
Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that. (stepping over Elaine then George's legs to get to the large blue chair and sits down.)
Boo!
Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.
Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!
So we'll talk about the hooks then?
That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no--
Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?
So why don't they talk like that now?
Oh, that's a drag...
I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.
Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.
Well, I can't sleep with that noise.
So? She used the toothbrush!
Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses.
It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
What am I gonna say?
Where are your pants?
(bored) Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it.
My car's in the shop.
I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?
He's wailing on that banjo.
Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
Your hair, its somewhat de-poofed.
A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in The Blob.
Ok.
Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days!
Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.
Use it in a sentence.
No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.
Oh, yes.
Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!
you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?
I thought so.
Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, Im in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants.
Ok, ok...
Ah...that's a big responsability on your hands.
No.
Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.
Well, I have this neighbor...
(noticing a coffee table book) Oh, you got the Civil War book. I saw some of that show, it was wonderful.
What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with. [To attendant] What is going on?
(smiles) Actually, I am a comedian.
I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there.
Hello? Oh, hi honey. (annoyed, weary) Yes, I told him. I'll get it. (George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry to argue with Meryl on the phone.) Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...
Hi.
Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.
I didnt bring anything.
Uncle Leo!
Tongue?
Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole!
Oh, it's a scene man.
What do you mean she liked you?
I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.
Oh. It's back.
Why? What did I do?
Alright.
"I don't know but I was spitting out and rinsing like there was no tomorrow."
She dumped you?
It's European.
I think you got it.
Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.
What for?
(disbelief) So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?!
Yeah.
Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?
The manager.
I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
It's a nervous tic. I'm on L-Dopa.
Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired.
Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.
But I don't want any "sweet action."
Hmm. So you feel "women and children first," in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.
I don't want the coat.
So...?
"Is this guy a dentist or Caligula?"
Oh why don't you go sleep over at Newman's.
Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test?
Ahh.
No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!
Oh, thanks.
All right, then. I'll see you later.
Seven.
Outside!
Did you see that?
No, what? What kind is it?
Hey, hey! I'm with someone.
Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?
Hi.
I knew this would happen.
Well, I did the best I could.
Who told you about Martin?
Oh.. I know who's cooking today!
Yeah.
Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.
Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly.
(aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!
No!
Why?
I know. He got the hit in game SIX. So, so then what happened?
Hey come on, you're getting it all over the floor!
Who goes to South America?
Yea yea ya I shoulda kept it.
Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.
Is that a sectional?
Go ahead shake his hand. You're Jerry Seinfeld. You've been on the Tonight Show.
Tomorrow afternoon?
That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.
Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.
I don't know. Nothing.?
Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.
Who is it?
So the whole set was destroyed?
Hey.
George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, ok...do we know where the 101 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 170 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 134 is? (George just looks at Jerry) No. Aha, ok. (Jerry hangs up) He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up.
The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)
(Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here..
I want that rye, lady!
Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.
Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?
Yeah.
Well, for one think, don't listen to him.
Expecting Newman? That's funny because I just happened upon him down at the Kenny Roger's Roasters.
I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!
Oh, go ahead.
(pause) You're Donna Chang?
Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.
Oh boy.
Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.
She does not.
Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.
Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.
Oh
Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.
What for?
What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?
Ok. (Kramer goes back to his apartment.)
It's a mammal.
Well, take it easy.
Really?
Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.
Hairdo?
Shaft.
Why do you say that?
Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.
Really? What happened?
No.
Well, it has nothing to do with you.
Oh, well here. Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it again.
No I haven't seen it yet.
Well that's a start.
So you're not gonna come back to New York with us?
Of course he did ..The guy's working ya.
Breakfast?
Youre gonna get back together, anyway. Its thousands of dollars!
Anyway Beth, you know i was thinking on my way over how when i was 9. I wanted these handball sneakers, they were all black but they came in adult sizes so you know i never got the sneakers. (Beth looks him confused)
(Complaining) No! That's the wrong doll!
Nah, we've seen it.
Whos he?
She was looking for someone to go to the show with.
So, I finally met the mentor.
I don't need a personal trainer. (Kramer comes in) all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.
Could you excuse me one second? Im sorry.
I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table.
(Adding, fake praise) Good one.
Look at this, my ankle's all bitten up.
Yes. That's what was so vexing.
Pretty much.
Oh, great. That's great. What a night.
(turns to greet Kramer) Hey.
Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer. It shows at least he's making an effort.
But, I never...
What?
Elaine, stop it.
There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair, striped shirt?
That's the way they do it in Vegas.
He took you to Rage-aholics? Why?
O.K.!
The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California!
That is worse.
I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes.
Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?
I didnt know what the coma etiquette was.
So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!
I can manage.
I never remember you with a girl.
Well, what kind of a kiss? Was it a peck? Was it a kiss? Was it a long make out thing?
I suppose.
I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
Oh hi.
Too dumb?
Let me tell you something Babu. You go back in that kitchen -- tell your chef I want the works.
Okay, one victim.
Would do you think?
Did you find out who stabbed him?
I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.
You're not a writer.
TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.
(hitting metal with the first strike of the shovel) Well, that was easy.
[with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?!
I cant believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.
Get going.
(Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?
C'mon up.
Bazooka Joe.
What's the difference?
Not yet.
You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.
Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this uh considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check?
What am I saying?
No.
She likes him I mean she really likes him.
Gimme that thing!
Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.
(on the phone) Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.
Yeah, right.
Of course not, if I did would you have gone?
What?!
Hey, it happens.
All right, now you call it in the air.
Done what?
All right!
Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!
Uh-huh...
You play a *Hell* of a piano.
Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.
Come on, its just down the hall.
So?
Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...
Oh, man, look at this mess! You know what's gonna happen if they see this?
So, Kramer pulled it off?
Why?
Where do you suppose that could've come from?
Quone?
I really wanna...
So what'd we get?
What are you talking about?
Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we play one for all the marbles?
Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.
Is Tatiana coming?
(on the phone) Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye. (hangs up the phone)
Ill try and remember that.
Did you ask Kramer?
It means "Death to tyrants".
Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!
Be careful Kramer.
Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!
Few hundred grand?
Russell's disappeared?
Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
It was a scratch.
Hey.
Are you nuts? You dont even know the guy.
How could that be?
Yes.
Really...
Yeah, I started out real classy...
I forgot to take it off.
No thanks.
Well, where is she?
Uh huh, what's that?
Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?
I- no, I dont want to go.
Why are they settling?
Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without.
Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.
Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.
Pam!
...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.
There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it..
Come on up.
Why not?
(Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah?
I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.
It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go. (to old man that enters) It was GEORGE!
Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah.
I feel terrible. (Kramer smiling) I mean, Ive seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I cant go any further, but... Shes just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I cant breathe. Its like a drug.
Women go bald?
How do you oversleep at the Olympics...?
Come on, your parents have money.
Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy.
(to Rava) So, wheres this boyfriend of yours? I cant wait much longer. Ive got a flight.
I knew it! I'm not crazy.
(confused) Dinner? W..What time is it?
Oh, there you are!
I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?
Ah, non-smoking would be great.
The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.
They serve soup at 6 a.m.?
Babu? (leaving) I'll be right back.
Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.
Boy, they really do sound comfortable.
How you feeling?
Well it's gone. Im sorry. Good-bye Bania.
Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.
Yeah. It's in your closet.
Other drivers?
Good.
Okay... but theres no cake or anything, if thats what youre looking for.
(Thinking he's stopped Leo's thefts) Thank you.
I thought you just said she doesn't know??
(unenthusiastic) Uhh, I don't think so.
ya
I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.
What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't respect salad eaters.
No, see, we didnt have ponies. Im sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..
Mr. Fields?
It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.
Stolen? When?
Its wonderful.
here.
He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.
(offering a plate) Chicken?
George's father.
Good, good.
No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?
Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?
Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy. You don't have to mention the bubble boy? I know about the bubble boy. I'm aware of the bubble boy. Why do you keep reminding me about the bubble boy?
Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!
He's a very special maniac.
From your mother.
She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.
Yes, that's right.
He *had* cancer!
Ahhh...The Day..
What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?
Alright. (Elaine enters.)
Last check-in, they were still on him.
Who takes care of your boy during the day?
Yeah.
I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? Thats what I want to know. I mean, its the championship, Im hitting everything.
Good.
Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.
Mom, I'm not married.
You're meetin' the father for the first time?
What?
Hello. Oh! Hi George.......What! ..really! All right I'll call Elaine , we'll meet you down there.
Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 1130.
(looking at his nostrils) I don't...think so.
Is getting married!
You've gotta smell the car
Really very nice and good.
(leaving the room) I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much.
No it isn't.
So what are you doing now?
Oh, you think she was refunding?
He's kind of tied up here.
Hello?
You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!
What are you doing here?
Why can't I?
Oh, Paul, could you hold that door...
Ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.
Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested)
This is Lois.
The police?
Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
Excuse me.( gets up and opens the door)
Hi shmoopy.
Where you going?
Hey. What happened to you yesterday?
I don't know? Consomm or something.
Why?
Ah, I should have got the egg white omelet.
That's right, you let him have it.
How did I gain eight?
So what? A lot of older men have that.
. . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?
What?
Ill have the salmon.
'...downtown.'
Shut up, you old bag!
Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?
I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.
No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.
I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody up.
Youre a human being.
You know last time you had me throwin' a rye bread up three floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off your car, where does it end?!?
Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! (Kramer exits.)
Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe-- "Jerry Jerry Dingleberry", and-hu "Seinsmelled"...
Yeah.. yeah.
That was brutal. I cant go back out there.
Hey, I got a real thing about "shushing"!
What's this all about?
They nailed you on the 20 G's?
Well, thank you very much.
I guess Im coming. I mean...
You know, this is your coat.
Yeah.
Well what do you suggest?
So?
I love you, Costanza.
What are doing, you crying??
Oh, Kramer, I -
(Disgusted) What is with that?!
So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything.
What's the matter?
I don't think I can be that nice.
Yea, ya, so...anyway what was I talking about.
They know how to make 'em...
Bob. Oh, Bob.
Oh my god! Look what's goin' on here! She is depraved! (Grabs a towel and brings it to Lena.) There you are.
If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. Hes always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess its because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.
You like him?
No, I was following him.
(sarcastically) Oh, yeah.
So the squirrel's gonna make it?
(laconic) We're already in a hospital.
I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didnt want to talk to, I could go, Excuse me, Im not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away. I also have a cordless phone, but I dont like that as much, because you cant slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone  You cant talk to me like that! Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone  You cant talk to me like that!
George, george...
Well, her belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) Im bored. Talk to me.
No.
Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.
"You know! Like a tennis shirt."
(Pointing out) It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for "Avast ye matey" - what the hell does that mean?! "20 degrees off the starboard side - the Spanish Galleon!" - there's no comeback for that!
Outside! I saw him outside!
No no come on really, get another one. Itll take a second.
Yeah who?
So, you're actually considering it?
Ah ... let's call it even.
How was your first day?
May I see you outside for a moment please?
And what did she do?
No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.
Where are you going?
Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.
This is quite a condo.
I gave you a taste. What do you want?
Naw, I gotta wait until its just the right time.
If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened.
I sound funny?
Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.
I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.
Kramer, (Trying to pass him) get outta my way!
(Trying to ward her off) Hey. Hey!
(Confused) What are you talking about?
No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!
Oh, what do you think? I found it at the back of my closet.
No.
You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.
So it could be anyone?
No, no, not at all.
Kramer, are you drinking that milk?
I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life.
Hey.
I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.
Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?
Well, looks are so subjective.
yeah, so?
No, I didnt!
Sure.
You should've had some eggs.
Well-well we got to get the cinnamon.
How am I gonna fill two hours?
Hi Julie.
Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you.
I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something!
I know Finland. Theyre neutral.
(Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.
Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.
No, I don't have--
(Pulls a small bottle out of his pocket) Uh-huh. Hey, look what they had on the plane. Schnapps.
House in the Hamptons?
What do you mean, no?
Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia, watching Jerry on TV. Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.
They do have their own schools!
You don't like the Drake?
Oh, Mattingly just singled .
Why would I freak out? (To himself) Pilot...
There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.
Oh, it's a scene.
Hot out.
Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?
(to George) You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.
Is that something you want to do?
Yeah. (Kramer sits in the seat next to Jerry) Uh, uh, oh, oh, Over there. (points to the next seat over)
You won't.
What friends?
Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.
I told you.
Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.]
I can see that.
Fine. Go.
(turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isn't that your charter group?
Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.
Too late for that.
I'm sorry.
That's good stuff.
Uh, no, he's taking the car.
That is disgusting.
I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great! (he starts to install the table)
Artsy?
So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?
So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.
OH! Hey!!
No! He stole my move!
You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the "Astonishing Tales of Costanza".
For both of us.
Tell me what?
Uh.. one of the three tenors.
You don't wanna tell me?
Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!
These the people you currently live with?
I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?
Im not here, leave a message.
You get in the bubble with him?
That's a shame.
Alright, well. Just, start again, then.
And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?
Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?
Okay dokey
Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?
Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?
So it had nothing to do with you.
Really? (sits on couch)
I know exactly whats gonna happen tonight. Im gonna try and act like Im not impressed, hes gonna see right through it.
You barbecuing tonight?
See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.
I bought him some kishka.
So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?
A letter.
There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?
What are you doing?
What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you.
Hey, where you going?
Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand and put it on his shoulder)
I remember that night.
Yeah.
Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.
You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?
Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that.
Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya doing?
...You bite it, you bought it.
Hello.
So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box.
If he does.
Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.
First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.
New deal?
I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.
Do you believe that guy?
Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?
Oh, I was just looking for er, some... gum or... mint.
(Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.
Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... Im sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if...
You can't play Kramer.
Sure you can. Why not?
Got it.
That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus?
Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?
Come on stop.
Why didn't you pull over?
What?
It is not!
They said they were interested in me.
So how come you're not going over there for dinner?
Ah, mint.
Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may depend on it.
Yeah.
hey you know it's weird because that voice sounded a little familiar to me
(to the intercom) Elaine?
Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.
I can't buy mangos and plantains?
Right. I am.
My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on. (Kramer enters with a bucket and starts filling it with water on the sink) Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.
It is so my business!
Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener - what other conclusion could one reach? (The phone rings.)
(Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.
No, Trini Lopez.
Elaine, let the man make his soup!
Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket.
Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?
How about 'Mickey'?
Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. and we got to talking, he sells Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.
Kramer?
No, its, its just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it. (Jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) Ten-fifteen... No, dont be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, its no trouble at all... Ill see you tomorrow... Great, bye. (He hangs up the phone; to Kessler) I dont believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here!
I want to!
The uh toilet brush is under the sink.
(To Assistant) Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.
Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.
Extra teeth. I love that look.
Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.
Honey, what'd you do with the can opener?
Bye bye
Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.
He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about "Jerry."
(looking at the TV) Look at the picture on this thing...
That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?
Yeah, that's true.
Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town.
That doesn't make it right.
Yeah, too bad.
Oh no, it's Kenny Bania.
(Goes up to it) This?
Newman. He's going with Newman.
Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.
Well, maybe he doesn't have a "get outta here" kind of personality.
I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.
(muffled) Hi Wendy.
Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it.
Really?
Cmon, move up.
What are you two doin' here?
"Wait a second ..Where you wearing those shoes in the cab?"
Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.
(Like a little kid) But, I don't want to be a pirate!
What?
Hi.
I know what you mean.
So what?
(extemporising) Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was registered under Slappy White.
(trying to ease the tension) Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends.
You scared me!
How do you like that? (tries to turn away again; thinking)Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I cant, I cant. Im stuck.
You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. (Miss Rhode Island laughs.)
It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.
Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?
Maybe you can just go back.
What?
Shut up, you old bag!
Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
Yeah.
What, you got a problem with the pen now?
(Reasoning) You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place!
Not a very long trip. (Enter Kramer)
So, do the Ross's know?
So you bought a cooler?
(Hands him some mail) There you go. Merry Chirstmas!
Why do they wear polyester?
(To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!
He's a little off the wall.
Still no Puddy?
What is the difference?
What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What are you Peter Lorre?
(thinking to himself; picks up a tube) "Fungicide". Fungus?
Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure there are many people who do not like me.
(to Kramer) Hold on a second. (to Morty) Hiya dad.
Boy shes sexy isnt she?
I think the phone is ringing.
I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.
You sure? You look a little pale.
Birds?
Oh, I see. So you can go, "Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!"
What?
I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?
What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasnt the one.
(Kramer waddling out the door) Maybe you can soak in the tub.
I thought we were going to the movies?
Well, well, look at you. It?s a little skimpy there isn't it?
Hi. Hi Winona. Nice to see you again.
I don't know.
Oh, I'm gonna puke.
Oh who made you a Mohel? Whadya, get your degree from a matchbook?
I dont know. Theyve been in there since, like, World War II. The rents three hundred a month.
Me? Why me?
Great, I had fun. Wheres the TV, wheres the VCR?
A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little decision.
Here.
Kramer...
It's not one of those 976 calls, is it?
it's battle conditions
What kind of plans?
I'll see you later. (he leaves with unseemly haste)
... Oh, Im joking.
Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?
Kind of a Yankee prom?
Nice meeting you.
Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.
No, I haven't.
Oh. Sorry, I didnt know..
Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!
Yeah, and Poppie's got problems...
I Love you.
Tryptophan.* (*footnote - see end of script)
Why not you?
A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.
What is it?
He asked you to watch them not wear them.
It's been three days already, forget about Lupe.
No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?
Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?
Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.
How about our little Elaine huh? Attended the finest finishing schools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions. Debutante balls. Look at her now. Interviewing Mohels.
We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!
(not excited) Youre engaged?
I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.
But I was promised this slot.
Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...
Hey Joe! HOW YOU DOING?
Yeah, thanks.
. . . Poor bastard.
(walking up) Pendant? Those bastards.
The coffeeshop?
So what are you going to do?
What for?
So what?
Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.
The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!
Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.
See ya. (Jane Leaves; after the door closes Kramer jumps in shock) what's with you?
Just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces Kramer) Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!
Without Elaine? What for?
So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?
More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.
Mohair, I think.
Huh?
Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome.
I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me "C'mon Jerry, go along, go along..."
How ya doing?
He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. "I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"
Okay. (He leaves)
Well you've really built yourself up into something.
How much are they payin' you?
Whatever you want me to tell them.
You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? When I'm on stage that's all I hear; You stink, You suck. We like magic.
Are you sure he cant hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.
Hey! Hey Mick.
Hey Fred.
Y-You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set!
Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.
No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.
Women need to like the job of the guy theyre with. If they dont like the job, they dont like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. Well, right now, Im the regional management supervisor. Im in development, research, consulting... Men on the other hand  if they are physically attracted to a woman  are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men dont really care. Menll just go, Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? Youre just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why dont you shower up, and well get some burgers and catch a movie.
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.
So, go get them.
Mom, Dad.....I have fleas..
Arent you gonna take it?
What do you mean you don't know?
Yeaaaah!!!
No, Mr. Field, look, really I'm--
(Butting in) Tina Turner?
What about if youre not around?
Broke even.
It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.
Hey Joe.
Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?
We were right on the border.
(cutting in) I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman.
'Maybe'!?
Biff?
Right by her?
We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident.
Yes, bye.
Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.
It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.
A uh, one of those guys.
Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?
Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...
I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.
Nothing.
So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.
Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.
Trip to Berlin?
You went all night?
Uh... great.
(suspicious) Really?
Wow, look at you. So you got the job.
The engine's made by McDonnell-Douglas.
Mmm-mmm. Too bad you're engaged.
You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go 'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.'
Yes. We did.
Elaaaiinne...
Maybe you just didn't see him.
Good. And Ill tell you what... You dont have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.
"Where's my Mr. Goodbar?"
No. I think it's Demi. (the "i" sounds like an "e")
Well I started screaming, "There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina." Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running (In the background -- CLERKS VOICE 57) and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.
Over here. You can see right through here.
I have an idea. (Elaine enters; to Elaine) We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three.
(imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape?
Big surprise.
Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.
Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
We make all these plans - this idiot goes a hundred miles an hour - the whole weekend's over - incredible - just like that -
No, there's less.
The" coup d-toe"
"I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat."
Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with you?
So you have no car?
Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.
What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in it's path.
You lost the 20.
So you saw Bania's act?
Not from the footage I've seen.
Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain.
Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are?
Of course she doesnt have five thousand dollars!
Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.
Yes this is the terrorist bomber.
Me either.
Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs.
I think I offended the wake-up guy...! (worried)
I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.
Cookies don't liquefy.
That's a five.
Alright, sit down, sit down. (Grabs a pill from the bottle, and starts advancing tward Kramer - like an owner with his dog)
Aw.
Clean as a whistle.
Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!
You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West? Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.
(to Morty) What about you?
Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.
How's it look?
Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.
Suspected serial killer, he didn't actually do it.
So you go in the bathroom at eleven your in bed by what, two?
Too Gubernatorial. (?)
(lying) Yes.
Yeah, so do you. (George enters with a newspaper.)
We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these women.
He's late already.
Not with a cane?
Uh-huh. Yeah. So, anybody specific?
Oh, that's okay.
Oh, thanks.
Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strange the whole flight?
If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
Sure, fine with me.
Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up...
Elaine...
How can he not know that?
Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!
I don't know.
Tim Whatley?
I notice you threw 'stocky' in there.
We'll be fine, what did she say?
Something on your mind?
That's enough!
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! No!!! Thank you. (Hangs up.) I don't believe this. They've added Bania to the network showcase and he's going on right after me.
Uncle Leo!
Is she?
(snaps fingers) Now that you mention it.
Right.
He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.
It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.
Oh, Im sorry. Im just waiting for someone.
Im Dan. Can I have my list back, please?
One of the problems in life is that when youre a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, I got the front seat I wanted the front seat! I called it. And the other kid knows hes got nothing to say He called it. What can I do? If there was a Kid Court Of Law, it holds up. Your Honour, my client did ask for the front seat And the judge would go, Did he call it? Well no, he didnt call- BANG! (Jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled.
What look?
I was lying, give it to me!
I can ball park it.
Oh, it's George.
You mean he just
What if my life depended on it?
How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it.
Wait a second. (Grabs the icebucket off the counter.) This'll scare 'em off. (Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. Jerry gets back into bed.) Well, good night, Ollie.
All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll meet you in front of the theatre.
Hey.
The dog? The dog??
What for?
No, I actually find you quite charming. A bit verbose at times...
Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?
Come on up . (looks at his watch) ...What's he doing here now?
He was gonna fire you?
You're Filk.
The captain of the toes. (phone rings) Hello.
Fine, if I'm off yours.
Your spare set?
Hello Newman.
Well Lisi, that was another-
Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer.
We found out his super power was lack of money.
Kramer, I want my car.
Talk show host. That's good.
Hey.
Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.
you moved into a hotel?
(Explaining) George has become a hand model.
Hang on.
You're wearing the chocolate shirt!
It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.
No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.
Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?
Oh, really?
Svengali.
What did you say?
Awe... That's nice!
I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.
There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her
Kramer, what the hell did you do?
Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!
That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother.
I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
Ah, that's a shame.
You know I dont get that whole suicide machine. Theres no tall buildings where these people live? They cant wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?
Kramer!
When are ya gettin' out?
Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...
Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.
How's it coming?
I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man.
Why outside here?
So theyre not paying you your
Elaine!
Oh, no, not beautiful.
Did he take 'em?
Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.
She's been in Mexico for six weeks.
(muffled) Would you like something to drink?
Oh, I get it, this is about the button.
Having her in jail.
What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.
Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.
(Joking around) I think it's the stench of death.
He swore me to secrecy.
We haven't spoken.
Uh-huh.
He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?
Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino.
Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
How you gonna get out of *that* one?
Alright Elaine.
Let me call him back... Hello? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.
Oh, that guy was your cousin! (walking in front of George so he gets the picture to leave)
Tippy Toe? I dont think so.
See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.
Yeah...my wife.
Of course, I stink, you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks..
Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.
I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y. (he spits it into the waste bin)
Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.
You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.
Hi.
What's all this stuff?
My honest opinion, I think she made it up.
Oh uh ...
Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?
Hello?
Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.
Well, I'm not.
Really? What would you like to do?
You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. (Phone rings, he answers it) Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend.
I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.
Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
Except that it's not Putty.
Yeah.
Well, she could come.
Nooo.
Where did you see that? Those are private!!!
Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.
Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?
Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.
Well there's spaces there, they must drive!
Then that's the meal.
Yeah...
Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar!
It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look (searches for word) stupid. (to salesman) I'm sorry.
But it was in the cylinder!
You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.
Its mostly water weight.
What, it...it's here in the building?
What's the harm?
Who you calling?
What do you mean replace it?
It's still bleak.
What are you, crazy?!
Ooo, could be from that blonde
Georgio! Nice duds!
Let's get out of here.
Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.
Who wouldn't like him? I like him. And I'm a guy.
C'mon up. (To George) Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'
Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.
Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that.
Oh, I cant. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly.
You're not feeding him, are you?
No, but the difference is negligible.
(sarcastic) Thanks for stopping!
Hm.
Ah.
Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.
Oh... all right... wanna get some pizza?
Yes , I got her number.
Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats right behind the glass?
Not you! The guy in the Amigo.
We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.
So, the free love buffet is over?
Unbuttoned, or all the way off?
So Marcelino's going to take down the check?
(deadpan) No.
I love the Drake!
She's the performance artist, right?
Whom I gonna tell?
That's true.
Yeah.
He asked me to. We were getting along.
But not anymore.
You dont think it mightve had anything to do with that?
Well the-the crowd must have gone wild!
A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions) Ho, ho, ho.
I didn't see anything.
'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?
All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom cab.
You know this...
It was a gift.
So what.
Your boyfriend, he's taking it out.
Oh hi, Katie.
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, that?s not fair, what about George, Susan and Elaine, what do you need me for?
So?
Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency.
Not once.
Can we go out there?
Your good friend is morbidly obese.
What kind of pen is that?
At least you'll be talking.
What is she making?
Yeah, me too...
No more mentor?
Say something funny.
Yeah.
(sits on the back of the couch) Oh my god.
(to himself) My foot's asleep again!
There's a g-spot.
It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)
The Drake is great!
Oh, the sisters (he sits at the table)
Good.
Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)
(yelling) Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.
You guys both have class at the same time?
Seinfeld.
What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.
Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.
Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?
No.
Shouldn't a doctor do it?
At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.
Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.
How could I know she would start to laugh?
What?
Move it! Move it! Get going!
I am not an anti-dentite!
(Losing it, mad) Look, it's not my shirt.
They're nobody.
(unimpressed) I, really can't say.
Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here.
You didnt call no interference!
How much?
(impressed) Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.
Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.
Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so fuck(bleeped)ing good.
Volcano? Really?
Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.
No ,no I don't, I mean, Don't be silly..
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--
But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there, "Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin. Well I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on."
There you go.
Im not looking.
Why?
(reading on) "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-"
He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. He's a time slot hit.
I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.
I just wanted to say how sorry I was...
My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin' "where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?"
Pamela? Do I know her?
I'm not talking about upside down. (Jean-Paul and Kramer come in) I'm talking about waking him up!
Ma.
What is it?
He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in.
What's coming?
Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately.
(leaning round Kramer) Where?
Huh? Huh?
Something wrong with your chest?
All right, all right. All right, thats enough! Lets get back to my deal. That undercoating, thats a rip-off, isnt it, David?
Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...
Alright, I'll change my shoes. (Heads back to his apartment. George follows.)
The blond with the blue sweatpants!
No thanks.
Who said that?
So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day?
Mine!
I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem.
I don't know.
I'm right here. (note he has an athletic bandage on his right hand) You're late.
Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.
And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry)
(Surprised to see her, he gets up) Where's George?
Can you bring my mail then?
My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while.
Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.
I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?
Well, if that's not that, what is that?
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little...
George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods)
Take it.
That's right, I'm taking a dive.
Hey, Tim.
Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!
It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?
I'm not paying for anything until I get that back.
You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.
"Transfer"?
Assman?
[mockingly] "Please hurry". Look at you. Look at what you've become.
(subdued, almost somber) Hello. Welcome back.
Aww...
Don't you ever talk about her like that!
The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.
It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?
He's a ringer!
No, really, I just got off the phone with him.
Oh, right.
So?
That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!
Hello.
You know what? That was the amazing thing.
Really?
Right. I forgot about choir.
[indignantly] What's the matter with you?
Can't you shut the shades?
Hi.
That's him.
Well, the games starting just about now.
Hey listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, why don't you have dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if you want, you know, have a little company, take the pressure off.
What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?
All right.
is beating the bushes-
All I did was shake your hand.
We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! Well be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life.
What happened to the jacket. Did he take it with him?
Alright, I'll take it.
But it's a big complex.
Who do you know? He knows my hair.
Yeah!
So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't?
(Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 'French Impressionist Paintings'?
But I'm so good.
Newman's his mailman.
(to George) He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.
We're gonna change the system.
Inka-dink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink.
Right, Dana Folley.
Enjoyed yourself.
Like toothpaste?
(about the pie) This is no good.
What does that mean?
Yes, yes, you have.
Uh-huh..
We're getting vasectomies.
Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, "Why knock my brains out?"
You didn't ... (makes motion like he's lighting a cigar)
Yeah, big surprise.
It's a lotta gum!
What's happening?
Know *what*?
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.
(Sarcastic) Oh, I'm sure she'll come around.
I dunno, watch it on TV I guess. Why?
Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.
That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.
(astonished) Oh god! What happened to you?!
Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.
Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?
Hi Julie.
Yeah, right.
Oh don't threaten me, Butcher Boy.
Somebody remember where we parked.
Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.
Really.
What?
We made plans.
I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.
I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.
What's his problem?
Really I'll be back.
Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer?
(determined) I wanna join. I need it to become a member.
Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.
Aub, ah, Gipple?
402? (Checks his wristwatch) Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup!
(animated) You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I...
Awright.
What are you all dressed up for?
Who are you?
But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.
You what?
..living together after a while we... we might start to get on each others nerves a little.
I'll get you another one just like it!
I said pull over by the stop sign.
Could we stop?
"The Switch."
I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it.
Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.
What? Why didn't you wake me up?
Uh, THANKS! This is FUN! Yeah, this turned out to be a GREAT weekend.
Yeah.
Why don't you go out? It's nice out.
You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.
Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.
Kramer!!
No, never.
So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.
Is it...? Could it...? Could he have...? IT IS! (Grabs Kramer.) Poppie peed on my sofa!!
Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.
Could you at least get a hat for me?
Is that bothering you?
Under the sofa cushion.
Huh.
oh.. uh.. you know your breath is a little garlicky you better take some gum.
Mulva...
Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time.
Really?
Five o'clock.
That's room 419. 650 AM. Four...one...niner...
I'm open. There's just nothing in there.
Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!
She's your Lex Luthor!
Yeah.
Who?
No, hes making a bouillabaisse.
The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.
(To George, in a 'cha-ching!' motion) Vermont! (To Ellen) With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to! (George is disturbed. He gets up, goes go Kramer's door, and knocks. They talk) Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I can't wait.. buy-bye. (Hangs up. George and Kramer come into Jerry's apartment, confronting him) What? (George takes the phone off the hook) What is this?
Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?
Knicks? Rangers?
Oh, no, no.
I dunno...
I'll say.
Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida.
It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.
What happened to you? You were going like a hundred miles an hour.
Yes.
no I gotta go downtown
Yeah, I heard.
(turns) Newman.
Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em.
Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.
My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!
You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldnt expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.
Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it.
Youre welcome.
Why are you bothering them for?
Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.
As good as it gets.
But your were an executive, this is fast food.
Oh, its just this stupid thing.
Hello?
Yeah, right.
He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket books. Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.
Just imagine how much more you'll accomplish.
Kramer?
(to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? (wondering what the hell's Kramer doing)
Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.
Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?
(calm) I ordered in. It's still effort.
Ya take it easy.
What?
Hi!
This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes) Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?
Tell me what?
Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?
That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.
We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.
Yea especially Ziti, with that big hole.
They're the worst.
I gave your ticket to Horneck.
Thank you.
Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?
You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial.
Superfreak?
Isn't that against the law?
You could not like it.
Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.
You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.
Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me.
See, again, I really don't feel that...
What's that?
You should always carry a pad and pen.
Well, well, well.
I wonder where Elaine is sitting? I really wanted you to meet her she's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend Tony
Newman . Open the door, Newman, I know you're in there.
Babu? Babu...[waves Babu to come to table] Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just, it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?
Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.
On the couch.
(Pointing) But are you still master of your domain?
Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.
You like full lips.
Hey, George.
Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?
Fine, if I'm off yours.
I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.
Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...
Parsippany, New Jersey.
Impossible, right?
(leafing through his mail) Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.
(pointing Kramer) "To wit"
He was good in Man From Uncle.
Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. I'm being audited.
They still do that play?
What's with you?
She's seen you in this thing.
(Sympathetically) She coming of a bad break-up?
What song?
Exactly.
Yeah, big missing goin' on (spreads arms wide)
Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.
(muffled) There you go.
Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.
I don't know. Why?
(To George) Easy big fella.
All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape.
Who?
Ah
I went out with you.
So, where am I dropping you?
Oh no, where's the blood? (opens the fridge) It's in here isn't it?
Well, just
Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.
You liked, Newman?
Really?
Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?
Myra, Stan.
She is?
Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.
So whatd you do?
She says I suppress my emotions.
I don't know, whatever they do.
(sarcastic) Oh, great.
Absolutely. Nikki!
Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.
What?
How is she?
(excited) Oh, Hi Beth
Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.
You know what? I'll be with you in a minute.
Yeah, it's one of my favorites.
Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?
It's supposed to be hot.
I'm gonna ask this guy something.
I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.
Now you're talkin' crazy!
Is he smart?
Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- Zip, I'm gone. (makes a running motion with both arms and his right foot)
The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.
osh.
Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. He's a punk, a patsy, a hack.
So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?
They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
Hey, Georgie!
Tunisia?
All right. Let's just drop it.
So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.
How come I haven't read about this?
(Threatening tone) So, listen, Puddy. When we first started this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you want to play hard ball, I got my friend, George, here, and he can play pretty hard ball. (Leaving the negotiation to George) George, vein it up.
Well, they might hook us up again.
This is Nikki.
Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too.
They stole my car.
Tell her. I wanna hear her reaction.
Who'd you use? Gino?
What's it doin here?
So the door was wide open?
How're things going?
You what?
Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do some TV spots for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store. That was Leapin' Larry himself, I'm gonna meet with him tomorrow.
Wow.
I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all.
You're nuts!
So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.
Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.
Oh a slinky.
She broke up with you?
All right, just get out of here.
You're like eight years old.
Yes, I know. I've flown before.
Kramer.
I forgot about the video.
You don't even know what a write off is.
I can start right away.
Your boys should stay in their neighborhood.
I'm working in Atlantic City.
Yeah.
Act I, Scene A..
(Fast) Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me!
Why not?
Except the store's in Delaware.
You really like this girl.
Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity.
(Stops) Alright, that's not gonna work, it's not gonna work. Let me just think for a second here.
I mean I have many gay friends...
Why'd you sell your pants to Bania?
Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.
Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated.
You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin them whenever I want!
I'm not happy.
(Noting) You know, I've never seen you drive.
Stealing? You loaned her the racquet!
Um. I'll call you back ok?
Listen, Joel. Theres something I have to tell you...
Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...
Okay..
Ya, 1397.
Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?
You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.
Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.
It's like this all the time.
Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just wanted to pick it up.
Ma!
What're you doing here?
So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?
I really don't feel like seeing her.
So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!" So he says to me, "What are ya gonna do about it?"
The wheels are in motion, things are happening!
Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go.
It was the single worst moment of my life.
No, supermarket.
Yeah, it's very good. (reluctantly)
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry. Got any booze? What's say you and I get ripped!
A matron?
So Whatley sayd to me, "Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic."
Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.
And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.
Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off.
Talk to me.
No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No.
Hey, lll just keep swimming. Hey, hey. Im not done. I know what you're up to Ramon. Because Im a member here, this is my place to swim.
What the hell...? Why is the door open?
My show from last night.
(sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.
Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?
I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal?
Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.
I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.
George-
I can get it. (feeling his face)
Alright. (Jerry opens the door for George)
(Out of it) Yeah, good morning.
Oh no. Thats impossible. Id rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.
Uh, friend of a friend. And you?
So, you've done this?
Sorry, I don't have any cash.
Well, well, why are you getting rid of your refrigerator? (he gets up from the table and carries a dish into the kitchen)
Well, you seem happy.
Excuse me?
How did you get fleas?
It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
I wonder.
Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from ourselves. That's what you said.
Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)
yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas..
I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.
(On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.
Oh, stop it.
You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.
It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.
(Looking away) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.
There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a "Smell Gestapo". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush...
George, George!
This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...
Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in.
She looked great.
(walking towards door with Elaine) How long did you last? (opens door)
Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.
Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy.
Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!
Oh, so you need to know?
(Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say "Hi", and I say "Hello".
I think that's for the best.
You have to know, you must know.
Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?
So youre staying at Play Now?
I do.
Right, you were leaving.
You can't. That's why they lose very few players.
That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!
(To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up)
No, no.
No, you stay here in the car. I may need you.
He called you?
Can you conduct your business elsewhere?
Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on.
So?
Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.
So ah, what did you do last night?
Where'd you get the bricks?
(accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?
[in French accent] Pardon.
(downcast) No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
What?
...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, "Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now." "This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration." You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration, (waves imaginary wallet) "Here's fifty-six people that know me." Cop goes. "Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check."
What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?
Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?
Alright, soldier boys, let's fall out.
Hi.
Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to Elaine)
I'm not lying.
Best friend- Ive never been to your apartment.
So what happened with Tatiana?
Oh, no. It is. Just be still.
Eleven dollars for what?
For fun.
I dont believe this.
You found the place.
Well, when is that gonna be?
So get this book on tape.
Yeah. (thinking) That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. (decisive) I'm gonna do it.
Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!
Yeah?
(answering the phone) Hello.
Yeah.
Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me?
(turning to Kramer) That's nice for the freaks.
Yeah.
But you know me!
(throws out his hands) What does he listen to? The all Desperado station?
Oh, hi.
Wouldnt it be great if you could ask a woman what shes thinking?
Where are you going, you just got here?
No you don't.
I'll tell you, that There for you crap was a stroke of genius.
So, you wanna come up for a few minutes?
When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!
Hey, I've been back four days, I want my mail.
Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that?
She's pretty rough!
Maybe.
Don't worry. We won't forget!
I did not cheat.
(interested) Really?
Ma.
All right.
That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow. It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.
We dont understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you cant stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I dont see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, lets make up our mind where we think theyre going.
He never heard of corduroy! True story, true story.
hey Kramer
Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!
Okay. Great. Thanks.
So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?
Kramer, they're fumigating. There's toxic gas in there.
Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.
What is that, anyway?
I was kidding when I said that!
I mean I met her three times. I dont even know her last name.
Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing?
Unbelievable! She's not there.
You know, a TV show.
Well, frankly it is.
All of a sudden it hit me, I realized what the problem is; I can't be with someone like me.. I hate myself!! If anything I need to get the exact opposite of me....It's too much. It's too Much I can't take it ...I can't take it!!!
Why?
You took your pants off?
Did they uncross the lines yet?
A healthy person.
Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.
So what happened? You gave her my tax papers? ... My papers?
Seven and five eighths
Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..
Forget it.
Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" or, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" You emphasize "Jerry" or "bring."
Is this really necessary?
Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.
You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?
Oh, you hung up on my Nana?!
Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.
Hey.
Binaca?
Oh, shes really great. I mean, shes got like a real warmth about her and shes really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better.
Yeah.
What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage death match.
Where ya goin'?
But then we would have missed the whole thing.
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!
Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.
So George and I went up to NBC and we told them the idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract.
She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.
Just lie down.
(annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? Besides it's not a submarine and there's no room for a periscope in a car.
I don't have to be funny, I don't care.
Remember David Puddy?
Hey, Tony.
Where are you goin'? Help me look!
Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!
That madman is trying to kill me.
So then what?
No, go ahead, I second-hand smoke two packs a day.
Ah...
You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?
(coming out from the bathroom) who was it?
Maybe.
Hug is definitely good.
You're going to do something about it?
Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.)
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity?
I could tell.
There must be some mistake.
Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?
So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil
Yeah, it's no big deal.
He feels funny. You don't have to do this.
Thanks again.
I can tell you what to do.
Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes.
Hey-yah, ho-ah, hey-yah, ho-ah.
Leroy
I never heard her say hi.
Hey, look at the high score--"G.L.C." George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?
Mugged?
Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.
I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.
She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...
(incredulous) You're making your own cigars now?
Thats perfect.
I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?
What is this thing around your neck?
I'm afraid we're out of time.
And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table)
Is this about me?
He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?
Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?
I know. Pretty steep.
Well it's not tragic.
(holding up the '# DAD' shirt) We're even.
I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.
Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.
Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.
Hey.
He pulled an LBJ on you.
I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I - I don't even remember the name of the town.
Tuberculosis
So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?
Gimme ten.
So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?
Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. (pause) Did you?
Do you hear this clunking?
What'd you think?
Yeah. Eighteen strangles.
Sleeping in the caragain?
Is that my towel?
I, I'm not happy with what I wrote.
Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! (runs back to his seat) Bad lighting on the porch.
Ah, that's a shame.
Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.
Where you goin'?
Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?
Irish money?
What're we gonna do?
(coyly) Oh, nothing important.
Sorry.
What?
No, no, no. I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.
Who's gonna be O'Brien?
That's nice of you to say.
Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.
You got a mickey source?
I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?
Did you two break up?
No. I'm waiting for...
Youre imagining this. Really.
Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.
Hey Seth. Man it is coming down hard out there.
It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
(screams).
Really?
Look at you, youre still thinking about it. Ill never feel comfortable.
(pointing to Kramer's hair) You got some suds over here.
I don't think so.
Elaine danced?
I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?
No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.
You got something in your teeth there.
No.
Yeah, see you.
Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.
Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?
I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!
Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)
Oh, come on.
Why not?
Well, how much are you going to invest?
Oh my God, the blood!
No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt.
A cashmere sweater.
Well, one of the gypsies took it.
I know it's a big problem.. she puts like four pieces in her mouth, it's ridiculous, I don't think we're gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
Come on Newman. Do it.
She knew that.
I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?
In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.
Tuberculosis
Yeah, that's right!
(sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand.
That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
Mulva? (waves off George with his hand)
115.
What's happening? What, you doing, come and talk to us.
You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store.
Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.
Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.
I don't know, you know, what if...?
You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it.
Yeah.
You got a lot to learn about pancakes.
What are their living expenses?
Manly.
And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard-working Americans!
What is that, a 12 gauge?
The what??
'Pottery Barn'?
To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in, in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in "morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? fine" Ten minutes later you see him in the hall, "How ya doin'?" Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow "Hey" You start coming up with nicknames for them. "Jimbo."
The Kavorka? Whats that?
Do you ever win at poker?
Yeah, I blamed it on you. Hi Tim.
(Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.
(looks at watch) Ten-thirty.
Oh.
So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!
So what plans do you have?
I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back.
So, how was it?
I don't know what to do.
Poppie!
They just wanted the armoire?
Hey.
No, you don't have to buy anything.
Holy cow! Have a nice life.
Stacey.
She didn't touch it.
Oh right, the new job, how is it?
Elaine its her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back.
Elaine, you cannot judge a person on a situation like that. I mean it's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert
Ah, Kramer.
I was saying the same thing.
Which one do you think I want?
I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.
Ooh, nothing.
They're next to the poker chips.
Get off the phone!
Im a guy  it always looks like that.
Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort?
(impassive) Ah, I'm a little turned off.
Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.
Ah, Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
So what did you do there all day?
Ah, just remember when you see him tomorrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him.
As a mater of fact, he did.
Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?
All right, all right. (trying on the suit jacket)
Oh yeah, right...
I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care
I can't go to sleep at nine o clock!
Well he doesn't even want himself there.
Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?
I'm telling you man, I'm losing it.
Seems reasonable.
(Reads the pill bottle) What kind of pills are these, anyways?! "For Smuckers"? "May cause panting and loss of fur"? (Turns to Kramer) These are dog pills!
Booze is not a religion.
Yeah.
(on phone) hello.
No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out.
What? What?
(reading note) Oh my god!
So I take it he's spongeworthy?
Have you come across this?
Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.
You've got really specific tastes.
I got your message, (sitting) so I came straight from Atlantic City.
Yeah, I know.
All right, take it easy.
(Reading from his notebook) I got You enter, you go "Hi", and I go, "Hello." Now.. we need something here..
Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.
Can you grab a nap at work.
(places two slices of bread against Kramer's face) That is close.
Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?
I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?
I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
Hey.
Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?
Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.
Welcome back to the show.
No you go on ahead, I'll take the bus.
You have an airtight case!
Hey ya know I read an unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the other day, did you know the original title for "War and Peace" was "War--What Is It Good For?"!
I was terrible.
Nothing. I'm sure "Jon" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! (Laughs uproariously.)
Forget it.
He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.
(Pointing) You're on.
The Fleckman.
Under arrest? What for?
Okay.
Hey, doesn't Newman have a Bruline racquet?
Really very good looking.
Where is this coming from? She's great!
Oh, hi Evelyn.
Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway.
Hey.
Could be.
No I can't.
You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?
(surprised) Alright.
Hey, Elaine. Did you get my message?
You mean Florence Nightingale. **
I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night only, the big screen. My hands are tied!
Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.
I don't know anything about that.
Oh, he's coming.
No,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.
Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.
All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little.
Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!
Yeah, did a good job.
Cigars!
One message. Hope it's not from you.
Im just saying..Alright.
Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?
I don't.
(pointing) There's George!
That's it! No more questions! I don't care!
Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah?
All right, I'm sorry. What about her?
Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up)
Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.
(looking of into the distance) I guess that's true...
Whew. Did he wave?
Actually, that's--
(under his breath) George.
I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice)
Saturday night (she leaves)
I dont think so.
what?
(Banging the phone against the booth) Elaine!
Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.
Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.
Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in!
Youre you. Were having lunch with Art Corvelay.
Is that right?
Alright.
(Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.
You know, she won an academy award?
Boy, you are really hungry.
What's wrong?
All right.
No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey)
You just said you wanted it!
Opening.
(Cheerfully) Well, a law's a law. (Leaves)
He's got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, Jerry notices one of the movie goers) Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?
So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.
No, I told you I admire your hearing.
Can I just get it opened first?
Oh. Sounds great.
I don't know if they have land guys.
(interrupts)like a shark fisherman with a bucket of (?) Ch....
Go ahead.
He's the Got-no-Green Lantern.
Sniffing, with his nose.
Yeah.
I don't like pesto.
Does that thing work?
That's enough!
What?
(kidding) Uncle Leo?
All right! Take it easy! Take it easy.
Yeah.
I have money. I make money.
When's he leaving? (putting some items into the refrigerator)
No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?
That's were they got it from!
Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.
I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...
Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there.
Oh yeah, you and your *Sergio Mendes*...
Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?!
He was trying to lift the TV.
Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it.
That was something.
Hi oh.
You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there.
(Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell smoke?
Because she's my wife! (The door buzzer sounds; Jerry answers it) Yeh?
Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?
Sophie.
Yeah, I cant eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I cant dance.
All this for a Chuckle.
Elaine, what do you think?
No, it's ok.
I thought you might.
(Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical..
Ouf.
What do you need salsa for?
Are you going to say anything?
Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if its done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels!
Yeah, my grandma's missing.
Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
Oh! I got a message. (presses button on answer machine)
Laura.
Oh, hi.
Oh yes, quite.
I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?
All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.
Why? Is that what he told you?
So what are you going to do with the mattress?
No you can't. (hangs up the phone) Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?
What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp, why do you want shade?
Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here.
No, no, 12-8!
I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.
You were watchin'? Where?
No.
(Sarcasticly joking) It certainly has.
Hi how are ya?
Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.
Yeah. Where's George?
All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.
Yeah, but why would you... (Kramer is eating a peach then disgusted he spits it out) Bad peach?
Coming.
Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?
Oh, you're "Pappy".
Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.
Stinks!
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. (casually leaves)
What, are you on Mercury?
Marla?
It's like 10 minutes by subway.
Where did you get all these?
He looks like you and he's working from the inside?
Make sure you get this area here, where he needs the help....
That's not a good role for you.
You know what's good for that? Relish.
You know you're getting gypped over here.
Yeah, so am I being funny now?
Define rarely.
Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.
Ah, well. Thank you very much!
Watch out!
He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.
No, I do not like the bank. Ive heard the expression Laughing all the way to the bank. I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when theres nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, its empty and you still have to go through the little maze. (walking on the stage like he is going through a maze) Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? Im almost at the front. Id like a reward for this please.
(Starts to correct then realizes) Well...
Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!
I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.
Just like that.
Do you think that's a bad sign?
Do you like the Drake?
Certainly are.
Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.
Ar-moire.
Australia?
We have time.
Whoa!
Um, who do I make it out to?
I just met her, she's incredible.
On what?!
You're looking up movies for people now?
Well wh..wh.what are you doing?
Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!
Hey, Tim. Great party.
Um, I haven't got my watch on. It's being fixed.
An old friend of mine, whom you may have met, George Costanza, has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formally a highly placed official with an outfit known as the IRS. And as we speak, at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information. And she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise.
Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing...
Ah, it's probably like Smith over there.
Seth?
Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her Im sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.
So, can you believe that message? Now I?ve got to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it!
Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?
You think they have fleas there, don't you?
555-3455.
She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.
Really?
I know.
I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.
What, you dont want to do this?
I don't see why not.
Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?
Wait a minute! (A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.)
I had to do it.
It's Dolores.
Last week, on Seinfeld.
I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.
So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.
I didn't notice the voice.
So you're okay with everything?
Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.
Why don't you just have him paged?
They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?
Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you.
I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.
That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.
Kramer's party.
You know, Gary (slams shut the door) I had a little chat with George the other day...
No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
(from the back of the club, leaving) That's it I'm calling in the big guns.
You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding.
(to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?
(calmly getting up with plate of chicken) Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, (drops chicken into sink) was, for two.
I only knew you through Moochie.
Nobody you know...
well it's too much, it's embarrassing
Hey
I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I? (throws coat over his right shoulder)
I've never had a job.
There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing.
Ok!
(in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.
I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.
I thought you didn't want the doormat.
The dog. You're getting the dog.
Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.
There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.
I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldnt do that.
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!
It's your fault!
Ah hah, alright, let's go.
Oh, w-what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore?
Hi Nana.
That is a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. Some guy from NBC saw my set, he wants me to do a showcase. I might have another shot at a pilot.
Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!
Entertainment Tonight's on.
Aah!
She's into it?
What?
Oh, she worked at Doubleday...?
Should I shake his hand?
(Stops pulling on the pants) Alright, alright, That's no good. (Moves Kramer over to the couch) Let me try getting them from the bottom. (Goes for Kramer's Leg) Just gimme one leg.
What? Today? Really?
Ah, Im not wearing a watch.
Who are you describing?
Well, you've come a long way.
How highs it suppose to go?
...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry.
Nice.
That Pam! I am ga-ga over her!
They'll give us water in there.
So join in.
Were taking Elaine to dinner. Shes got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?
I see you there Ramon.
Mmhu.
You can be bleak in spring.
The New Yorker?
She's coming up.
Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please.
Look, I gotta try and help the guy.
Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than "coffee machine show."
That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?
Hey.
I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!
How could she not tell me where she was staying?
Hey.
I'm swamped.
Yeah, that's right.
Oh, she is, she absolutely is.
This could be an emergency!
So You're not going?
No, I don't have any ashtrays.
We'll take a check please.
Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.
Oh my God is that the new perfume?
Ah. Whered you go?
Alright, Kramer!
I know.
Elaine
Hey, David.
I never really wanted the pen.
Talk to Beth?
She asked about you.
No
No, just Meryl.
Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I-I just wanted to ask you a question when we we're going out did you have orgasms?... Okay, thanks... No that's it... Ya, Okay, bye.
I'll try and de-sour.
Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip.
It's good to have you back.
Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!
What for?
Two pair? Three of a kind?
I'm freakin' out! I am freakin' out!
Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?
Rachel!
Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here.
So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots.
He called the right guy.
Love that babka.
Elaine?!
(disgusted) Ohh! You know, and sometimes shell go, (imitates Marlene) Hello, Jerry? And Ill go, Oh, hi Marlene. And then its Jerry...
(catching keys) ...back, please?
George says hi.
Thank you.
Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.
White Plains.
I don't know.
You're going like this?
Yeah.
Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-
All right, but you have to go now.
They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record.
Good meeting?
What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!
Hi.
Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!
No, no. Still doin the big sweep across.
The pick?
You know, I think he wears a piece.
Yeah.
Maybe he knows O'Brien?
It sure is.
And then?
So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night...
Nah. You two go.
Actually, that's the definition of selfish.
Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?
What for?
(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!
Hey.
Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched voice) Gone.
Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye. (hangs up the phone; turns to Kramer) You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.
That's the rule.
Ah, it's just a car.
(Confused) Where's the punchline?
Hey, maybe I should get Elaine something.
Well, at least have some reaction to it.
That is one angry clown!
Yknow, my parents are coming in for this...
Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? (hands Elaine the tape recorder.)
You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.
(to Kramer) You left the door open?!
Uh-huh, yeah. (Smiling, nodding, clearly wanting Bryant to shut up)
She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.
I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say.
If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.
No. Would you just get out?
Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.
But Kramer--
No, you idiot.
All the time.
It's pompous.
Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for? I don't know about that, I'll have to think about it. I'll let you know. Okay, bye.
I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.
You've got to have a story.
Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.
Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
The % thing to do is just not think about it.
Yes, they do!
Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.
Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?
What'd ya tell him that for?
Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.
(referring to George's outfit) And what mood is this.
Just a huge massive coronary.
(to Elaine) I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog. (to George) Get this one "I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest".
(Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.
(Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that line?
(getting it) Ahh. Wit-chay Woman.
George?
The, the meeting you blew off?
Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!
Hey, uncle Leo.
"We"? Since when are you a writer?
You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em.
Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. (Newman considers the implications of this.)
The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.
No big surprises.
Hey, I was dying over there.
Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?
(frowning in realization) Oh, no!
Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.
When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.
So why didn't you say no?
We come from the same place.
That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up. (phone rings) Excuse me one second.
oh look at that I got oil all over me. Can I have your napkin?
You said that already.
(Shocked) You're telling me.
(starts pulling them apart) Alright break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells)
My moms down in Florida. Shes got uh one of those condos. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?
Ehh, I dunno..
I'm a comedian.
(Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there.
Are you kidding?
(cynical) I'm sure it won't.
Huh.
Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.
You don't have a Mercedes.
no what?
No T-bone?
Yeah, I know.
I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.
Hello.
Right. Go right!/South!
Uh huh?
That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I got.
So you were with him that day at the track?
She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.
I'm going
Nonsense. You do everything wrong.
Well they do work on tips.
What's up?
Yes, shocking brutality don't you think?
Who?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm..
I know it is!
(Confused) What does that mean?
Kramer, Kramer, what is this?!
I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.
Yes I do.
Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie.
It's a must lie situation.
Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?
(out of window) George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!
(annoyed) All right. (after a pause) Hey, you know what's weird?
Yeah, but how am I...
Everything all right?
Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?
(cynical) This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday?
Adoring? What about handsome?
Definitely?
Okay, half-hour.
What?!
(under breath) Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..
Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice?
What is this?
C'mon, will ya?
Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?
Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?
Well, nobody sees the... cover.
YEAH? (speaking loudly so the visitor can hear him through the intercom)
Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.
So you say she was on a horse?
Actually, we met in the gym locker room.
What?
"Hest"? That's not a name.
Oh, I'm back, baby.
Well, it's been a great visit.
(trying to divert Vic's attention) What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that?
Let me see those. ( smells them) Oh! I know the chunky that left these Chunkies......NEWMAN!!! I've got him.
I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
Hey, thanks a lot for lettin' me stay here.
Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time.
How are you gonna do that?
It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. "It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad." But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, "I refuse to put any thought into this at all." Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?
Lloyd?
Its a bet.
Why?
I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that? (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying)
No why?
We're going to the Knick game!
(walking away) Yeah, I'll see ya'.
George
Maroon Golf.
" Yeah! What's that."
No Black Jack?
Okay.
Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.
Yes, but lets just stop it right there.
It's over?
Lets hear yours.
No, I can't do details.
He was buying quite a load of chicken, almost for two people ...
You're cold?
Can't see on your right side?
For a date?
What'd ya get?
Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember.
Oh, you know.
How'd it go?
Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
Did you steal my car?
And she was beautiful in that bra! I'm crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging, free wheeling attitude!
(adamant) No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back.
Ah, Le'me see. (hands Jerry the playbill)
(into the phone, with a disguised voice) So, what's going on?
oh you think she's Erika, the phone sex woman
What happened?
Buddy?
So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up The good, the bad, or the ugly.
I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...
(While digging in his pocket for some money, he looks over the shirts one last time) You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt..
You're gonna have gorgeous kids.
What's the matter with you?
Yours or hers?
At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.
What for? Oh come on.
(disappointed) Answering machine. (jovially) Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.
You mean golf?
And there's so much more to go.
I know, I feel bad about that...
(quietly crept out) This is really weird..
Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.
(for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.
Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.
What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police dont use them for, you know, crowd control. (Jerry crouches down, and makes like hes riding a pony.) Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, Im talking to you. Behind the barricades! So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldnt it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... Baltic, thats two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, thats it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.
I'm sorry.
There's really nothing wrong on the inside.
Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day.
Because you didnt have a job?
No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?
Gimme that rye!)
Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.
Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go.
He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.
Hello. Anybody?
(pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you lay it out on the bed.
A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guys got a coma going like this  you dont want to mess with it.
Hi Sarge.
How come?
Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! Its a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!
He doesn't wanna take a ride.
Well put something down, youre taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac and Artie, theyre all coming over here before the wedding?
I don't know, this? (Shows his neck to Sara.)
I'll see you tonight. (he's opening his door apartment as Kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe)
Let me in, it's me. (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the dressing room) Here. You don't know what this is costing me. (hands Kramer the ticket)
(Looking at his watch ) Yeah..
Yes, Ill be stopping.
So what are calling me six times a day?
This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.
You never know.
(Waving good bye) We'll see ya.
No the stools go over there.
Who, criminals?
Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.
So what'd you think?
Oh, Bruline. Newman's got the same one.
What did you say then?
No, why should I? I wear boxers.
Yeah. I really like her.
Right, right, the tractor story.
(waving his arm in dismissal) Eh.
What do you think the Nazis were doin? (Imitates the Nazis salute) That was the heil-five.
They're uncomfortable.
Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?
We? No.
You don't want any of this?
Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it.
Stop shouting! You're ruining the reception.
(wistful) I don't know, I just see you guys together.
No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?
Oh, well, that's at the cleaners.
I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!
I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing.
What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?
Yeah, uh, I'll see you later.
I know, I know.
What's taking him so long out there?
Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read.
I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
Why now?
George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!
So then as I was getting out of the car, ...
Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.)
Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.
Yea?
Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper of the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack . . .
Well, he cant kill me, right?
You don't mean here?
(seeing Elaine enter Monk's) Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body?
So he just shaves his head for no reason?
W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?
Like you care.
What?
Is it a good one?
Mr. Vandelay, of course.
I would know if I had a blender.
I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.
I think we might have one left in the stock room.
She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?
.... (silence)
And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.
In a manner of speaking.
If you'll excuse me.
Irish, Scottish, whats the difference, lassie?
(thoughtful) Hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey, there it is.
But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?
What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?
Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?
Maybe it's in the lost and found.
You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 950, I'm not gonna be able to make it!
Sure.
What was that?
I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting.
What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?
*I* don't like you!
Not.
I know, I know.
But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?
Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.
What is his stand...on abortion?
Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh, Ketchup? Pretty name for a girl.
I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
Oh, you'll find out.
It's over there. I know where it is.
You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.
Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog strangler. (George leans close) would you suck a mint or something. Can I come right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where we are. Where are we?
What are we gonna do?
Where did you get this?
How did you know?
Yeah.
I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.
... this is all .. very confusing.
You asked a date to go to the operation?
(Chuckles) You don't know the half of it.
Definitely.
Its too far.
(Stunned) No, keep it. (Elaine enters the apartment) Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.
Think she wants those clubs.
Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.
What can I do?
Where you going?
You're not going to open with that, are you?
I know.
(To Puddy) Ill be right back.
Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?
It-it rhymes with a female body part.
Hello
So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.
Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?
What stone?
Okay, how about this I'm in my apartment, you come in.
That's what it costs!
Uh, again? (Limping towards the door) I'll be right there.
How was the movie?
(surprise) You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building too?
You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.
All right, all right.
Was there a red-headed guy there?
What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)
"I dunno how you could forget . He kept reffering to himself in the third person. "Jimmy's under the boards. Jimmy's in the open. Jimmy makes the shot."
All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.
Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you.
Susan!
Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. Youve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?
I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.
What mustard stain?
(as George picks up a broken piece of his car) You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out...
I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special treatment.
I didn't even use the ticket!
Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket?
There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.
It's a movie stub from the 930 show. George, I think Willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes.
Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.
What's wrong with yours?
I can tell you what to think.
Around eleven.
I'm not giving you her number.
Bye.
Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.
I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.
He is?
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!
Hey, Elaine.
Just don't make a scene.
Joe DiMaggio? In Dinky Donuts?
Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Alright, I'll see you.
Nice looking fellow.
Kramer there's no way you stick to this.
Tell her you lost your itch.
"Why are you taking this so personally?"
Heyy! Terrific.
Wasn't that kind of important?
Hey, should we say something to him?
different for a man
You went back to the Jockeys?
So, you play tennis?
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.
Listen, uh I just remembered... Im... uh, getting a facial.
So, what's good tonight?
The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.
About what?
No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.
Oh, the Yoo Hoo?
No, we have time.
What are you doing here?
You got yourself a girlfriend.
Yeah, come on, it's a good match.
I thought we were going out.
(Pointing ahead) Look out!
Come on! I know it's something you wanna do! (she pulls harder and he falls right off the table)
(through gritted teeth) Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.
Let's go.
(checking out George's textbook) Risk management?
I cant. Shell get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.
Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, that's it. They go to the next show.
I'm going to be this guy's friend.
You're not a little anything, Newman. So just pack it up and move it out of here.
He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them
Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
Too romantic.
Brave new world, alright.
Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.
Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I?m serious, I?m not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.
Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!
Whad you think Susan?
Okay, so what if it moved?
Why? I'll tell you why.
So, you would date a married guy? That's so hacky.
You're going to see Genderson?
Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.)
Ah, I'm jealous of everybody.
I just thought ahh maybe I could talk to Roy, if um
What's the rope for?
Oh, no thanks. (turns back to Kramer)
What do you make of it?
No I don't want ?em.
All right. Elaine.
"Glamour"?
(tapping the spatula while waiting for waffles to be done) Any second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready.
Hey what about Dr. Resnick My Uncle Leo is going to see him tomorrow .
Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight. In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.
Come on, Elaine!
Kramer. (knock, knock, knock) Kramer.
He's from uh...Trinidad and Tobago, right?
Good, fine.
What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?
How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!
(unenthusiastic) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) Im just, Im really glad youre here.
Well do you feel anything?
I wanna buy back the Cadillac.
Well. Well.
So?
I missed you.
No.
Jack.
He's a bubble boy.
Newman, too?
No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.
He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.
Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars.
No, I want the picture back.
Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order.
Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back
Im sorry.
No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o.
Well, I'll think about it...
Yeah
It's just like in the movies.
Yes I do.
Did she say why?
We just met.
Maybe it's not on this level.
Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. >click click click<...
hello. Oh, hi. What's happening?  what? oh um, sure,  um, yeah, okay, uh. I'll see you then. Yeah, yeah, Bye.
The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.
"The guy?"
Theres a lot of people to mock...
By Elaine Benes?
Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket.
23 000.
How much was under there?
Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me (flustered, he indicates a nose pick)
What are we doing here..
He's the pool guy.
Hey
Bye.
Hey.
Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?
So she kicked him out of the apartment.
Oh, about the... uh (Jerry pretend to wash his hands)
Oh.
How many session did my parents paid for?
George?
Forget that. He's a ball player. MVP< 1979. I'm making wise cracks in some night club. This guy was in game six. They're a perfect match. They like go together. They're like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.
Oh, hi Gennice.
I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!
'Cause that's what's gonna happen.
(pause) I thought you said... "ridicurous." (Donna looks puzzled)
No. The sex was fabulous.
Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch?
Im always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice. Never quite sure, Is this the best lane for me? For my life? Theyre always a little bit ahead of you, Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there? Yeah, come on over here, pal. Were zoomin over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it. The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen? Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday well be going, (Jerry pretends hes driving in reverse.) Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. Im gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.
What press?
You know what? No champagne. Anyway. . . I'll see you later.
You're not gonna have any?
So was I right? She likes me, right?
But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.
What? The physical therapist? Why?
Oh yeah, what? "Buck Naked"?
Course not.
No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I dont know her name.
That's not what I do.
Let's get outta here. [to Buckles] I'll see ya.
Oh, that's bad. Especially that area.
Yeah I guess I do owe you.
You ready?
He got fired the next day.
(A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.
Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger.
Elaine is having a "houseguest." She's picking him up at the airport tonight.
Why'd you have to eat so many?
Ah, no , I don't think so.
Actually, yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!
Aw, you know people.
I never heard anybody curse in a toast.
Is that what the doctor said?
It's not true!
What?
Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!
Yello.
(To Katie) What is the complication?
What could possess anyone to throw a party? I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.
Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?
Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa.
Who is it?
"I dunno. He's so strange.'
Hello.
No!
I don't know.
Hi, I'm Jerry.
No, actually I was just gonna...
(pause, to Donna) You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name...
Well, we need change and all I have is twenties.
No, it's stupid.
Well--
Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!
It was a mistake.
(going through couch cushions) Where the hell did I put this?
Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?
Did he overdose?
We won. Were in the finals on Wednesday.
Hi.
Elaine.
What?
You mean like...Liza!
Hey!
So, ah, what are you doing around here Ramon?
Hi, Dolores. George, you remember Dolores?
Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George "Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again."
The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?
Ah, I didn't have enough money.
Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.
While you were in jail. So you're free.
(Confused) What's your position?
This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.
What is he like?
Yeah, Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would you describe Kramer's hair?
I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.
Yeah, it's all my father's doing.
That's it?
Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to go?
Hold on a second.
Yeah! it's all taken care of.
It's a cigar store Indian. (to Elaine) Read the card.
So he just gets soup. He wants to save the meal. So now I got to do it all over again.
...all right!
You're beautiful.
(to Kramer) Who is it?
How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?
Why are you buttering your face?
C'mon, that's not fair!
No, thats great! Thats terrific!
What are you talking about.
You're damn right you're not buying it!
A long, long weekend.
I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.
Are there golf clubs in the back?
Hey.
'Kay. (Buzzes them in.)
(to Kramer) Who is it?
Where's Celia?
...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.
It's 530 in the morning!
Go ahead, I'll take care of it.
Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend.
I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.
It's like a game of tag.
No deal. Why?
Everything.
Uh, this is George. (reaches for her name) Im sorry...
So?
OK.
I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship?
I don't think my attitude has changed.
I don't know.
What for?
No, it's-
Really?
Hello?
She wants to talk.
Better.
Oh God he saw me.
She died.
Wait a second. *My* move?
Now, all we gotta do is write it.
Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?
I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!
Wha--you have a low sperm count?
Did you call me a wuss?
Oh, o.k. (Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.)
Hey, I want my van keys back.
Good, as a matter of fact. I almost had my own show in Japan.
We've been breaking up for 10 hours?
Did you see the look on that guy's face?
Hey.
(Moving back into the living room) Okay.
I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)
Newman!
Well, I'm not telling you.
Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.
I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?
Right, just like you.
Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.
(Joking about the bra-less wonder) Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.
So *wash* *it*.
No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.
Hi.
So he's an eligible receiver.
Well, maybe he's --
What are you so worried about this for?
Uncle Leo?
So have your parents found out about it?
Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.
Levels?
Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on?
Oh, no reason. You're into karate right?
Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...
Always popular.
Yeah Ive got this old bottle of cough medicine.
So this is it, huh?
So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building?
That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. (goes knocking on Kramer's)
So what are these?
Hi Mary.
You're just answering phones!
Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?
Im not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. Ive decided Ill do the work. Im gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? Cause you send your money out there  working for you  a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me. Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.
You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.
Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.
I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, "This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here."
(Getting up) Alright, big work day.
It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.
What blender? I don't have a blender.
You got toilet paper on your heel there.
Okay.
Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?
You know youre funcifying the whole building.
Who said you have to like it?
No, me either.
He what?
I met her one time...
A real human rights nut, huh?
(reluctant) Mr Mandelbaum, I...
Pull over? The lieutenant is waiting to see us.
think I've changed my mind.
No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage?
Understand you had a little talk with him too.
(as Newman leaves) Newman!
Yeah. (pointing at Elaine as he goes into the bedroom)
Thank you.
Don't get up, please, allow me.
Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.
I dont know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three oclock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someones door and tell them to keep it down? Youre really altering your whole self-image. I mean, what am I, Fred Mertz now? Whats happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. Theres a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh... shh... shhh... shhh... Doesnt work, cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me. Some people you cant shush in a movie theater. Theres always that certain group of people, isnt it? Theyre talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They wont shush. Theyre the unshushables.
(Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.
"That's Jimmy. That's the way he talks."
What's that?
Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.
Aw, these are really strong glasses.
I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.
Now, how could that be good?
I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
It's wrong, it's rude, and it's incorrect.
Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh
(to self) Oh. Twist off..
He could have said "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.
Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.
You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But its really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesnt it? "I really am a doctor you know. You think Im not, just check it out." I dont know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. "Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and Ill give you my opinion." After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what theyre talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants.
I didn't do anything.
Where did you get this thing?
I don't want it!!
He's supposed to see ME on Friday.
(Over his shoulder) Not me.
Hi.
With that?
(applying paste to brush) Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?
Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.
She could have.
Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?
I think Chemical Bank.
That close, huh?
What d'you call it?
Not exactly.
What did you say?
The crook has the machine. The messages arent for him. Hes the crook. Why would he answer- (Jerry gives up on the explanation and turns around to see George standing behind him.) How did you get in here?
Yeah. She would love cashmere.
Alright.
I, dont see it happening.
Hey! Same initials . How do you like that?
Im not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want.
Yeah.
The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.
So why don't you leave it at Newman's?
Oh, they're all the same. Here. [gives him Dust Buster] Now if you'll excuse us, ..
Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?
Oh.
Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!
Well, this is all very sophisticated.
Uh-ha.
Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.
I noticed she's big on the phrase "yada yada."
Typical things.
(impatient) Gone! (starts maniacally laughing) (briefly stops to point and explain) That bumper sticker.
You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...
What? Whats cool?
Alright, thanks again.
Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me...
What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.
Really? They bought the butler character?
Yeah.
Really?
(pulling out a tape from his pocket) Vvvvup. Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your feet up?
You told her?
Hello?
So you lie! What did you tell her?
Hey.
A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning..
Why'd you have to say anything to her?
What did you do the rest of the day?
I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes.
What?
I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.
Who are you?
Yeah.
Like a grandmother, why?
Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's better than eating it.
George NO!!
From my house. I got a whole box of them.
From what?
No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first.
Hey, good luck with that.
(to Elaine) So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?
Yeah, that's true...
Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?
You're gonna fight?
I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.
What, are you ordering food now?
Right, Thursday three o'clock.
(long pause -- did he hear "ridicurous" -- should he say something -- can't decide if he should. Finally...) Did you say, "ridicurous"?
There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that...
(incredulous) Oh, come on!
About 6-3.
All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?
Expect a call.
Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?
Yes, I pick it up.
I thought it was over there.
(pause) If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?
Im not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll em down below my knee?
Hey Richie
I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.
So, how's the fornicating gourmet?
Go look at your face in the mirror.
Go on.
I know the point.
She wouldn't so much as taste it.
I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a "magical world" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.
Hello? Who's this?
(peering) That's an interesting package.
In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.
Bad rap?
Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth.
What's going on here?
Pretty good.
Oh. (smiling) Oh, that's nice of 'em.
Why dont you ask that doctor what it is?
Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.
"So what did Tim say?"
Yeah. (disappointed)
Nah, don't bother.
Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.
Eh.
It was just a couple of blocks.
Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
Ah ha...
Who is it? Who is it?
Yeah?
Hey, it's one thing if I asked you "Could you do me a favor?" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE (Obviously up to something. Jerry doesn't suspect anything - yet) Whey you told me what you went through on the plane, it makes you stop and think. You appreciate having a real friend.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la. (haha)
Huh?
To our future wives....yeah...
Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.
George, I've been sick all week. Elaine was too. Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes. Do the math. Yeah, maybe I will get out. Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first. Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something. Yeah, Selwyn's. Okay bye.
I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.
What?
That's it?
What are you saying?
What's that?
Oh.
But thats what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. Theyre knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus.
(holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.
Ok, let's towel it up.
5000.
No. nothing.
What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.
How you gonna hold it on there?
I don't need a reason to give gifts, it's my nature. I love to make people happy.
What if she's got no interest in you?
Well, whatever. So, how've you been?
(acidly) Shes full. So, Big Daddy. Im just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?
Na, uh, no, uh, I'll hitch hike.
The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.
So what? What would they care?
(Sarcastic) Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.
Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.
Do you wanna flip a coin?
Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?
Dollars?
What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I
Oh yeah? What did you talk about?
...ho-ah. It's, it's, it's kitschy.
Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?
What?
Really.
Seven?
Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.
Could I just buy an umbrella?
Absolutely not. He sped up.
Too bad. It was erotic.
Ready?
I was an idiot for listening to you!
How about this I manage a circus..
But you can't act.
Uhm, hold, hold on a second. (pauses counting) I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.
I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I dont know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because its really not a definite thing yet. (crowd cheers him on to tell them) Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that Ive received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. (audience applauds) Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didnt even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, thats what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, You may have already won. Id like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, You have definitely lost! You turn it over, giant printing, Not even close! You open it up, theres this whole letter of explanation, Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest.
Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.
Don't get smart.
Like what?
You're going out with the stationery store guy?
Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.
No.
I told ya. How good is this?
Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.
Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!
This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!
Really? (They start to make out, Jerry sees the pilot on the plane) Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!
Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.
Where you going?
And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.
Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I'm sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.
Really?
Yeah!
You look like a pirate.
Yeah?
I don't have a paper though.
Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.
Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone.
You dont know what it was.
Alright.
40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?
(looking at the cop) What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think he's getting coffee.!
No.
Well Hello..
Uncle Leo! What are you doing here?
(quickly moves over toward Matthew) What the *beep*(fuck) are you doing? You little piece of *beep*(shit)!
He's writing copy?
Oh, no.
I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the "It's me" on the phone today.
Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together.
Nine sixty.
I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.
It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.
"That's the guy?"
Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again? (listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone. C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me. (hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello.
What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I would've done, if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!!
Well, you know..
You got it ALL wrong. I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoans
No, I just want some change.
Sure, that would be great.
What?
All right.
I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.
I don't have it!
Yeah.
This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.
See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.
What is this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesnt fit him).
NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye.
More everything!
"The Collected Works Of Bette Midler".
All right, I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else.
Yeah, is this Sid Field's residence?
Yeah, you, me and George.
Hello Milos.
I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!
Elainell kill me.
Yeah, what happened?
Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--
Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.
Yeah, but?
No, let's just do it. (Fire alarm goes off) What? What is going on? What is that about?
Why, you don't think it's a good job?
So, could I...
You collect TV Guide?
It's not.
I can't take it.
What did I just pay for?
It's better than Dondi.
Playing today?
Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up(?). Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.
You're still trying to gget that free sub?
Hey ,You think that Shelly's upset that I made such a big deal about the pecan.
Westchester? Isn't that a private club?
Actually I am quite comfortable.
I was just in the bathroom.
So? What are friends for?
Where?
Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin?
My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you dont make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life.
So, you like him.
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer, say it isn't so.
She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. (Slams the door on Newman's face. Then tries to delay talking to Newman by keeping the conversation with George going) So, you want a protein shake, or something?
What happened?
Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.
And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She says, "That's funny." ... That's funny!
All right. Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot. (hangs up)(to George) Casting tomorrow at NBC. 400. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful. (George looks disappointed)
George.
I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
Kramer?!
Shes right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, Im gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.
I don't know.
The third?
Yeah. Nine oclock.
They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
So did I do a terrible thing?
Alright, c'mon up.
We're gonna have to talk about this later. (Elaine holds the door open for Jerry while holding her leg) Thank you. Taxi!
Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him)
I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?
"What the hell his a velvet fog."
Plane's ready.
...You can't put that picture up.
We're only kidding!
Yes.
(pointing at Georges shirt) See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. Its too high! Its in no-mans-land. You look like you live with your mother.
Yeah. Like a farm boy.
Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that?
I don't know about sixty.
I was. But, shes got me, like, hypnotized.
What is with this thing.
He's not that good.
You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!
Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee)
The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.
Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad.
What are you talking about? I bombed!
Yeah, its some place down in the village.
Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?
(Relating) Like the Batman villain?
You got a problem with paba?
Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?
Ahh.
Pretend it's interesting.
I saw one once that could do sign language.
No one knows.
No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.
(stopping them) We better not. (they make out some more; then stop) T-They're gonna be here any second.
Hold it. Broccoli? Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce.
Hey.
No, he just doesn't like me.
No.
Hey, shall we spit on him?
And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus
(bitter) Not at the moment, Brett.
Alright, will you pay for the cleaning?
Alright.
Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass.
Let me rephra-
(to Morty) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street!
Well you know what this means, don't you?
Yes, but--
Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.
(annoyed) Ma, will you go already?
So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing?
Nice to meet ya!
Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?
Yeah. Proctologist.
Really?
Is he gay?
(Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.
All right. Take it back.
Hi how are you?
No.
Walked right over to her table.
How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?
Actually, that is not a bad idea.
They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
(answering machine) Leave a message. I'll call you back. Thanks.
What is that? (Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.)
What is this?
(leaning out the window) Hey Georgie!
You know their timing couldn't be worse.
What about your father's car?
That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.
Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.
I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.
We're going to Atlantic City.
That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?
No, I just wanted to see what time it was.
Nothin' What do you want?
Oh, boy.
Of what?
That stinky old movie-house?
George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!
Nexus of the universe. Hey, Cindy. Cindy.
Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.
I told her about the contest.
Well, what happened? Was she there?
Tell you something...I do.
So it's all over?
I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect.
Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.
Flinched? I did not flinch. George, did I flinch?
Elaine.
Neither do I. (to intercom) Yeah?
Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!
(leaving hurriedly) Wuhh...
(To Nina) Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy, huh?
Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.
And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?
So youre saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, its all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.
Oh, I forgot to call Christie.
It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.
Well, here we are...
No, "yada yada" is good. She's very succinct.
(apologetically) Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.
I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.
Why no T-bone?
Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?
I would think.
Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.
I don't know.
Do I know you?
Are you all right?
She wanted to thank us for the apartment.
On the other hand...
Oh my eh, my Aunt's name is Mulva. She's-she's a masseuse.
We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, hey maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!?
Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!
I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.
Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he?
I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it.
I know!
And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now.
Oh.
Hmm. Not bad.
See ya.
See ya.
And the other.
Oh no.
Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.
Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?
Ah, no thanks.
Yeah, I saw him.
And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.
I want that rye lady.
Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!
Excuse me, uh...dentist? You a dentist? (The guy shakes his head. Jerry moves on to another guy.) Dentist? Are you a dentist?
Its tremendous.
Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--
Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met!
What is this?
Uh, I don't have anymore pictures Elaine.
Come on, let's go Jean-Paul!
You gonna do a little yelling?
Are you sure?
Okay..
(dialing) He got em out of the house.
(Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to look, but Jerry stops her) I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs.
Hey, did I make it?
(Still pulling on Kramer's pants from the ankles) Man these are tight. (Yanking) Squinch your hips in
Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton. **
Well good night.
(Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off George, and puts it back on his bed)
What is that?
It's almost a week.
Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.
Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee.
Oh.
Oh, whatever.
The Jews?
Oh my god, its Joe Divola
Right upstairs.
Oh, it was a lovely affair.
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?
Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)
I said, "How come no one's killed her?" Probably shouldn't have said anything,
No, it's a nine-hundred S. (happy) It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo!
Ah ha...
Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.
Sixty-six years old?
Franco?
Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)
Uh huh... Yeah... Okay, thanks anyway... Bye.
No.
"Naaaaaa...I can't watch a man sing a song."
Is that Joe Davola?
Didn't you call in sick yesterday?
I know it was stupid.
I sense something is afoot.
They did.
No I haven't vomited in thirteen years.
I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?
The Dentist?
Leave a message, Ill call you back.
(mind's voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?
Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.
Well, so what if I said that?
Living or all time?
Oh my god. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops!
So, buy something.
Really.
You think that's funny?
No kidding?
Boys, boys.
Yeah! Because of you.
Ya?
Well, maybe your refrigerator...
Well...
It's softer.
New shirt?
Hey, Kramer...?
I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.
What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like theyre trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?
(to Kramer) I thought you stopped talking??
(Smiling to himself) Beautiful.
George...
That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.
What, you got a cold?
This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy.
Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.
Uh huh...
That's a massage.
Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...
Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll uh try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. (Goes into his room, and comes back out with the jacket on.) Ahh, haven't worn this one in a long time.
Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.
How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?
this is Jane Elaine
A gun?!
He was a nice guy.
How long has your car been sitting in the Yankee parking lot?
All taken care of.
Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.
But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment shes going right for that machine.
Nah, you're crazy anyway.
Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.
You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. And you can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. Then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin' Alright, gimme everything you have, too''.
Okay.
Thanks, great party.
Hey George.
So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is better?
(beginning to cough and struggle) Getting weak... Losing power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing without me. Nothing!
Yeah, whats it like?
What happened?
What are you talking about?
Nothing.
Hi Elaine, this is Angela.
Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.
I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
Come on...
I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...
I cant get involved in this.
Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.
I'm not touching that thing.
(Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal.
(turning to Elaine; thinking) Oh no, not now.
Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (Jerry smiles. George laughs.) So, how's the book coming? (George's laughs taper off...) I say, how's the book comin'?
Really? How come you never pursued her before?
Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump over the net.
Hello?
Kramer. (boom sound)
What?
He's from a.. Yakima, right?
Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thingreal bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though.
(CONT'D) What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.
I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.
Look, what do you want me to do?
Stakes?
I don't know, she just sits there.
Well. (calling down the hall) Call if you're gonna be late!
No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.
Yeah, it was alright.
What's he here for?
"Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable..." Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been "outed"! I wasn't even "in"!
I hear it's ah beautiful there.
I must have iron rich blood.
I don't know Kramer, ahh, my concern is that ....
A cop car.
(uncertain) Don't you hire people to do that?
Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.
Uncle Leo?!
You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. (Picks up the phone.) She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...
The one with the Poppie stain?!
Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.
[To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.
(to Kramer) Oh! Shut up!!!
(noticing Alec Berg walk in, whispers) Hey, Alec!
What is that smell?
Come on up.
Sure.
Ok.
Get Out of my House!!.
You can't even play.
Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.
Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! (Kramer is speechless) I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet.
Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.
Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)
Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.
Like a frightened turtle!
Oh, come on.
Okay....too bad.
Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno.
Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!
The rines are crossed?
No, that's midtown.
Didn't go for it, huh?
Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet?
And if you do?
Why not?
Eh, eh, ah. Winona's gonna be there?
I was kind of um (pauses) making out.
(under his breath) This is unbelievable.
George, you need a medical doctor.
So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head.
Alright. (Approaches host) Excuse me, this is your party, right?
I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" thing.
(defensive) He egged me on.
Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!
What blankets?
Oh, ya' going?
Hello..
Surprise!
Yeah, hes nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper up to Jerry.) I know, I know. Its down again.
Hello.
(looking at the Wizard) Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents.
She's not really the naked type.
Wait 'til I tell him about the book.
Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this.
Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more.
Here we go.
I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.
(looking over the list) Hmm ah. I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?
Don't push me.
What's goin' on?
Aw, that's kind of sweet.
That's because you didn't win.
Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.
....Alright, alright, I saw her!
Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department.
You want to spend the rest of your life with her
Uhn-uh-uhn - Uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer A-Ha ha! Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe. (singing) dee, de-de, de-de-de-de-de (Makes G.I. Joe swim off, legs kicking)
Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour.
She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.
The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be?
Nancy Klopper?
You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.
I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.
Bridget!
Oh, okay.
What are you doing?
You've tasted them?
That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.
Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.
(Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them!
Huh?
Shes really hungry.
No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald cure.
(to Kramer) Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night. (frustrated) Where the hell is that jacket?
No, its no problem at all.
Not that there's anything wrong with that...
Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I?
If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.
So when somebody has B.O., the "O" usually stays with the "B". Once the "B" leaves, the "O" goes with it.
Hello.
Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!
If not now, when?
A half hour, give me a half our.
(Surprised) Huh?
Didn't you explain that to the cop?
So lemme ask you this how long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night.
I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.
I'm a good son.
What're you gonna do down there?
Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do?
Well, thats it. You two are back together.
...But with punching and kicking.
(sarcastically) Yeah, Levine. And Im Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.
(Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?
Dad I'm paying.
What made you resurrect that old idea?
I really don't eat it.
You left the keys in the car?
You don't have a car.
Oh no, not you too?
Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, (has his one hand up and his other hand down) he was down. Now he's up, (switches the positioning of his hands) you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?
(placatory) Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me.
Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.
Marla, Kramer.
Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.
Come on. Then you dont have to see him again til my 15,000-mile check.
Hey! Just like you pretend to be.
I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck.
Who is it?
I do a wash.
So you dont know whats wrong with him?
Oh yeah right.
How do you stop a kid from growing?
Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing?
(shouting) Kramer what am I going to do did you hear that that guy's gonna put a kibosh on me he's crazy he's out of his mind....
Ya broke my blender, didnt ya?
Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.
Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour, then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night.
Oh... *you*...
Come on up.
That's good.
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.
That's not going to be good for anybody.
Whats so amazing? Youve seen him before.
I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.
I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway.
I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
Strike two!
I never should have made up those rules.
Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please leave.
Well, I brought them up there to take his records--
Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.
Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!
Oh, I guess it's broken!
Did he say anything?
I'm not joking!
You know, furniture.
Obviously.
All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?
Sure, dinner would be fine.
(backs his story) Hmm, hmm.
Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.
Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?
He's like a squirrel.
Do the bums ever complain? "Soup again?"
That's your problem, you should be.
The apple pie you had today at Monks
I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.
That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant.
I don't know, but you look like you're happy.
They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!
I dont really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because theres that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, youre sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, Im really sorry about this. I dont know why I left that stuff over there. And thats why I could never be a maid, because Id have an attitude. Id find them, wherever they are in the house, Oh, I suppose you couldnt do this? No, dont get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldnt dust. No, this is too tough, isnt it?
Uh-huh.
Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.
I love Yoo Hoo.
(in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.
(picking at his moustache) You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.
Well, at least he didn't-
You don't think...?
Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!
Kramer, he's just a dentist.
well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.
just press it
You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-
Yes.
Thats all there is to it.
Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that.
Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there?
humm...
So what?
Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.
Well I?m looking forward to meeting him.
Great.
Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.
I don't recall you drinking Caf Latte.
Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed like ten new minutes.
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh!!!!!!
Oh, I'm Jerry.
Yeah, pretty damn good one, too!
Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go?
I dunno...
You said this to her after.
There you are. Did you find him?
Well, I'm glad I brought it up.
What?
I don't either.
World's collide. (points at George)
It's not a purse. It's European!
I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.
She's into it.
It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.
No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!
Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way.
Oh! Hey!
Is this even a road?
Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!
The Charlie Macarthy hearings.
I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out.
Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?
I don't know.
Cindy.
You want to get a bite?
Well, I am sure I had a good reason.
(Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.
Hey. So, ah, Ramon this is my friend Elaine.
yeah, yeah.
You're not alone. I'm practically broke.
Nothing.
(in the hallway, hearing the door lock behind him, turns back) Kramer!
No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.
Come on,
And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard!
Yeah pluggin' along.
(to Elaine) Where have you been?!
It's a simple question...
Okay, so how does it go?
Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?
Hey, Steve. How you doing?
There's girls everywhere. I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator. They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?
What?
No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him.
Yea. (pulls at the t-shirt) This is Golden Boy's son Baby Blue.
I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?
St. Elizabeth's Hospital? Why?
So you have no control over the remote?
(getting looks from his parents) Not you. Older people.
Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.
I like it.
Put it over there.
Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men.
No, no thank you.
Whats with the pink lining and the candy stripes?
Signed over a hundred checks this morning.
Oh, maybe he's got no hot water.
(To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom buzzes) That's Elaine. (Kramer buzzes her in. Jerry talks into the phone) Kramer.. (To Kramer) George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.
My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? (to the intercom)
No break?
Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--
Yeah, but this is different , this is like ,you know, semi digested food stuff. You know the next stop is the stomach and you can take it from there.
What do you do?
What?
I dont think you did anything wrong.
What're you doing? I thought you were changing.
Seriously?
Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - theyre doing sign language now.
Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD.
A friend of a friend of Susan's.
I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give!
Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
Oh, that's nice.
George what the hell are you doing over there? I told you to mind your own business now stay out of my affairs!
(Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying.
yeah yeah what is it with you and Tony? what are you? it's like his sidekick now?
Ahh.
You're throwin' this out??
Go back.
Oh my...
No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?
Oh yeah, I know.
Tell him forty and no fork.
No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.
In other words, a normal relationship.
(Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!
You cant do that.
What causes homophobia? What is it, that makes a heterosexual man, worry? I think it's because, men know, that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, "Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'"
He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.
Yeah, this speed-dial's like a relationship barometer.
What marathon runner?
All right Nik. That's it.
Hello?
No, Nothing.
No, hed go nuts.
Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not, a chicken.
Hi.
You?
And what is that?
I told you, forget it.
There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.
He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.
Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?
Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
Hey, I had nothing to do with it.
I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away)
(Gestures to his forehead) Youre getting that vein again.
We had quite a little chat.
You wanna know? Come on outside.
I really think you're making too much of this.
It's not that bright orange one is it?
Y'know, I think I'll pass on the "Guys And Dolls"...
That's a date.
I don't read in the bathroom.
(taking them) Well, what's this for?
(continuing to pack) That's a nice four seconds.
We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy.
This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.
You didn't go?
Maybe he'll write a song about you.
Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room, searching for the TV.) ELAINE!
Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism.
Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)
He wants me to help him move.
I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?
So get this we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.
Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. (opens the fridge and gets a bottle of water.)
All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff.
Yeah.
Hi. Can I use your bathroom?
You have no idea.
What? I said right.
I never shouldve gotten involved in this. Im a nervous wreck. Im not cut out for investing.
Doesnt matter. Whats the young mans name? I would like to meet him.
Well goody for you.
Why?
Hey...
Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and find my number.
Im a nice guy.
Are you sure?
People are going to steal from you. You cant stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker, whos gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They cant get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.
It's really not necessary.
Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!
You cant have that coat, it's not yours.
Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, "Photographs - Do not bend".
I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or somebody? What's with this guy? (Gino looks at him annoyed) Just asking.
Ah, I think he's probably better off.
No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.
Yeah.
Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.
Beautiful!
All right, fine. Get the soup!
Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner?
...that's why men hunt and women nest.
Yeah, yeah, take care of it. (Jerry throws her some toilet paper) Come on, George, what is it?
No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car.
No.
You're not very bright, are you?
It's funny!
You didn't give that thing back?
He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.
Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.
Nothing...
Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.
(answering phone) Hello?
oh..huh.. is she coming up?
So how long do they do this?
How much did you wound up tipping her?
I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.
That's a good one. Dentists.
Convulsing?
(Crying) What--what is this salty discharge?
It's moronic.
Now, its time to go.
Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you.
well
All right. We're broken up.
To a children's charity!
Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?
I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.
Take care.
But then I found out about the skin cancer.
How soft?
Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.
So, maybe they had Chinese food?
Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it.
That's a 180, George.
But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?
(defensive) I didn't ruin your business.
D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?
Yeah.
I was saying 'baby' way before George!
Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain?
I didn't care.
What's the kid doing here?
No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.
What?
I don't know, "Hi".
Oh no.
Yeah, well you're going.
What happened?
Hey Barry, how you doing?
How many times you been out with him?
Oh, can Lloyd really do that?
I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?
It's subtle.
No story?
That's the understudy. I'm dating her.
Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business.
No I'm not...
It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
You touched 'em?!
Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.
What do you mean?
Open my vault?
(incredulous) You asked her to move in with you?
Oh, it was nothing.
They're Cuban cigar rollers.
(Bravely) Well, what if I deliver it?
(Handing her a small bottle) Here, drink this.
Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha.
Grandma Memma?
Good for you
This is Laura.
Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.
Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.
So, its okay? I could just tell her she can have it?
No, gore-tex. It's new. (Checks his pockets.) Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that.
(to Kramer) Could you stop that smacking?
Five, ten minutes.
Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
Oh God.
(to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?
Two Forty-Five.
(also wearing a moustache) What do you mean, 'what is it?' It's a country right next to Belgium.
Oh like you do.
Don't go a-knockin'.
Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.
No. None.
OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you know you are always welcome in my home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story.
Well, something happens.
(opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.
What's this?
You sure?
Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?
Yeah.
Where?
Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?
You were saying Stan? I-I'm sorry about that.
And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month!
What's the difference?
Come on up.
Two o clock.
(sarcasm) Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.
(whips off bag to reveal Indian) Ta-da!
Oh. Yeah.
No. The police have no leads (sitting on the couch arm) and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.
She's like a beautiful Godzilla.
C'mon, put the top up, it's November!
Yeah.
Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.
It's just...
So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?
I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
Hey. Why didn't cha get the big one?
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me
Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
So, tell me anyway. Who was the BIG mastermind?
I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand.
Middle drawer.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.
Oh. (Intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it) Yeah?
No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.
Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.
You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.
Hi.
(putting on his coat to go downstairs, he finds the key in his coat pocket) I believe this belongs to you.
Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.
Did he call you last night?
(extemporising) That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go.
Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?
What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?
NOW!!!!.... (she leaves in a hurry)
Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.
Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.
Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.
Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)
I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?
I don't care.
Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.
We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.
So, youre back together?
Yeah, I guess you could.
Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. >click click<
(confused) We're talking about people, right?
All right.
Carl, I think.
Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?
What! You're the one who ruined her life.
Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that.
Oh, I didn't do anything.
Possibly.
Hi Valerie.
No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.
Oh! but I do. There's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar. ( as he says this Newman is wildly scratching behind his back. he suddenly stops when Jerry turns around)
No, its not that.
Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents.
They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.
Thanks, it's a breakaway.
Yeah, you in?
So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table
I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.
No, no tricks.
I'm Dylan Murphy.
You can't go?
(louder) Bob!
I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..
I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!
Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.
"Did you notice he always refer to himself in the third person. Jimmy can dunk. Jimmy's new in town. Jimmy we'll see you later."
uh uh because then it would be all grown up.
But, when did I do that?
Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.
Could you move your car back a little?
Come again?
Elaine ... look! A twenty!
Really?
What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers.
But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.
Is he being coy?
I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it.
You'll be out before we get the check.
Oh, really good, really good.
No, shower. So, where are we eating?
Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
(whispers) Damn.
Have you thought any more about that trip?
Oh, that's *fantastic*!
Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set.
Yes, we have.
That's my walkman!
No, separated.
(to the phone) Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you- Oh, Hi. Joel... Oh, you just came in... Listen, I cant make it to the game tonight... I, uh, have to tutor my nephew... Yeah, hes got an exam tomorrow... Geometry... You know, trapezoids, rhombus... Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. Theyre at the Will-Call window... And Im really sorry... Have a good time... Well talk next week... Okay... Yeah, I dont... Fine.. Fine... Bye.
and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!
My grandmother's in the hospital.
Hm, really?
You're cut off, you're out of the loop!
I'm not here, leave a message.
You cannot buy half a can of soda.
Why?
Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guys out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, its true, men hear a drill, its like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, Honey, I think Jims working on something over there. So they run over to the guy. Now they dont actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. Thats what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, What are you using, a Phillips-head? You know, we feel involved. Thats why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, thats just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they dont cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, thatll hold.
I suppose if it was on the protg's way to the mentor, they might.
Well you'd be naked of course.
I had a statue! What should I do?
The fly-boy.
Hey, I love a good caper.
Oh no, nothing.
They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives.
Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls down, make it an eight room luxury suite.
I was got to be 55.
It doesn't matter. I want a divorce.
I dont care about it.
Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-
Famous Original Ray's?
(looking at her) How about that.
You see -- ah, uh ...
All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---
How 'bout those Knicks?
(Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my domain. But I will tell you this I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!
(advancing on Gary) ...and he told me that that... (becomes indistinct)
Look at this.
I thought you were going out with Celia?
Hello?
Oh yeah, Steinbrenner...
(thinking) They've gotta be kidding.
What about the label maker?
Let me explain something to you. You see, youre not normal. Youre a great guy, I love you, but youre a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldnt understand.
Absolutely.
So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?
Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.
(Mumbling out) Thank you, Bryant.
Yeah, he just walked by.
Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!
But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?
So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya?
Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them.
No.
I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.
Let me walk you to a cab.
I know nothing, but what did you actually do?
You told me that already like two months ago.
A marine biologist.
Good to meet you!
Hi
Hi, Elaine.
How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?
Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.
You see , I kept up my end of the pact.
The cleaners? How did it get there?
So? Wheels?
182 bucks.
Okay, Okay, I promise. (puts on the headphones again) Wow!!! Oh Man...Oh God.. Oh Brother....Whoooaaaa!! Whoaaaa (Elaine enters he takes them off rapidly)
Elaine got a new number because she died.
There's no Zorn or Zoutraph.
How can you think of food at the time like this?
Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.)
Really.
I'm not married!
All right. As long as youre okay. Because I cant stop thinking about her.
Oh, no, not Frankie.
(dismissing) Yeah, right.
Goodnight.
The main thing is to keep the line moving.
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.
I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to Jack)
I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--
So, Wilkinsons out of the hospital now?
He's somebody.
Aaaaahhh...!!!
This could only happen to you.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Right there.
Oy ga-vault.
Pretty lucky to find this hotel, Jean-Paul.
No, no Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.
You taking Allison?
I'm coming down.
Aw, come on there now.
Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again?
I'll remember that.
But you said, it can be very serious.
It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
The average person in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.
Then how'd you get up there?
This is what you gonna wear?
I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door...
Ow! Sharp key.
I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.
(thinking) Yeah, thats normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?
So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.
So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.
Well, we're changing the rules.
So he just sidles up?
Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.
Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?
So as he's telling the story he starts crying.
There's none left?
I want the massage!
Not fair.
Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.
His father..
How did it happen?
On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?
Boy, I've never seen you like this.
Hello?
You ready?
Right in front of me!. How do you know we're not together. Two guys, sittin' laughin' drinking Champagne Coolies.
Yeah.
All right.
What? No.
I thought it was open to the public.
Good-bye, Koko.
Youre still thinking about this?
I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.
Nope. I don't think so.
Is he from the future?
What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. (Hangs up)
DeSoto? What did he do?
(While looking at posters of women wearing glasses) I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.
Come back another time.
Ohh. Hey, how you feeling?
Well...
(Shouting) Come on up! (Opens his door for Elaine)
He stole back the rye?
I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!
If you need more time, you should have more time.
Is that Burt Reynolds?
(with a wild expression) Hey, Kramer! I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open!
No they're not, they used to be.
Well there's always a place for you, on our team.
Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people?
Oh God, it's Joe Devola.
Tell me about it.
So she tought I did it to get back at her
Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out.
"I don't think I'm hungry"
Hi, happy birthday.
You did?!
Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.
Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up)
I was trying to be.
But....
Oh, hey Bania.
I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.
Whatever you want.
You chuck.
Elaine? What does she have to - (notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.) Oh no...
As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protg of my own.
Hey. (raises hands into fists of encouragement)
Hey!
There. Alright?
All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura opens the door and gets out). What? What?
Crazy Joe Divola
Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman anything you say she does!
I don't doubt it.
Well...
I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.
So... did you stop by the dojo?
Wood is good.
The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?
Maybe you won't like it.
He's... trying to get something off his chest.
Kramer , there's no way you're sleeping with me.
"Sometimes I tuck'em sometimes I don't"
Oh, Hi.
She said what?
Below the equator?
Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me.
Yeah.
That's their policy.
Yeah, but how could you be so sure?
Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah!
Ya, it's much better isn't it?
Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.
So...
Okay, thank you. (hangs up the phone)
You really used to have a think full head of hair.
You faked it?
Kramer! What are you doing?!
Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.
Hang on.
Well, I...
That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.
So, what did you do?
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
Let's see what he says.
Hey, George!
He had to use cork-screw pasta.
(to Kramer) ...( words missing)...laugh , everything's nice and at the end of the night I go for a little contact. I get the PULL BACK. This woman said the filthiest things I've ever heard in my life. I get the Pull Back.
Oh.
Sexual?
(reluctant) Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too.
Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.
George, big news; I'm getting married!!
No.
Hey, come on!
Its a joke.
You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.
You got a date with Becky Gelke?!
Oh...yeah...uh you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.
Hows he doing?
Exactly
Oh please, I love her.
Martine?
You got my spot?
You, sidle? Y-You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!
I hear things.
All right, I'll go
No, no, no, it's... "She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her."
Uhh...
What?
Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.
Almost. (Notices his shoes) Hey, new Timberlands?
I did it for you.
I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?
(on the phone) Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.
Everyday.
Don't you see?...........It's all a big scam.
(stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored)
Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign.
One more lane to go.
Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.
Well, maybe we should.
I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot.
Is she OK?
Who?
Oh...well...
You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I give you 50 bucks.
He's gone, George.
But this is what you've always wanted.
Yeah, so?
No openings in arson?
But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.
Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, "Those aren't buoys." (Father starts laughing) Father...
Elaine you're missing the whole point.
I don't wanna be Switzerland.
The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.
Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.
Yeah. You know, kind of a peace offering. Cute.
Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!
So, he's definitely married, huh?
Babu, may I say something?
Oh really?
(Still skeptical) No, he doesn't.
Oh, stop it.
C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something.
Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks.
Oh, Where did you eat?
George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.
(animated) They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!
Yeah, and youre just what shes looking for too  a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.
What for?
I want everyone out!
How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!
So?
George, the man wept.
hunky.. Tony.. hey hey hey (fools around with his collar again)
What do you mean you don't think so?
Hu, well, tomorrow, I, ...
Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.
That, that's tomato juice.
Pinkish hue?
Discount?
I never told you his name.
Kramer! (We hear Kramer's door slam open and shut. Kramer enters. Jerry comes out of his room.) Hey! Where's all my sneakers?
Yeah.
She's got really nice hair.
Did I?
They're not letting me in.
You don't even know what paba is.
No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!
(Nervous laughter) Yeah.. like a pirate.. (Attempting to get on another subject) Anyway, ah, you know, we're hoping to, um, raise enough money.. with this.. uh..
Eventually a little shot of penicillin
Read it out loud.
Hello Newman.
Yeah.
It's kinda private.
In the freezer.
Hey! Whattaya know!
"Well...........you know....."
I don't think the network will go for it.
(interrupting) Thanks, that's enough.
Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen.
Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?
No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.
(answering, quickly) If you know what happened in the Met game, dont say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, Im sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no
[forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell out of here!
You said "you little phony"?
No, what? Thats probably why..
They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.
You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples clothes
Hello.
I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
All right, let me ask you this when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?
She could have mentioned the conversation.
To my beautiful wife.
Where's Babu?
All right, bye. (to Elaine) You see this? Any thought pops into their head they're calling me because it's a local call now.
Why?
(glances at it) Pretty good.
Hi. Hi. Look, I don't know what you think --
Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?
What about?
I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...)
Real busy now down at the office?
No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.
Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting. I'd have to get new friends. I'd have to get orgy friends. ... Naw, I'm not ready for it.
Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!
(quietly) Oh, he's this awful comedian.
Just . . . do it.
You two know each other?
You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.
but not at Dinky.
Today, like right now.
Yes.
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
(Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.
Just a quick peek. I'm in agony.
Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing and
Oh, Kramer huh?
I'm not sending him to your house.
You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...
Are you that desperate?
Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've never heard anything like this in my life. Listen to this.
I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.
He said that?
I don't understand this..
(To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.
If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?
I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.
No! There's no T-bone!
It's 1030 in the morning?
We used to come in every day.
Yeah, let's just get out of here.
Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want? You're not a part of society.
(To Assistant) I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?
That was our babka. We had that babka!
Yeah. What does that mean?
Oh, come on!
Where are you going?
You know my parents are coming in and I got some clean up to do , so if you and Potsie are done scheming....
You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends....
I gotta say, thats pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.
She faked.
Yeah.
Come on up.
Hello?
Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door)
(To George) Well, it's not about nothing.
What happened to your head when you got hit?
The Coast,
No, no......(long pause . they stare at the walls) Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?
Hey, Bobby, over here.
NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.
Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry.
Aw!
That. (pointing at George)
It's like we're living in the '50s here.
Uh-huh.
Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.
Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George.
None.
(stands, puzzled, it's not sinking in) W-what do you mean?
ca.
...Yeah I am, but I just...(man hangs-up)
Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?
Why is he scared.
I think he's the same age as the father.
The dog?
So, uh, how are things with Jerry?
Hey, not bad. (pointing to crest) I kinda like this little thing here.
Uh-huh.
I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.
Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?
Oh, lithe!
We'll eat it in the movie.
(tossing the ball) Here you go.
No. No, no way, no Bania.
I just want a, touch em a little.
Hey, check the TV.
My jacket?
(to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?
So, she got you to join a book club?
Hey.
You use a Water Pik?
Congratulations!
If I told you, you woulda given it away.
How about a Napoleon?
"We're"? What do you mean, "We're"?
Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio.
Kramer's Andre, he's fooling around with these 976 numbers (Kramer walks out of the bedroom) hey I told you, I don't want you doing that on my phone
I didn't hear anything.
So, you two been, uh..
What do you mean? Why wouldn't I know his name?
What do you mean?
Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.
How do you know?
Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad.
Rabies.
Hey, isn't that George's father?
Me too!
Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?
I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.
They were all like that!
They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.
She is?
It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.
I see you, Newman! I see you!
What could you possibly like about that?
Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg.
What are you bringing snowballs in here for?
How do you account for this?
Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself.
What's your problem.
Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door.
What about little Joey?
I'm not a foodie. I don't, "Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty." Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book. What is this? The story of the bill? "Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.." What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating from the restaurant? What is this about?
Well what does this mean?
Hey you guys!
Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.
Sammy Davis had it.
What kind of look?
Keep your shirt on. I got it.
All right, fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone)
...the...the...
Why do you even need anybody?
Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal right now. (covers Jean-Paul with a blanket)
So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.
Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened. (listens) Well, I think you should. Okay, bye.
I'm watching Edward Scissorhands.
Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup of Decaf. (leaves table)
Desperado?
Hey. How'd it go with Gary?
Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, "This is good, who is this? I like this person". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, (pretending to wake up) "Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!"
But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.
I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad?
Well, senator, Id just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it.
Definitely. Well, goodnight.
(picks it up) I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table.
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.
All right.
What? (to George) What did, what did you say?
Yeah.
It's a schnoz.
What? She said that?
Couple of tough monkeys.
For what dinner?
(Pointing) He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..
You're right there.
(Giving Newman a sour look) I'm just hanging out in this hell-hole because of George.
Hey.
I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
What noise?
It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?
Wait a second, I--
(ranting) I can't believe how a little thing like George going too fast - and my whole weekend is gone - the plans, the packing, ... everything.
As soon as is humanly possible.
Well why doesn't he just come in?
What's the matter?
Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?
Yeah.,
What was all that sniffing?
Did I get a head start?
Vandelay Industries, Kel Varnsen speaking. May we help you? ... Oh Hi Keith. Na, I was just jokin' around
Don't ask me!
(dry) He knows.
Live?
Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--
A little
Look. Just, forget it, (already). All right?
Come on. Let's go.
No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.
Beats me.
But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.
"Oh! where's Jennifer today?"
Thats the bet! That youre not doing it!
Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him )
A deep, yawning chasm...
What are you doing here?
Hmm.
Why?
(Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here?
She flipped out! Just left.
How did she get Lyme disease?
Holly Go-Lightly.
Who makes copies?
Yeah, me too.
Bonkers?
Hey, can I have my dollar back?
Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.
Hey, Elaine.
That's what I do with him [points at George]
..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.
Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs phone up)
Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.
What the hell is a plantain.
Hm. You ate.
I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go "Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!"
Stop the mail?
Do you want to go with him? You go. I dont mind.
Yeah.
Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting.
What?
(to Ramon) Oh. Okay. (to Elaine) Wh, what is he doing here?
Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?
I don't know. What if I get caught?
Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.
Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.) You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?
Hey, George!
What?
Really? Since when?
(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.
In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?
I have no patience for lactose. And I wont stand for it. Um, Ill be right back.
Here we go.
(not) Oh. Too Bad.
You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool.
He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!
You can eat it?
Non-fat yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it.
Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding.
So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.
I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.
I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.
Hey, what happened to my jacket?
(starting the Dust Buster) What smell?
So what are you gonna do?
Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction.
I think you're getting a ticket.
I don't know.
But you gotta know how to work the projector.
She doesn't have toe thumbs.
Hey.
Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)
Yes, come on! How often do you get engaged? Come on!
Yeah.
Oh, come on!
Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?
(to himself) Hmm, testy.
Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do?
What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.
Ah, really.
I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?
Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
Grandpa clothes, I cant wear em.
We thought he was with you.
Good luck, It's sold out for the next three weeks.
C'mon. (They exit.)
I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?
No, its not you. Its your stomach, hes taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
Thanks , thanks
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.
"The Velvet fog?"
She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.
Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.
Hello.
George, we're trying to have a civilization here.
Is that so?
(interrupting) Can I talk to you for a second?
Oh sure like Monet.
So Kramer, what are you going to do?
Okay, Newman, thanks a lot.
Nice to meet you.
All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now, be reasonable you cannot turn down $50 for a $6 rye.
Give me the clothes.
Are you sure? Oh boy, here we go.
Were you crying? I mean, its just a grape. Youll find it.
(Takes the ticket back and looks at it, flips it over) The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too.
Oh no. That was the dry heaves.
Double zero?
Thats her! Shes here!
How can you do this?
A beard?
You ever go to Camp Tiyoga?
Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead.
Is it me?
Why didn't he tell me?
Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!!
Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.
(overhearing the other two Elaine, Elaine--
What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to Kramers door) Ah hah.
Oh, I cant begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.
It has nothing to do with whose house it is.
I believe he is wearing a cape.
(touching the back of his neck) It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.
Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I dont feel comfortable in them.
What about skunk?
(Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.
Ok, great, well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu.
But there's no "t" in your name. What about G-bone?
Yeah, I know.
I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.
In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.
No.
...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the patient!
How'd you find out?
Yes, yes, I heard.
Hi.
Can you get me a soda?
Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!
No. We gotta go to the soup place.
Hello, *Newman*...
You like the couch? Ill tell you what Im gonna do.
Alright, I'll see you later.
What happened to you, pal?
I have no idea.
No no no, dont interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what its doing. Just let it finish.
Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!
Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'?
Back together?
Okay, take it easy. (hangs up) That was Keith. we're going to do something next week.
I mean it's a terrible mistake, I mean he thinks I ruined some deal of his at NBC, I don't know anything about any deal at NBC.
Hello, oh hi Duncan, 400 o'clock tomorrow? That is not going to work. . . . Why? I'll tell you why. Because I chose not to run!
Oh, hi Rita.
Yes?
Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?
You're 40 minutes late. What happened?
I've seen her in your building.
You want me to take an overview?
I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?
Oh wait. Ill go with you.
Kramer, do you realize what's going on here? Do you know why you're here?
The big toe; The captain.
Let me just get my jacket.
I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. "The New Yorker is stealing my ideas." ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real.
That's from the car!
Yeahh.
Ah! What'd you find out, Lois?
Very tasty.
That's the last babka. They got the last babka.
Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.
Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.
Whatever it is.
Oh, nothing. (still giggling)
"What's that?"
Hello? Hello?
Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?
That's because she had my mail.
I don't understand. What don't you like about it?
Hello?
All right. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle Arbys no more than once a month. And in exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game, and doesnt read a book.
They sell them by the side of the road. Blueberry, Blackberry ....
The buzzer.
So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.
Babu!
Well we saw you come in.
He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?
Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday?
They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
Look, let me just give you the forty, plus another twenty for your trouble.
It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.
Yeah, well, I didnt- Is that something you want to borrow?
Never happened.
It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.
I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life.
(on the phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second. (George walks in  Jerry asks George) So we definitely dont want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes his head NO) Alright, were back together again, great. Bye bye.
You let him fight?
Let's go.
Another ending?
Hey Sid, what happened?
A little white dog?
Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.
Some of us.
What should I do? (to Alton) Uh, were taking a cab, arent we?
Well, that was the worst.
Well.
And he didn't remember you?
Boy, do you smell something?
Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.
I like the button fly.
I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.
I wouldn't use her toothbrush.
(shocked) What the hell was that?
Yes you did.
Sex, thats meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; thats heavy. Thats like an hour.
You want a gyro?
No, I haven't heard anything.
Yeah?
Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?
How could I have fleas?
The New York Yankees?!
Thats comforting. Shh. Hes coming. (to Ray) Ray?
Well women do it.
"What are you doing that for, you got a job"
No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it. (thinks out loud, opens phone book) Becker, ... Becker, ...
Well, that's your ceiling.
Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?
So what?
Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.
Yes I did.
What is that?
Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.
Home at last. Ahhhh. (light turns off)
Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane enters)
I gotta go meet Pam.
I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory.
She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?
You do of course try on, when you buy?
Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.
I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.
He's in Pakistan.
Hi tide?
How could you not care?
Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld.
Well, You can't go in there it's like a gas chamber in there.
How many sweaters you got on?
Pennypacker.
Well, well, well...
Opposite.
Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here.
Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't do you favors after you dump them.
All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?
What? (Kramer hands Jerry an envelope) My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it?
I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home.
What seems to be the problem, officer?
Are you okay? Did he bite ya?
You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?
"Why?"
Yeah?
Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?
He's definitely in Chicago.
Dude!
You dont think... What? The pony remark?
So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.
What clothes?
Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives. (Picks up phone and dials) Hello Tim? Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you? Well it turns out I can use them. Oh, you do? I understand. Okay. Bye. He already made plans, he can't change them.
George.
Yeah, he seems pretty happy.
No, you wait for the movie!
All right.
Well, what about the ponytail?
I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.
So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.
Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.
I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and Ill just make up some excuse why I cant go to the game either.
Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be.
What is that, the Empire State Building?
Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.
The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..
(taking the envelope) Wh..What's this?
Well, I painted my apartment again. Ive been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, its a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize its just the thickness of the paint, but Im aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, its closer and closer. I dont even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. Thats where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control... Thats why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching TV. Thats why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there.
We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.
Aw.. right, code of silence.. how's that going?....Ha!!...
Why not?
It's gotta have something to do with Kramer
Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs.
Fine. Well.
Fifty years they were married. Now hes moving to Pheonix.
What? What news?
So you had a good time.
(to waitress) I' ll just have a cup of coffee.
of course you would
Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine.
My stomach, I , think it was that cookie.
yeah stinks, terrible
If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.
Hi.
Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.
(He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.
I think thats the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!
Mickey Mantle?
hello.. Erika
(consternation) Oh no. (to the bedridden two) It's go time.
Good evening, Rabbi.
So, what did she have to say?
Oh, how come?
(Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together?
There isn't?
You're returning used fruit?
What strike?
(Trying to explain) Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past.
(taking the envelope) Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em.
Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?
Would I have to get a gardener?
Sons of bitches?
Wow.
oh I'm sorry I didn't get most of that.. isn't that Kramer over there?
(on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel! (hangs up the phone very disappointed)
More cereal? that's your third bowl today, you had it for breakfast and lunch.
Good idea. (Jerry calls Barry's office)
Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.
What's the difference?
Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.
Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?
Nothing, what's doing with you?
I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers?
HUGE pop-in guy!
You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story??
Confucius, huh?
Birds?
You just met the guy yesterday.
For what?
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!
You got evens.
Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing.
So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?
All right.
Elaine?
We'll still make the movie.
I don't care.
Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house?
(neutral) Fine.
I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce you get impeached and you're not even the president!
Will you marry me?
What?
Let me just wipe the sink.
(Pulls the note out of his pocket) That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.
How long has she been there?
Let me get a clean pair. (Goes into his room. George strides over to the window.)
I'm asking Elaine to marry me.
What is the point of all this?
Oh! There coming to town tomorrow by the way.
Well we went out one time. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
(frustrated, to self) The whole system is breakin' down!
Oh, excuse me... Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.
Good thing the cleaning lady was there.
You're a baby!
He left me there. You see the mind games?
Yeah, Friday's okay.
No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.
Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?
I'll loan you my puffy shirt.
What?
Here. I got your money.
Can you relax, its a cup of coffee. Claire is a professional waitress.
Then it does exist.
All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go.
(looks in the creamer) Theres no milk in here, what...
(pause) All night?!
That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.
Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.
Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?
You're an idiot.
Elaine, he doesn't need-
(Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.
Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning...
"What about the Velvet Fog ?"
Scarf?
You read during lunch?
She does have a way.
Ohh, will not cause drowsiness"
Course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.
Lets talk about that.
Is there a captain's hat involved in this?
Hey, there's uncle Milty.
I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend.
Anything's *possible*...
5-19? What's a 5-19?
Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.
Youre an architect?
I mean, she called me. I havent called her. She started it.
Really? It felt good.
Oh.
(Pleading) Really, gentlemen, please.
You said that?
(returning to the table) Remember Babu Bhatt?
No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.
But the whole car smells.
I didnt even think to look.
But you gotta like their chances.
There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.
Well, thats it. Look, Im going to Vermont. I dont want to think about this. Im selling.
So your saying UNICEF is a scam?
Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?
O.K. from now on I want you to call me "Jerry the Great".
No, nothing.
Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.
Why would I leave? This is my apartment.
Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?
I don't know.
So, how did you get up there? Did you say you had to use the bathroom?
I want that picture.
Really.
Come on.
We dont have two seconds?
What are they for?
Absolutely
So?
Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' "Where's your jock strap?" Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.
Yeah, I'm free, why?
Well, you're looking well.
George, you're thinking too much.
I don't mind the Mayans.
Friday?
Morning.
Clever.
Good, good.
Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.
All right we'll wait for you.
(a lightbulb goes on in his head) Riverside Drive.
No. No Suze.
Babu?!
Game?
Is my toaster oven on there?
(Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.
Come on up.
Frankly, I'm a little concerned.
Hey!
He used to go there a lot on business.
Yes.
George, does your father speak Korean?
That's it?
What did you do about them?
George, this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on. (Jerry leaves.)
Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing "no") A little taste! (still shaking) Come on. (still shaking)
(Scoffing) Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.
Oh, that's classy.
See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey George, look, I'm not funny now.
That's my car!
Ok.
Oh, I got to see this thing.
Is the flounder here yet?
Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
Boy.
Hey.
I can't figure out what's going on here. I can't follow the plot. Why did they kill that guy? I thought he was with them?
Yeah, but--
You got the picnic and burger traffic.
I mean, if were gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.
Excuse me?
It's not totally impossible.
Too bad.
From that woman at NBC?
So where you gonna sleep?
How'd you do on the IQ test?!
You're not undoing anything.
What did you end up giving her?
How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable special . I 've never gotten a cable special.....well that's it I'm not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado. (to the silent Kramer on the couch beside him) ...Exactly.
Did you get that at Joe's?
Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.
wait, where are you going? where are you going?
It's not here.
No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.
Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.
Help yourself.
All right, what is this?
Yeah.
Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.
And what do I say about you?
So take a cab.
So lemme get this straight you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an clair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, "What the hell, I'll just eat some trash."
How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!
Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame.
Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.
Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.
Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.
She's bald?
"What the hell's going on over there?"
How did you lock your keys in the car?
(humouring him) That's very nice.
Really?
I didnt know. Kramer told me about the worlds.
Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime.
(To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. (Gestures to a black Saab)
Well, so it wasn't a total loss.
Ok
Bania?
What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.
(Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So we're on for later?
With the little legs?
Kramer.
Imagine, spelling Mom with two Os.
Yeah! So
What're you gonna talk about?
Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.
I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy.
What?
Yeah, maybe you won't.
Uh huh.
Are you alright?
(Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.
Hey, what happened to your coat? And what is the smell? Is-ya, What are you drunk?
(simultaneously) I hate you!
According to them
(watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this?
I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.
Played cards last night.
(stares at George, incredulous) "Back on"? What was it doing off?
So ,Who is he?
Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions.
I know.. How about dessert?
(after the guy) You think you're better than me?
No, he didn't use 'man'.
Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- Ill be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too.
Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone)
Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.
Ooh-ooh
It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something.
Oh. thank you.
Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.
Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you do likewise.
He was what?!
(To George) You're givin' him back that TV.
Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.
Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.
Hi.
Get together?
No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.
He wont take ya..
I can't believe she threw out my napkin.
Okay.
Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.
Hello Newman.
Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a...
Yeah. You said you liked horse manure.
I know, I know.
"Glamour"?
If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.
Odds.
Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, thats a good idea.
You're not paying for it.
Gillian. Hiii..
Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.
Name tags?
Please.
(To Amy) Aha! So it's true! You were making out with him!
There's a squeeze ketchup.
How could I what?
(zipping up his bag) Sometimes you do.
It's alright, I want you to have it.
(impressed) Who's that?
Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.
Tatiana...
More sheets per roll
Ah, you're screwed.
What?!
They make wigs out of human hairs?
I don't want a van.
(bewildered) Four-thirty? Who eats dinner at four-thirty?
Listen, Ma...
About what?
Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad it's Klompus.
Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.
Well this is very awkward.
No.
I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.
Oh, no, uh, go ahead. You got a pen?
Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips.
Go again?
(motions of making out) Well you were involved in some sort of amorous...
What did he say?
Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.
Don't feel right? What are you talking about?
And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.
(to Kessler) Yeah. (to the phone) Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem.
Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.
(Shocked at his parents) You're stealing too?!
You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.
(to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)
I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?
He's a little backed up.
Dont you think she woulda heard I was there?
She could be an 'it'.
It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.
I...don't remember.
You certainly are. What's going on?
to basically give this money away-
He's been sleeping a lot. He's still groggy.
Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
What is your problem?
Hey Alec
Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.
Hey.
No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, hes treatin me just like a regular customer, now!
What the hell is that?
You know I'm paying for these tickets.
She's pretty. She's not beautiful.
You don't understand, ah
Why?
Well, whaddaya wanna do here?
(jocular) Eighteen-fifties?
Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?
When did you get tickets to see that?
Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.
What did you say?
"Really!"
I don't get this. How did this happen. I don't have a dog.
Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes.
Oh, Im sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.
Yeah.
I cant blame you. I cant believe she never called you back.
(pulling on a jacket) They had a cancellation and they instantly called me.
Are you sure?
No, nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table)
I would like to propose a toast....Wait a second.. George! George Costanza come in here.
You're lying! You got it, I want that number!
Ok, I'll see you around the building.
It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it.
(To George) You're off bread. (To Elaine) So what happened is it over?
Well, I . . . [sees George]
Well I think I get the gist of it.
Oh, so there's still hope.
I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that couldn't be.
(sarcastically) No you don't..
This is insane. You know, I dont even know where shes staying! She, shes not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.
...I got you an apartment in this building.
Fred, do you know Elaine?
You faked with me?
Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it!
Take some of mine.
Oh, I turned my jacket inside out.
Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers?
Why?
Cat fight with Raquel Welch.
George, I am loving this no wallet thing.
All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? (sits opposite George)
Kramer, what are you doing here?
Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?
Hey. The butler's here.
He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly . I would like to have a good show.
yeah that should be real fun
I don't know what this is.
Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?
(standing) How much d'you want for it?
Hey.
Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)
(To Kramer) Thank you.
I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
Nodding off...
What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him?
What does that mean?
I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!
I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.
Lord of the manor.
Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.
Yeah, he's a bad seed.
Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.
George, is this funny?
Wonder about what?
Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.
Why?
I'm nauseous.
Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.
Jerry.
Hey.
And a dead bolt.
Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, "Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land." (Imitates cannon operator) "I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you."
I don't know what you should do with it.
All right, here!
Bye.
Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
Where's Kramer?
Thank you.
Heeyyy!...
Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going "Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going."
Well?
What tee?
Oh, I had that comin' to me.
Yeah. Yes, she is.
Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery.
Where's George?
I don't think that's it.
What are you gonna do with it?
No lines.
How can I ever have you over? Youll sit there moping.
By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks.
Yes, he is.
No, no. Its not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, its not like Marlenes a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, weve had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling. (George nods.) And its these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if Im busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and shes in the middle of a sentence!
All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.
"No...Got dental appointment."
His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I wouldve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. Hes so self-involved.
I'm clean and you know it.
Yep. Since college. (Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.) Hey, Lena Small's on this list.
So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that...
Itll take two seconds.
No, I guess shes still mad.
Aaahhhhh!!
All right Newman, one more peep outta you, you're out of the whole operation!
What is that?
But you yada yada'd over the best part.
So you put down my money?!
(noncommittal) Errh.
All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter)
You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal.
I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.
He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.
When do you intend to do this?
You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
What?
Would you stop?
Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side.
I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.
Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?
Well, that's very interesting.
No.
I thought they smelled pretty nice.
I don't wanna use your car.
Yeah, we'll see ya.
(cuts in) A nude model.
Its very good cantaloupe. (Kramer leaves; to George) So thats it? Youre out?
(to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...
What do you need them for?
I'm in show business.
Babu, you're Pakistani, right?
Eh, what?
Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!
Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?
(closing the door on him) Oh!
Oh look at this guy.
She's drunk out of her mind.
There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.
Raspberry, Strawberry ...
(laughing) Really? What a shock.
She's not there!
It's not that hard.
Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?
(pause) All right, sir.
Does she hate cigarettes?
Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see her tonight.
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!
The whole block, forty, fifty cars.
(looking ahead) Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh.
Thousand.
Well yes I did that's true. A couple of a guys I knew in the coastguard told me about her.... and I sensed that she had the anger and intensity that I needed to make this film work.
Yeah.
I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
Great, I love Newman! (Eagerly following Kramer)
Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, Yeah, I got this new thing Platonic. My idea, my name, callin it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- dont do anything, and go right home. Whatd you think? I think its going to be big! I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didnt work. Yknow, I bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, Uh, Hi, uh my names Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, its a Riconic relationship.
No, no I don't. Why?
Yeah, sounds like fun.
Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.
Hey, what are ya up to?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I have an instinct for these things.
Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.
Huh?
Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.
Yeah.
"All right."
How's your family history?
I'll see you later.
Is that still from the cats?
George, Marla.
Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?
What?
But wait a minute...
Come on.
So what are you gonna do?
Russia, it's so bleak.
Oh yeah, that's the spot...
You wanna grab lunch?
Is not.
(Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.
Pam!
Who is that woman?!
(In pain) Oh, are you about done?
Yeah?
Well, the pickle breath is a good start.
But I never walk you home.
She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults. Things you would know very little about.
Something huh?
That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry.
Mr Mandelbaum, please.
I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.
Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.
All right, make it the large sodas.
Ah, I think I'll go.
The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.
How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!
Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews.
Yeah, that's part of it. (sniffs) Kasha?
(continuing) The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.
Not this movie.
I cant. I got to meet Clare.
With me?
Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?
You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now.
I don't know , Who keeps track of Hellos.
And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.
What?
You're going to make a good father someday.
This Wednesday?
...Guess so.
I have to do what?
Eh.
An assembly?
Ah, you're out of your mind.
How's your confidence level?
You know you're not supposed to drink while you're keeping a secret! (Elaine laughs) Is there anything else?
No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.
No, don't stop, Kramer. Keep going, don't let him get away.
All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?
Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?
Tell her what?
(in a hurry) Ya how you gonna get all this done in time?
Gee, I never thought of that.
No she didn't.
Hello? Oh, hi Stu.
Why?
You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.
Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)
"Jimmy?
Yeah.
What?
Yes I am skeptical.
Ideally.
Come on in here.
Oh yeah, hold on.
Youre engaged?
I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.
What is all this?
It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination. I would have killed this man. Torn him limb from limb, ripped the flesh right off his bones ...
Ah ha.
(lacking enthusiasm) Yeah, yeah.
So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?
What are you doing?!
Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.
No.
Maybe you should check with the rabbi.
Believe me I didn't see anything.
I got it! (snaps his fingers) We give the keys to Elaine.
Did you tell Peterman about this?
What?
Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind.
Beautiful!
Well...
(To himself) Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. (George doesn't react) What's the matter?
What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?
Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!
I guess you can take anything, but actual work.
I'm not kidding.
Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye.
Oh, no...
Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. (They go out into the hallway and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.) Hey, how ya doin.'
Really, I'm sorry. Maybe another time.
No more crutches, that must be a relief.
I didn't know that...
So what happened?
Did you get your laundry?
Yeah, that's a point...
I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.
NBC?
It's not necessary.
Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone? You wanted the machine. You know, and you're always kind of thrown off, (left hand up to side of face, pretending its a receiver) you go "Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you."
Right.
A phony? He called me a phony?
It appears that way.
(grabs the ticket back) Give me that.
There are ways.
You know why? Because people like to say "salsa." "Excuse me, do you have salsa?" "We need more salsa." "Where is the salsa? No salsa?"
You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS!
Sadly, that knowledge could've help me.
You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.
I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.
"Jerry"!
Yeah. What's wrong, why? ( George runs back to the bathroom)
Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price?
All right, I gotta go.
Okay. Thank you, very much.
Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail.
(Pleading) Leo..
I asked. Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian football.
you're fine (goes to the bathroom)
It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman.
And it's probably a union thing.
We have an appointment!
That was him?
$875?
You're a lunatic.
So what was wrong with him?
Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now?
Prognosis *negative*!?
Where's George
What is that smell?
And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises.
Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what are you doing?
She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love!
What? No.
Hello, Newman. What gives?
That bothered you?
(to George) Is that uh, other apartment still available?
In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?
Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!
Yeah! me too
Why?
What do you mean that's it?
Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.
What?
This stuff on top is my friends. Could I get it done in a separate machine?
No, I dont.
It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
You gotta go to my chiropractor, hes the best.
Did you talk to her?
Another Caf Latte?
Yeah and?
Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know its missing, and he took it! And of all things to take! I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. Hes crazy.
Well, maybe I'll just take it back.
It's okayit's just a hot dog, (still sobbing) everything is going to be okay.
You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.
I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton.
(also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it.
Well, so that's that.
Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way.
You thought I was gonna get married?
Giddee up!
Very strange.
Why does he do that?
Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a person could still make a mistake like that.
It's the new J. Peterman catalog. Look.
Sorry. I don't have any tupperware.
Hey.
I guess they leave that up to the general population.
(standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. (indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.
You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.
You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.
Get out of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The Heart Attack')
(to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here.
Then what'd you come down here for?
You shut up.
(dismissive) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this?
Look at my picture!
Youre in there again.
She had man-hands.
Boy, that is some kick.
Didja leave a message?
I know.
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em. (starts backing away as Kramer follows him around the room carrying the underwear)
I better not.
I am challenging.
Green suit, power ring.
A Willard? Saccamano, Sr. screwed me!
Hi, Beth!
What, what is wrong with her?
I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.
Thank you...
That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it.
Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model.
Bon voyage, Lainey!
Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.
Yeah, I think you would.
Can he communicate?
Wow. That really is nothing.
Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.)
Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.
How could you not?
Ya, see ya.
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
[quizzically] Live together?
Good, good.
Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?
Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.
Are you okay?
All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.
No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1,900 dollars.
Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.
Well, I'm a prospective member.
I didnt know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrants going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesnt make sense. Am I wrong?
Who thinks you're smart?
No, I don't drink coffee.
Hey, I just said it was stupid.
When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.
And what, hope for a crash?
...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.
Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didnt like the looks of the defense and changed the play.
Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy.
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?
(picking up the phone and dialing) It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.
Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in your friend John Germaine's band there.
Hey, look whose here - Puddy.
Nah, he didn't make it.
Maybe we should go.
It's a monkey, Kramer!
Oh, thats okay.
(jocular) You got any kids?
Sure. Why not? You're there.
Rhode Island.
Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)
First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.
Defent.
You've caught your mother opening envelopes!
On your heart?
There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing *just* a bra. I can't get that image out of my mind.
So where're we eatin'?
Great.
All right.
I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.
No, I dont think so. Ive seen you two together. You make each other miserable. Its kismet.
Boy, the resemblance is uncanny.
Youre doing this yourself?
Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner.
See ya.
I don't know. (takes off his sweater) This sweater really itches me. You want it?
I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.
(to the door) Yeah?
What's with the fake sneezing?
Please, Donna...
Oh, look! There's Gregory Peck's bicycle!
Yeah.
Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.
I forgot my toothbrush.
(holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the fridge?
Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?
You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.
Oh the baby's fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt.
oh, I d-I don't know. I d---
Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man.
They're not making higher roofs.
Hmm..
I'd be happy to.
Hey.
(To himself) I don't believe this! (Walks over to a security guard) Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with shoplifting..
you know I'd like to hear about this job of yours
Yeah.
Okay. Thanks.
(in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine) So did you figure out Darryl's... you know.
Why don't you put it in the *bank*?
Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it.
I'M NOT DOING YOUR BITS!!
Last week on Seinfeld.
Sure, Beth, these things happen. (Brief pause) So, have you told many.. people yet?
Oh, I don't believe this.
Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.
Ah, the power lunch crowd.
No, I had to tell my friends  my friends didnt have to tell you.
You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown?
What?
Good evening, folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--
'51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?
Self-esteem?
Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?
Is he on the plane now?
Seeya.
How about when Harrison Ford jumped out of that plane, and he was shooting back at them as he was falling?
Yes you would.
Oh, so hopelessness is the key.
I cant believe youre here.
Here we go.
(to Kramer) It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Wheres she gonna get five thousand? She doesnt have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. Shes gone. Then you come in, Why dont you loan her five thousand? What do you care? Youve got five thousand. Give her five thousand!
I dont know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I cant decide.
Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)
You knocked him out.
wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to just sense it's in front of the couch?
(Out of it) Huh?
(to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!
(CONT'D) Hmmm...I thought it was...
What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.
No, forget it, I'm gonna call.
How you gonna get me up there?
I know the list...
I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.
Oh, sure, yeah.
Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drakes coffee cake
In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.
But its common sense. Hes got super strength, super speed. Im sure hes got super humor.
The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.
Is this yours or the roommate's?
So you're enjoying the not enjoying.
Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second. Hello.
(reluctant) Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy.
hey hey (fooling around with his collar)
Almost.
Hey.
Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours.
What are you gonna do there?
Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)
Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents.
"Caught" you? Doing what?
Just go back and ask him again. (Slams the door on Kramer)
Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.
Wow! (hitting George)
Why shouldn't I go here?
You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.
OK, I blame you.
It's not a valet, it's a protg.
(indicating the woman) Game, set and match, huh Milos?
No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.
Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. Its completely shrunk. Theres absolutely no way I can wear it.
Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. (And to George) What do you mean you can't tell me?
I'm sorry, uh-
But an 85?
Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
But I could do that and the music.
Bob Cobb.
Are you O.K. in here?
Hey.
(writing) Here's my address and number. And really, thanks again.
First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.
Hey, how was baby-sitting?
How 'bout if it was something like " I can't find my receipt my place's a stye.
Youre gone all right.
What are you talking about?
For the apartment.
What happened to your mental alarm?!
All right. Flush twice.
Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?
Y'hello.
So what's this job?
Since college.
Great, how about you?
But you can never keep a secret.
I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble. I'll do it myself.
Hey.
If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.
He might not want nothing.
(in a tuxedo) So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a woman that won't have sex with you.
Is that so?
He went crazy from one note. He couldnt get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.
...C'mon.
Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.
Well maybe he's got like a, cheerful mental hold on you.
Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.
Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.
A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?
He is the gambler.
You quit the post office?
Oh yeah, I heard all about it.
I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses!
Ooh, (to Elaine) case closed!
What's with you?
I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?
I love the day date. No wine, No shower.
Just, look, just give the keys.
I told you!
Oh yeah I like this idea.
Yeah?
Where are you sitting?
I can see that! What happened?
I did. Im just curious. Its been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points? (to Vanessa) Its up six points!
Oh, you don't know.
Why are we flyin' over the Andes?
Aw! You'll be fine, you were in there for what , a couple of minutes.
She died? Mrs. Hudwalker died?
Yeah.
Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these types of people.
Yes. Melrose Place.
I'm callin' Elaine. See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley.
Hiss!
Oh, you know what?
(still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?
Hello.
I got my health.
Who goes to the hospital to rest?
How did you know they were defective?!
Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.
Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything. Why don't we all just go to Paris?
Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?
Hey, I thought you went to the game.
"I think I was tucked.!"
No. It's still a goodbye.
You think he's faking?
Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.
What are you doing here?
Well, let's confront 'em.
What writer? It's a sitcom.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! (haha)
I know, and then you say to yourself, From this moment on, Im not gonna waste any more of it. But then you go, How? What can I do thats not wasting it?
Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?
(CONT'D) You want me to help you with that?
Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal.
Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?
Okay.
Why not?
What do you recommend?
Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.
Oh, hey Mike.
Crazy kids, huh?
What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?
Me?
Yeah, Ill have the egg salad on whole wheat.
Ah! right...nice. Lunch with Elaine?
Oh, that's too bad.
Hey! Wait up!
Not all of 'em!
Tremendous girl.
Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.
Uh, hang on a second, You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck.
Bye. (Hangs up)
What could you have done?
What about Elaine?
Oh, no.
I'm too tired.
Comes in a wide variety of colors.
Whats the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!
What is it?
Are you okay?
You're a lucky guy.
The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?
What're you, "Joe Hollywood"?
No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy.
Nice shotgun.
I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table.
Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.
Midnight Express, my friend.
I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.
With all the nudity?
There's really not that much to tell.
(protesting) I..I didn't say that.
Another babka?
Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. (George gives Elaine a look while Jerrys back is turned. Jerry turns around.) I saw that.
Loleola?
(Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?
Just like that?
What if hes in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (Jerry knocks on imaginary glass.) How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? (He makes a hissing sound.) By the way, whats happening with Sendrax?
(nervous) What?
You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?
Well, go in there and talk to her. She's not going to put em on the glass.
Your friend, Noreen.
(to Kramer) What are you doing here?
I heard you say something, there.
Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.
Do you want it?
You did?
How'd you get yours?
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.
No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?
I have some idea.
You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while, no matter how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because they're crawling , crawling on your skin. Up your legs , up your spine , up your back.....
Not if they don't know you...
They deliver wood?
No chance.
This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
Oh I'm stressed! (makes like Kramer, outstretching his arm. Jerry heads for the freezer for some ice cream.)
You must be George's cousin.
No. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
You know how they do that?
Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.
(In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so.
No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
What?
Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune.
Why?
I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin else.
Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.
Still no luck
Well, she's... like you.
Yeah, that's a deal. That's a terrible deal. I don't want to go out to dinner with him. Id rather make my own suit.
(to George) So did you bring the lease? (George takes the lease from his inside pocket and hands it to Jerry.) All right, gee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time.
Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.
So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. Its a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and Im supposed to feel bad. Is that the way its supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldnt you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. Cause its not easy to give someone the toe, youve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... (Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) Look at that toe, buddy. (He puts his foot down.) I mean, thats really insulting to get the toe, isnt it?
Alcohol.
You could take it? You want it?
Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.
Yes. A bubble boy.
Sorry about the Olympics.
Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.
Never.
Really?
No, no, no ugly side.
Well, I'm calling this off right now.
(thinking) Well, the drive home should be a delight. Im speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I dont care. (to Vanessa) That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room?
How's life on the red planet? (shuts door)
No tippy toe.
Elaine, would you marry me?
Make them interesting.
Yeah. And she picked the day!
(Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really?
That doesn't sound right.
Just had a big bowl of Kix.
Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?
Can't you at least die with a little dignity?
So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?
I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going "I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?
Did he kiss you good night?
Hey - hey - hey!
George I'm telling ya..
I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation. The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?"
I always feel bad for the silver medal winner in the Olympics. How do you live with that the rest of your life? People are gonna keep asking, "- How much did you lose by? - I don't even know...! It was like...(very fast) now.now...now.now..now..was like, like... now..now..now...! It was it...! Eh, it was it and I lost. I trained, I worked out, I exercised, I did everything, I was doing push-ups, sit-ups, I never did anything but exercise and work out for 20 years, I flew half way around the world and aaaaaaaaaah!...(showing a tiny distance between his index and thumb) And that was...it was a photo-finish! Silver...(stretching his neck forward)...gold. If I had a pimple, I would've won.
You're pretty comfortable up there eh, Bubble boy?
Why not?
Why'd you get him a gift anyway?
Are you insane? Give 'em to me.
Too domestic.
I know.
I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved.
(Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.
Horse manure?
Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal [and, ala Carson] Wild, Wild, Stuff...
(reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.
Of course I want to talk about it.
How'd that happen?
(picks up the phone on the coffee table) 555-3455. Well wait a second, don't you see that's 555-FILK.
Super bowl! Hey, an original G.I. Joe. (picks up both items) With a full frogman suit.
I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?
That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it. (throws watch in garbage)
Kramer! The stone!
Where did I take it? Where Did I Take It? (stabbing a knife into a cutting board) Umm, to that place on, uh Columbus and 85th. Okay?
A smirk?
You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.
Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.
(to George) I mean, come on. (a thought occurs) No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from *Seals and Croft*.
I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
Do you have to write all this stuff down.
Bye.
Yeah, Queens.
Well why are you going?
OK, see you later.
You kissed her?
So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show, I waited for you, you never came.
An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. (Elevator doors open) Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. (Everyone but Jerry is now in the elevator. Jerry's still addressing them) Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?! (Elevator doors shut. A few people in the hallway are looking at him, he turns and addresses them) I am not an animal!
A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see 'em. Come on, I'm calling! (thumps hand on table) What d'you got!
Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?
(passing Hallie) 'Scuse me.
How do you like that?
(rising) I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the speed-dial.
Hey, where's Kramer?
Thank you very much.
What happened to the car?
Elaine, George (introducing them to Bania with less enthusiasm)
Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.
I'm in the book and I have a machine.
Well you should hear the message from my nut. Where's George and Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, I feel very vulnerable.
Stairmaster?
(reading) Jewish singles night?
The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke. (The phone rings.) Thats probably Uncle Leo.
(not interested) Oh, I'm sure they are.
c'mon, c'mon....
So quit!
I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.
Yeah...
You dont know Robert Schumann? The composer?
(no amused) Fantastic.
Hey, woahoh Fulton. It's me.
So after the sucking, comes the weaning.
George, Stacey.
Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10?
Oh... yeah. What? I'm sorry.
Good shake. Perfect shake. Single pump, not too hard, you know, doesn't have to prove anything, but, you know, firm enough to know he was there.
All the time.
Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!
Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?
Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.
Audrey.
You fell on her?
Not good
Girls. There's girls right here in the store. Look, look, there's one over there. Look, there's another one. Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there. What's the matter?
youre a real pleasure. (Jerry is being sarcastic)
Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.
Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, is that you?
George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long.
Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, (looking at the TV) Kramer, turn that up.
She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.
No. I can't say as I have.
Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.
Not that I would think of doing such things.
I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!
George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?
(urgent whisper) Elaine.
Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up.
He's looking on to fridgerator.
Wow! (Jerry spots all the classic toys)
Very good looking.
George? (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.
I dont need any more.
You mean that wasn't uh.
No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.
"Yeah!"
No question about it.
Yeah. So you really like this guy.
What are we gonna do?
Yeah?
Have you ever spent any time with these people...?
Oh, God.
How much did you give him?
Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person -
Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?
How could you not believe me?!?
You don't know? Come on, that's gold!
Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.
(TO GEORGE, REWOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?
There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?
How long is this gonna go on?
Where'd you get plans?
Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat!
I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.
How did you get my package?
A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.
Is it Famous Ray's?
What's the matter?
You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.
Big matzoh ball.
Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?
Nooo, I don't. (the elevator doors shut)
All right we're coming down.
All I know he was sniffing.
So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) "Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again." They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system..."Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to the plane in my apartment." You see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet "hide-a-key" under the wing..."maybe he left it up there somewhere..."
Come on up.
Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist enters Monk's)
You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!
(thinking) So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?
As a guy I dont know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I dont know how to say, Bill, I feel I need to see other men. Do you know what I mean? Theres nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think thats the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because theyre two guys. Thats almost all we need to have in common. Cause sports  sports and women  is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, So, whats in the refrigerator?
Ya, that's the.. last thing you want to see. Well, next to last.
I'll wait.
Ohhhhh.. John-John.
This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!
Why don't you get somebody else?
(proud of himself) Remember me? I said I 'd come back with someone and I did. Surprised?.
Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable.
She seems very nice.
Hey. What's all this?
Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket.
These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86.
Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.
Were friends.
What did you have to give your TV away to George for?
Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail.
Oh, hello.
Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?
You gotta be there at 430.
Yeah!
What do you tip a wood guy?
So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.
Yeah.
She likes talking during sex.
So she didnt get the messages.
What are you gonna do about the roommate?
All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, "It's been real," move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.
You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?
No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.
It's early.
Yeah.
I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
How long did that last?
I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. Shes going to move in.
George, the phone's free.
What's the matter?
The chip-in!
Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's.
She's too good.
You're not worried about that?
So take it.
Come on, Go in, go in! [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again]
So what? You're entitled.
Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for show.
It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?
Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years.
What's the matter?
(privately amused) Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while. (indicating Elaine) Her too.
We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.
(To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.
You?
What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?
Well, why not?
Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?
(Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat.
I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.
Great day in the morning.
Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?
Youre wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!
Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...
Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?
Maybe we should call this off.
We're with him, we're with him.
Back to my place. That's right.
These pretzels are making me thirsty.
(getting worked up) I don't need the money.
Hey, isn't that Michael's car?
Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.
Huh?
Yep.
(TO KRAMER, REBOX) Will you let me help you with that?
I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?
Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.
Oh.
Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didnt want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And its been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. (to Kramer) All right, so, just take what you want and lets get it out of here.
We're behind you, Aquaboy. Godspeed!
Yes. Right above me.
Hurry up George! Step on it!
Those two?
And, best of all, it's a Cadillac.
Hello... Oh hello Elaine.
Skin cancer! Damn.
I did.
So tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?
What's the expiration date on that?
Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly) and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it.
So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out (as mortician) 'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'. (as Mrs Costanza, horrified) Aahh!
Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.
What happened?
You don't know?
Yeah!
Soon as I get off the phone wih you.
You want the tickets?
No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.
Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.
yeah,
Again
Whatever.
So, Puddy wear's a man fur?
We were just playin.'
Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.
(not enthousiastic at all) Oh, sure. Danny.
What do you say?
Ah..........
Oh, why not?
This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!
All right, very funny. I get it.
Really!
Happy Festivus!
Sure.
Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!
So you're not gonna come?
Your parents are crazy!
World War I plane?
Oh so what.
So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?
I don't mind at all. Why should I mind? What did he say?
(nonplused) You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?
What's going on? You're the man of the hour, That's what's going on.
Got lost? We went to school here for three years.
You tried.
What? All right, fine.
Whew
I want the antidote, pimple popper!
What for?
Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.
Im just gonna get my jacket, Ill meet you downstairs. Whats the matter, did you call?
Howard Metro.
Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend. (puts his arm around Elaine's shoulder, but she shrugs it off twice)
Yes!
What are you talking about?
We could talk.
Who?
(coughing) I said, boy am I ugly.
No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.
Drakes Coffee Cake
I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I dont get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, Im not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, theyre so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, thats it! Its the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we dont know bout that, we dont know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas weve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! I dont think she likes me. The amazing thing is, that we still get women, dont we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. Thats why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like Where to meet men? Were here, we are everywhere. Were honking our horns to serve you better.
Ya.
Yeah
Hmm. That looks new.
When did you get that?
(Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?
Does she know?
I don't want to stop her!
Oh, you didnt...
So you want to go to the party on Friday night?
Boy, your really packing it all in.
Oh, what about this one? Look at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for. (Sits on the couch.) Oh, yeah!
Good.
What do you mean you show up?
Keep following him Kramer. don't let me down.
Indeed.
(to Kramer) So how's your karate class going?
I like sneakers.
(pleading) I got a date. C'mon, please.
Alright. Forget it.
They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.
No, I'll be back.
AH. Yes that's gonna make a big difference.
Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. (Elaine smiles and rolls her eyes at him) What brings you here?
Sorry, really.
Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh...
(Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.
Uh, good.
What's going on here. How is that possible?
I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!
Really?
It's all taken care of.
They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same.
Why?
... if this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this woman to help me I would have killed this man. I would have strangled the life out of him with my bare hands
A preemptive breakup.
I'm with you.
(acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?
What's his name?
I dont wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do you think?
Would you tell Susan about it?
Too thin?
This is too much.
What? Leave? Where? Why?
George!
How do you pull that off?
Is that right?
No I can't I've got some stuff to do then I've got to meet Keith at my apartment at three. I'm helping him move.
Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue.
Got what?
Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?
Bye.
Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear?
It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me.
-programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'
Quone? No, Im afraid that Im going to have to challenge that.
You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!
Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?
Sing it, sister!
You know its not like changing toothpaste.
How is it a write off?
We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!
Oh, alright ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....
Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity. 5? 3? Oh, it was just an expression. All right, well, that's very sweet of you. Okay, I'll call you later. All right, bye. Hey!
I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
Oh, good.
My car? You drove it into the swamp!
(answering the buzzer) Yeah?
But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.
Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'?
You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?
Really, an intervention ...
It's here!
I don't know.
I like the way you think.
Hey, Kramer, over here.
I'm trying.
(Stern on George) Not underpants.
I don't know.
She sees something in him.
You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for?
(to himself) Once a week? (to Uncle Leo) So how's Lydia?
Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?
(pointing to napkins; to Elaine) Could I get napkin over there?
What do you expect? It's airline food.
No don't do this. You're not doing this. I will fight you. No you don't... No.
Yeah, I know that!
No, it&Mac226;s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i...
Will you let me pay just once.
Well at breakfast everybody reads.
I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
All right. (sits down)
No I haven't?
Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!
Who's stopping you?
What's going on in there?
No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.
You're really going to town with that turkey there.
You really should.
is that so?
Alright.
Are you through?
C'mon Elaine, it's just a goiter...
(Obviously resents talking to her) Yes.
40.
You're never gonna make it!
After two dates!
But you like your Joel Rifkin.
There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.
(dry) I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw? (really disappointed) Let's get out of here George.
No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.
It's ludicrous..
And I don't want you to hold mine!
Tropic of Cancer.
Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?
Why were dogs chasing you?
Well, she is a woman.
(under his breath) Oh no.
Bedroom.
He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?
(not as eager) Hi Joan.
Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.
(Confused) I don't know what that means.
Well, you're your own boss now.
I think he's gonna need, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
They deliver the coal?
Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number.
Hmmmm...
Something to drink?
Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He couldn't! (listens) Alright, I will. (listens) Okay, bye.
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??... Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women!
Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something.
Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.
What?
'The ocean called, They're running outta shrimp'?
Hey...I'm not stupid. I'm looking in that drawer, there's no can opener.
Come on up. (to parents) It's George.
I don't like this Kramer. Will it be much longer?
I don't think so...
Thirty-six. What's the signal? Howbout this? Chicken wing? No, no, no, I got a better one. Head patting.
No.
Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.
Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?
So listen...
Come on let's eat something. (phone rings)
Wow.
Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...yknow, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, its dark, theres bubbles happening, theyre all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, Cmon babe, lets go. You come by, you open up the lid and theyll- (stiffens up, as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, theyre in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, Tomorrow, the dryer, Im goin. You wait here! The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you dont see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So theyre showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isnt your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first.
Tub is love.
Come on.
Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.
It's Jerry.
There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.
What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time
Yeah.
Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.
I gotta talk to her. What do you think?
We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
Friend!
There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.
We'll be funny.
Yeah, sure we will.
I didn't know any of this.
I thought you'd like that.
Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.
Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.
Yeah, but with you it's intentional.
But you made it through the day before.
Okay.
This old thing?
In case of what?
Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.
Well, Guatamala...
Oh Come on!!
George Costanza...
...So how's Noreen?
All right. Put 'em on top.
She happy for you?
Nobody needs to talk.
Good. (pause) Steak knife?
Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.
All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.
What do you want?
(Reading it) "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." - What is that?
What?
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
Whats to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.
Oh yeah.
Next Wednesday.
If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, Im telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. Im sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.
So how did you leave it with him?
Oh, wow.
Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the lunch with me?
(to the man) Excuse me. Mister Benes?
Come on. How was your date?
Yeah, I liked him.
So then we went to dinner.
Oh, you dont recall?
I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?
Yes, so people are just dialing it by mistake and getting you.
Hey, is Davola outside?
Yeah.
You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't remember anything about you.
So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist. You just called the woman for a date.
You didn't get my papers?
Already? That was fast... I assume he's not a High Talker...
You're the man!
Hmm, So?
What idea?
Sounds familiar.
(Disappointed) Oh. Is George there?
Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.
Yeah, uh, Ok, uh, tomorrow uh, where da ya - where do you live, uh, up town? Upper west side?
We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.
Yes, well that was nothing.
Can you believe that?
(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. (Joel shakes his head agreeing; Jerry smiles) You know, its their annual terrorist luncheon.
Look I don't know.
I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy could write checks to himself right out of my account.
That puddle! (Kramer sees the puddle and does a double-take.)
What he gave it to me.
Pretty good. I think she might be the one.
Id rather not say it out loud. Its embarrassing.
(sings theme) "By Mennen."  What the?...
I dont bother with him. Hes been calling me for seven years. Ive never called him once! Hes got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if hes paying attention.
Hi Roy.
You know, Schumann went mad from that.
That was Keith.
Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.
Problem in the bedroom?
Oh yeah, shes great.
I can't believe your a friend of mine.
Okay. I mean, what if the--
Let go, Elaine!
Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!
Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on.
I think you'll get it out.
Oh Diane.
(pointing at TV) Hey, that's her!
(to Kramer) who is it?
You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.
Here, check that out.
Fantastic.
Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.
What?
You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this jockey and the jockey got off the horse and started chasin' him.
What do you need a hammer for?
No, I don't know if I'm invited.
Hey, do you know what the Whip does?
Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?
(pause) I don't know, they just tell you the night before.
Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.
You dont have to say Wow. I know its Wow. (Kramer smiling) And theres that smile again. Well, what is that? (Intercom buzzes.) Its George.
Where did you meet this guy?
Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit) And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.
Hey.
I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.
You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.
So I guess , you're not getting married?
Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.
Yeah. are you full?
Its great! It speeds up the intimacy level. Its like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish (snaps his fingers) three days.
Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) "Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."
...what?
(wiping his brow) He could use a couple laughs.
What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
No, I told you, it's just a dry run.
Just clarifying.
It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.
(doubtful) You were in the Army?
Ah.
George.
No, you didn't.
Half of show business is here.
Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'
..What is this?
So write a letter.. move to another...move to Staten Island., 'lot easier to blend in a sea of people in Staten Island than China believe me.
Hi! How 'r u doing?
No, Katie, don't-- (He hangs up phone)
No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.
What is it?
I dont know.
Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.
Excuse me?!
I'm sorry.
Fix a screen door in Queens.
I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.
No.
I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.
Oh, please.
I forgot.
Hello is this Alicia? .This is Jerry Seinfeld.
Hi. Elaine, it's me.
Good. How did you handle that?
Cookies?
That's enough. (They leave. George comes around the corner.)
A bigger bill?
I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment for two days. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my parents. they'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own I'm sure it's gonna be some awful dump. Wait a second.. Have you checked in The Plaza yet?
I dont care. Im sleeping next door.
Alright, he just left. We can go.
Eh, show biz...
I didnt even know the woman.
No.
Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'
Sue Ellen Mishke?
No spiel?
Well I guess if I?m the Miana I should go. All right, all right.
Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.
And . .
You don't drink.
Kramer you don't under the conversion rate.
Hey.
You picked up on a vibe, from a nun.
(Pleading) George, I'm sorry.
Yeah.
No, I can't feel anything.
Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that canvas?
So you're never gonna have sex again?
So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?
No.
"Big head" (Scoffs) That's almost a compliment.
Oh relax, Katie. It's not a problem.
What happened, did you pass the stone?
Yeah, yeah I did.
Oh, yes you will.
Really good.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell.
oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this.
And you don't...
That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?
I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.
So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?
Why not?
George- What?! Youre kidding... Well, whats wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, Ill speak to you later. (He hangs up.) Wilkinson, the guy whos supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, hes in the hospital.
I didn't know you had a motorctcle.
What the hell is going on here?
But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.
George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman!
Maybe you're a little jealous.
Well, break a leg.
Uh huh. When youre on a stakeout, do you find its better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?
Oh, I'm paying for breakfast?
(barring the way) I'm sorry. I-I don't know you.
What giant freak-head?
They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.
You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.
You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't destroy someone else's.
I don't know him. I know who he is.
Wow, the whole building burned down.
What's the difference? You never showed up.
I've hardly been out to dinner with them.
Yeah.
George!
Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! (Kramer gestures sympathetically) And who buries a bird?
Yeah...
He did it.
So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.
Walk away?
Who?
Oh. No. What, you mean because of the "Chang"?
So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?
Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up.
Well what happened?
Defence? Please. ...They need speed.
Can we just go in already?
The bad fianc&Mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...
(taking back the check) Oh yeah.
Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.
I know. Im really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.
Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?
Dont worry about it, it wasnt working anyway.
(doing the voice) La la la.
Another one?
Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)
You have a girlfriend?
I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel.
No I can't she didn't leave her name or number.
I thought you were leaning towards Julie.
Tonight?
What else did you say to her?
I dont know, I don't feel so good.
All right take it easy, just take it easy.
Yeah, yeah. Dont worry about it.
Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.
She might be. She's the star of the show.
129 West 81st street.
There's more than a couple.
You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?
She's okay.
Not at all.
What?
You look like something's on your mind.
Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.
Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's got this strangest habit. She eats her peas one at a time. You've never seen anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. I mean, we've had dinner other times. I've seen her eat Corn Niblets. But she scooped them.
Good morning.
I don't wanna be a 32.
What, What is this? What is she doing here?
And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.
What if I didn't do it right?
Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.
I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!
oh! thank you.
On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!
What if I don't want it?
Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.
Fleckman?
No I haven't.
No body said youre fat. Hes a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy.
All right, all right. Whats the big hubbub, bub?
Yeah?
Yes, clothes. This is normal.
Well, what about my car?
If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like Lex Luthor.
Stop smelling your arm.
What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?
What do you need a job, you got Audrey.
What's the matter?
The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.
Ugh, the four worst words in the English language.
A present.
Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.
No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?
Sure. See, things always even out for me.
Boy... I dont know.
What'd you say?
George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality.
You don't seem too bothered by it.
Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.
Ohh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands. So.. (Goes for his coat)
What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. "I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other people. You won't be around me. But you will be around." "Take care now." Did you ever say that to somebody? "Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now." "Take care. Take care." What does this mean? "Take off!" Isn't that what you really want to say? "Take off now."
(to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?
Who's got a tissues? I need more tissues! Look at this thing. It's my phone finger!
She thinks youre a guy that doesnt like coffee.
Hey I don't even want the pen now!
I can't believe this.
Bless you.
He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes.
Oh, she didn't mind?
For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.
Why? It's our place.
Still got it.
Not goin' to the Knick game.
Alright.
Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)
Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)
A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision.
Coughing... naked... It's a turn-off, man.
They got away.
Naturally.
George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.
Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?
Yeah. Let's go.
Did you shower today?
Yours?....You know what I'll think I'll brush later.
I tried to do that.
Are you sure?
You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What is it?
Everything?
But you could?
(startled - eyes wide open) Hello, is somebody there? (scurrying sound) Mr.- Mr. Marbles?
You're complaining about a private jet?
Pam? What do you care? (Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying a Brentano's bookstore bag.)
Maybe youre right.
No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.
Well, she obviously liked you all along.
Why what did I do?
Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you (throws the bottle to Kramer.)
I know that, Kramer.
Me?
Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So...
I'll just call her when you leave!
Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?
Just forget it. Let it go.
Cant get it.
So, Im gettin the insiders deal?
Yeah, that's right.
What is wrong?!
Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?
(pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?
That wasnt so bad, really.
what?
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.
uh uh, we're uh ..
You saw her? What was she wearing?
Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and put it in.
"...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!"
Here. Take a look. What, what is that?
I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.
Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay.
(a little confused) You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables?
I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.
(indistinct) Got all this?
So what your genitals are still lined up.
Hi, is Sandy here?
Right.
Its a list of excuses, its for that guy, Horneck, whos at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I dont have to see him. (Elaine laughs.) I need it. (Elaine starts writing on the list.) What are you doing?
What? Don't say that!
Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred!
I'm gonna grab a can of balls.
So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.
(opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?
It's been known to happen....... telling you right now Elaine, this guy 's gonna dangle that dress in front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule.
Is it padded?
You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!
You could get arrested.
No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman.
A bowl, ok?
Oh, come on.
I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.
It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...
(to himself) Hoh, that Milos. (to Patty) Well uh, what shall we do, uhm, care for a cup of coffee?
Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.
(Picks one up) Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?
(thinking) Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?
(To Kramer) All right, were goin in.
That's the *least* of what you've accomplished...
Can you get vomit out of suede?
Got 'em on the street, from a scal... (catches himself again)
He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. (Mimics brushing his teeth) Away from the gums... (The door opens a little, George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and Elaine, then enters.)
I've always wanted to do that...
Yeah. Im having a wonderful time. (it's obvious he isn't)
"Not necessarily because....."
Newman.
Back and to the left Back and to the left
So just start it.
Hey. What's with your neck?
That is so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood horse?
Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.
Oh, I'm delighted.
Sorry. Hang on.
No.
c'mon ,c'mon....
Ah...the volume.
Turn around, George.
Yeah, well, it's honest.
Leo?
(Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key?
Yeah.
Here, what is that?!!
No, no, I...
(In awe. Whispering) The botched it?
What about me?
Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!
Because you're a woman!
Irked?
She couldn't make it.
What did you do?
See, now that I don't care for.
Either that, or theyve got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why dont you just go to the cashier?
Do I really have to explain why?
No, I hadn't noticed.
It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.
Well, it's a spider.
He's not doing anything. Goodbye!
Really?
What are you talkin' about?
Maybe you should date the mothers.
The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. "Who was that clown?", "I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?", "The guy's a clown!". How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, "What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!"
Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.
Me?
Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?
Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.
Up state! Hummm.
Hey, Tim.
Hey buddy. I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's like in there, all night long things are creaking and cracking. And that red light is burning my brain!
No. We both just saw the same monkey.
(to Kramer) Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot.
Well, Gail Cunningham.
That's right. I bought it.
I don't know, it's ten dollars.
What you got, a pair of bullets?
Can't be done, huh?
Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.
What?
(Sarcastic) Thanks for the tip.
Yeah.
Obviously never.
Gee thanks! Thanks a lot!
All right. (picks up the alarm clock) Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 650... volume check. (music playing, he starts swinging) What kinda music you wanna wake up to? Top 40, classical...
Yeah. Why?
No I wasn't there. (enters and slams the door)
Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?
cool guy? what are you, in 8th grade?
My Nana?
Why?
Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.
The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what youre doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? We have soda, we have soda, we have soda, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. Its a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and youre watching TV and youre drinking the exact same product that theyre advertising right there on TV, and its like, you know, theyre spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and Im standing there, Maybe Im putting too much ice in mine.
No.
I'm sorry, I..
Kramer dating your room mate. It's funny.
Oh, I cant believe it. Let me see that. (Jerry takes the paper.) Thats four and a half points in three days! Thats almost half my money!
Why not?
(looks round) Don't worry, I'll get you out.
Looters.
Oh... You mean... shrinkage.
What?
Obviously.
So is she working? Is she here?
But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.
A wallet? Let me see that.
Kramer, look, it's George.
Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.
Oh yeah? Huh.
Tough one. You're call.
And who is on the show? Who are the characters?
No, I dont eat dinner. Dinners for suckers.
Kramer, it is not what you think.
What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty minutes of 'So, who's from out of town?'
I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.
Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.
Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why dont we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. (All three sit down) Now, look, you both find each other attractive, right?
Whats that one?
I cant. Im on my way out. Theres no way I can do it.
Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? Im sorry. I didnt mean it. I took it out on you. Were still friends. Were still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, Ill tell you what. Ive got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.
Kramer!
How are we gonna get out of it?
Yes, the hole!
He couldn't believe it.
How do you know she's not my wife?
(deadpan) That must be some book.
He feels he's funnier, more relaxed.
Yes. (kisses Nana) Yes of course.
Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you.
I don't think so.
Wait a second. .Just give me a second
Aren't you going to take the check down?
I thought your mother's paying for it.
Have you said anything to her?
George was right. Didn't take you long.
You're not late.
Um, you know, its the damnedest thing. It went away.
Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.
Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later.
Just get the key and let's get out of here.
I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?
Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?
Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.
Please, don't make me beg.
(quiet annoyance) I don't write skits.
All right! Lunch!
Intervention.
hi Elaine
So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.
I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.
Hey.
You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?
It's true.
(flips a roll of paper towels in the air) Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.
I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work.
Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser.
Why?
Well why don't you say it?
Wait a minute, that's my ticket! You didn't even want to go.
Yeah, it's me. Kramer found the car!
Filthy pigs.
Aaaaahhh...!!!
Ok...
Hi.
Hi.
To see a movie.
Coincidence? This guys in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment?
(to Kramer and Morty) What is this about?
yeah. I think I do.
Uh-huh.
Oh, heh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.
Bania.
I don't know how I feel about it.
What?
I don't want to.
Can I get anybody anything?
Lopper.
She didn't even want a napkin.
I dont even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, Ive met them three times in my life.
No, its not that. It wasnt all one-sided.
Nah, I don't wanna go.
Oh really? (tries turning away in the hopes Elaine gets the hint; thinking) Oh God, I gotta get out of this.
Hi.
That's my ticket!
Listen, Joel, I dont think we should see each other anymore.
She must be psychotic or something.
That's right.
I dont think so. You know they, theyre so fragile.
(long pause).......Sure. ( humms a song then stares at the toothbrush)
I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.
My car!
Great job.
Don't ask.
Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.
(quietly) Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?
Not since June 29, 1980.
Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time.
Anywhere in the city?
Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.
Oh, come on!
No.
Thanks.
What?
No, what'd you say?
Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?
Yeah, so how's my money?
I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.
Hey.
And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?
It's not going to happen.
I think SHE saw it coming.
Oh, yeah, you mentioned her.
Really?
Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)
That's right, lady!
Why dont they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, Just Back. All back; No front. You walk in the front, youre immediately in the back. (Jerry picks up a tie display, and shakes it rhythmically from left to right.) Look, Elaine, tie carwash.
Yeah all right.
Oh, my god!
My mother's.
It's unheard of ...
Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.
No, No, No, No, Oh, No.
Where did you get that?
(realizing something) Oh, my god!
Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?
Oh, it's not that bad!
Oh it's a fascinating field!
Are you all right?
Sure.
Yeah.
Is this my stereo?
Oh uh, Kramer, this is Donna.
Really...
Hi!
With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.
Hello?
Wow. Kenny Rogers Roasters. Finally open. Hey, look at the size of that neon chicken on the roof.
Thanks.
So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George?
(to Kramer) Hey.
And you didnt even hear how she sounded.
Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.
What am I drinking, milk?
What is it?
(downcast) Oh, I'm sorry.
(emphatic) I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!
He knows what he's doing.
What do you think it could've been just some dude?
...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code.
To Latvian Orthodox?
(Only turning back for a second) Hey.
Boy, they seem pretty angry about something.
Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.
So why don't you get a locksmith?
Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.
You look like a tourist.
Yes?
No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
What?
Kinda cool lookin'..
(Puts his hand over his mouth) What?
Yeah, I washed it.
Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason.
Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender! (an event guard stops them)
(still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.
I think he's black.
Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?
You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.
Well Im glad it's working out.
Yea.
I don't even think you could do it.
Echh
What show?
(opens the door for George) Where did you get that?
The *beach*?
Kramer, should I call Susan?
Looks like a swan.
Hey! Greg
Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.
No, No bomb.
I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So(throws away belt) thats it!
(Skeptical) Ohhh yeah.. right.
Who?
No. What happened to you?
Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal.
Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!
What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.
Oh hi Enzo.
Kramer.
Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah.... well Elaine.
Maybe I will.
"Cut to the chase"?
Not bad!
*We*? No.
Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years.
O.K., soon as Elaine gets here.
(Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do?
Hey. How's the new place?!
Elaine!
Ohh, you got the jacket back.
Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!
I'm sorry, Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen)
Sue Ellen Mishke?
Fine.
[to taxi driver] Take the Park!
The fabric of society is very complex George.
That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.
Dirt? That's alright, (for Jenna's benefit) because there's nothing wrong with dirt.
Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?
Tropic of Capricorn?
No, but wait, wait And then you dump them off onto Kramer..
Listen to this "I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."
But I went to the funeral.
C'mon up.
I don't believe it.
Allow me. What are you, an idiot?
I think you're wrong.
Forget the bench.
So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?
It is kind of silly.
Im worried I wont be able to talk to him. Hes such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.
(defensive) At least it was just the handle!
(Confirming) An alliance. (They both shake hands and laugh evily) Now get the hell outta here. (Newman leaves)
Well its not like it's a really funny story or anything.
Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you.
Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.
Commando 8?
Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. "I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa " Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... (Naomi exits) it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality.
Oh, no.
This is amazing.
All right.
Alright, I'll talk to you later.
Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? Theres Elastic Man... Plastic Man...
Wa, it's two weeks old.
Yup.
No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?
You're giving up that easy?
So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the Spokes model category?
I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!
Is that the end of it?
No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.
No, It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago . she's trying to become an actress.
Never.
Yeah, college was fun.
No, of course not, of course not!
Alright!
Well, what is it?
Really? What would you do?
I think I got someone!
Thanks.
And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.
Yeah. Me.
No.
Toilet brush, oh (he pulls a 'Damn, shoulda guessed!' face). Alright, I can replace that.
There he is. He's going into that bar.
Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant?
Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
Danish. Is it from Denmark?
oh I though you didn't care about his looks
Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!
No.
have some more, take some for the road.
I don't really have enough room.
Yeah, too bad.
He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal.
No, he was on his regular bed.
(Stopping the notion) What's that?
I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
Done.
But I might.
You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift.
Maybe this isn't my coat.
Yeah.
Hello Newman.
No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off.
(Modest) Oh, you know, the usual..
Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?
Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.
Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.
(looking behind the counter) Hey, is that Babu? It is! (walking over) Hey, Babu!
Who?
Columbus, Euro trash.
Yeah, but it never works.
No.
You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back.
You and me.
Is that a thick marble?
I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
Come on.
Mmm, succulent.
Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys.
So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy.
What?! Wha... what'd you put in there?
I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.
Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?
Isn't he, Elaine?
George used up all my guest passes already.
Hey, cable guy's looking for you.
Hey.
Yeah.
(Nodding) Okay, one-fifty.
What is that?
What?
It was a so-so sorry.
Well Cindy, the place looks great.
What was that pop sound?
I don't know, but you better keep it up.
I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.
Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.
There's Sidra.
That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.
She saved your life?
I'm going to the hospital to see Fulton. I'm not even saying hello, I'm going right into material.
You haven't even seen it.
Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine.
..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beveridged!
No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.
Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you?
Cheque. Now, the fact is, if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, yknow, cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they dont know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster (Jerry draws imaginary book from a holster.) Who do I make it out to? Theres my ID. Theres something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I dont know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, I dont have any money, but if youll contact these people, Im sure theyll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I dont have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?
No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.
What made him get that thing?
(Screams) GET OUT!
I can't give details.
(Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.
Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected, outwardly.
Im going out. (he comes out of the dressing room, while Kramer remains inside)
No thanks, maybe some other time.
Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.
Nah.
(upset) Ohhhh, what are you doing? Kessler, its a tape! I taped the game, its one oclock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.
So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister...
(standing in the bathtub) Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.
Ohh.. look at this..
You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?
I'm Seinfeld!
Where's the Mohel?
Mammal.
Why aren't you there now?
Can you move over at all?!
Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.
Ahh, I'm, I'm kinda soured.
Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!
Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!
Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?
You just can't leave him out there.
I did not. You guys gonna go through some red lights?
Why didn't you ever mention this?
Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.
Bug guy.
Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?
Evry-Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. "Oh, is he good?" "Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best." They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, "You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. No, he's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher." And then there's always that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me." Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, "Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. And everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."
You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?
I don't believe this. (They run into theater)
Nah, it's not for me.
I think if ones going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. Its common courtesy. I dont know. Thats just the way I was brought up.
Miffed.
But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.
So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?
Hey, it's okay.
No I don't.
Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.)
Oh, I'm sure it's fine.
Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)
You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.
Look at you, you got the job.
U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you?
"Rust-proofing"?
Sure.
That's why I poked.
Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss.
I believe we're not...
The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.
You can tell me, I'll vault it.
Oh, come on, be a come-with guy.
So, when do I get my dinner?
It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library
(Pleading) I'm really sorry.
The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal.
Don't say that.
She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.
Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.
You put her on a pedestal.
Hi, Mr. Abbott.
No.
Yeah, the guy with the flat head.
What?
Wait. How does Horneck know you?
so the woman was walking around in a bra
Im no cat killer.
Sure.
Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!
You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?
Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read. I was wondering if-
No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him.
No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.
Absolutely.
Let's go.
Hey, could you do me a favour? [pause] Could you shut-up?
Damn, I was too overanxious, he must have noticed that.
(Nodding) I think you may have something there.
No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.
They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing."
Yeah.
Ahem. Say that again?
That's what I was thinking.
Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Yea nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?
Ah! boy.
You're breaking up?
What do you say to a person like you?
Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.
Oh, get out of here.
What?
Let's put him over here.
I have fleas.
What are you all out of breath from?
Where you goin'?
(Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.
Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
All right, so uh, let's do something later. How 'bout a movie?
All of a sudden you get hungry?
First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.
(Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!
Great? Where do you get great?
...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to.
Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.
I mean all that stuff is so small.. ((ELAINE is wryly assessing him)) stupid..
Hey, hey.
Heh.
I don't even know what to say.
Elaine, see this T-shirt, six years I've had this T-shirt. It's my best one, I call him Golden Boy.
AM/PM.
She's very assimilated.
Wait, that's you?
No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?
Excuse me?
Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.
So when do I meet this jerk?
Yeah.
Hmm.
Hey look, there's a spot right in front.
Fasten your seat belts. we're goin' to see the baby.
You don't think she's attractive?
Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.
Well, I don't normally--
It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ...
(smiling) Really? That's great. You said that to him?
You're saying I'm responsible for the couch?
Sure.
Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?
What?
No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.
Nina?
This is no good. This is no good. Call her house.
Mmmmmmmm!
Wow! What'd she say?
He went back? What do you mean he went back?
.. and uh, underwear and a tee shirt.
I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.
So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. Whats the matter?
Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is who's responsible for this?
Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!
They're looking.
What?
Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?
Stuff.
No, I don't want that smell in the house.
Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over my side.
(doubtful) There's crepe money?
Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.
But we're in towels.
I know, I know.
Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test.
Yeah.
No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial.
Really?
No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?
A little less beady today.
Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?
Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that?
Did you hear what I said?
Oh, the guy from Jersey?
Neither have I.
That is the guy!
Wizards!
Yeah, all right. All right.
How did he find out?
I'm I'm a comedian.
(Shrugs) I - I don't get it.
He's joking.
What's around you?
You met J. Peterman?
He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.
Yeah.
Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.
It's not like you're my wife.
Yeah.
What?
Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits on a couch.) Hey, what about this one?
Youre flesh and blood.
Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!
She's makin' the three o'clock train.
Sure.
It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.
Kramer!
Oh, you're crazy.
What?
Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!
Can I use your phone?
Come on up.
Kramer?
(surprise) This is your son?
Who?
It stinks.
We split it.
What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.
Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble...
Theres more. The refrigerator.
What? What did you--
Leo?
Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*!
That's what's so fascinating.
She's Gooone.
Get out of here.
So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner?
Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry won't let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesnt that bother you?
Will you stop it already?!
It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.
Widower? Wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research)
(to Kramer) To the right.
So what good are you?
Who is it?
Hotel?
Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.
(pulling Leo back in) Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you.
Please-
Shes gotta be here soon.
Wow! So...?
A Mister Kenneth Bania.
It's Sunday.
Happy, Pappy? What does that mean?
Oh, its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.
(giving him a steak from the fridge) Here ya go.
You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me.
"Slow it down"?
(Casually, sarcastic) Either way.
Doesnt think anyone can tell. So cmon, do we have a deal?
Well, what's wrong with you?
Well what do girls do ?
No, you'd have to be crazy.
What!?
What is this?
Oh my god, he knows. (Jerry and Gino scrambling) Go. (yelling to the door) One second.
Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job.
Why?
Jim Fowler? The animal guy from "Wild Kingdom" is coming to your apartment?
Hey. George off to Detroit?
Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it.
I'm gonna find out tonight.
It's not like she's *in* the movie.
Elaine...
All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm away, gets phone) now... the failsafe. The wake-up guy... (dials)
What do you got there?
Why not?
Marisa Tomei?
alright that's enough
Ah, will you stop it already?
Bender.
Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet?
They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?
Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere... I got my bags, I'm ready to go.
Hiya, Jack.
"Salami salami bologna"?
But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
Her tip.
I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.
Friday night.
George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.
Hi.
Youre already moping! Would you take the place?
(re-entering) Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again, are you?
Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll never get another date with her. She'll freak out.
Oh so you still don't believe us.
(agreeing) well three years is a long time to be married.
What's wrong with lunch?
I'm serious about it.
Are you gonna say it again?
"No no you said George likes spicy chicken."
All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you.
Turn in?
Ive been thinking about asking this girl Im, uh, seeing-
He say anything?
That's your move?
Looks like there is?
No.
So you started drinking.
Family?
Ah, just, you know, I don't know. Stuff, I gotta do. (grabs coat and throws it over his shoulder)
Sure. (points at booth) How about this one?
I met her on an elevator.
I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how theyre going to look at a thing like this.
(Agreeing) What's more important?
Oh, I know you are.
I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.
You did it? What happened?
No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking.
Oh, I can take it.
"Aw right."
I'm telling you.
George?
Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.
Marine biology.
So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?
Oh screw him! (George enters)
I really think the M&M should be you.
I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)
What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him? 'Cos I asked him about the Knicks?
Oh, the beach.
So what?
Oh, I'd love to, are you sure?
Yeah.
Good. Whats the matter?
Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.
Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time.
(talking to Beth on the phone) Could you put him on, I'd love to say hello.
(simultaneous) Hey!/That's wonderful!/We got a deal!
It means he's lying.
Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.
Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?
I was merely speaking extemporaneously.
What should I do, should I call the police?
What?
You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do.
No move. So, you see, its all part of a divine plan.
(To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.
Face to face.
Ah, where you gonna meet a mute?
(negative) Eehh.
Yeah.
I'm glad we had this talk.
. . . HE ended it?
Hey, Elaine.
So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right?
Yeah.
Few do.
Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.
Oh
Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. (Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks at Kramer.)
It was life and death.
They eat fish.
Where?
Hey Elaine.
What happened to you?
Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game.
I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.
(taking the menus) Oh, thanks.
He wants to talk about "Jerry"!
Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe well get together.
Just put a coffee table book over it.
Yeah.
I'm buying you a new sofa.
I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.
Yeah.
(thinking) Great. Thanks.
You won't even taste it?
How could I have done that?
Hey.
Yeah! I got it . It's in the apartment, but we can't go in there it's being fumigated.
I think we've worked out a system.
You have a girlfriend?
(handing his dad a gift) Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.
Get me some duty free Kahlua.
My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didnt want to move to Florida, but theyre in their sixties, and thats the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old peoples house with a golf cart, jump out, Lets go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. Drop it! I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversations so boring. Its so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, What if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass. You know. Come back in, theres broken glass, everybodys all upset. No, Im all right. I was just a little bored there. And uh no, Im fine. I came back. I wanted to hear a little more about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Lets pick it up right there.
I'm gonna call the cops. That?s what I?m doing, I?m calling the cops.
We can only thank God for that.
Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?
Golden Boys always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry. Here... touch Golden Boy!
What, theres something wrong with Loni Anderson? (pause) Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it.
Well my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.
My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.
Hey, that's great.
She's got a fine cheek.
I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
I got a 31 waist, mister!
He's gonna talk into her other ear.
I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? "Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!"
So uh, what do you think?
What the hell is that?
So call now.
What kind of company is it?
She's fifty.
(Still pulling) Squinch em!
Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.
Oh! my God!....
Right.
What?
I think Ive played there.
I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes when someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within the gay community. They're probably discriminated against because of that, people say to them "Y'know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but I think think it's about time, y'know that you got in shape, tucked the shirt in and lost the wife". But if people are even going to assume that people that are neat are gay, maybe instead of doin' this, "Y'know I think Joe might be a little... [waves hand back and forth]", they should vacuum "Y'know I think Joe might be >vroom< [makes vacuuming motion]. Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little >vrooom<..."
And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.
Latex? And what do I do with latex?
Lloyd?
Right.
She got the promotion?
Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight!
That's Step Ten?
All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.
Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I cant ask her.
That'd be great. There's no wrong answer.
So, what ever happened with that?
Whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guyll be like, I dont think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life? And of course the womans looking at the guy, thinking, What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?
What are you doing?
How do you know?
Who do I know who would have even been in a limousine yesterday anyway. Uhh-O h-owow!
(Remembering) Oh, right. The big party..
(Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.
Elaine! No! No!
Wouldn't tune in.
Yeah, right.
I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around..
Poppy seeds!
You've had the apple pie?
Huh?
You don't know?
(bossy) What are you doing?
How did you know about that?
Fluff and Fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.
oh with huh.. pretty boy.. Tony
everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah?
Oh, like you know what you're talking about!
Dad!
Yes I am.
You wanna barrow Golden Boy!
That smells good, what is that?
Just put it.
So, what did she do?
That's enough.
She doesnt wanna borrow the money.
Wait'll you get to know him.
What did you really get?
Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches)
I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping.
You could be Colin.
Hey.
No, not yet.
Ready for lunch?
Yeah. Pretend like it never happened.
Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio.
Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 630 and gimme a call.
Yeah.
(pause) All right; let's move it out.
More Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I don't even have any wood in the house!
(OC) Hey everybody! Who's ready to laugh?
No.
Hey, wait a second. You know, we could share a cab. They're playing at the same Cineplex.
Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.
(thinking) Uh-oh... What do we have here?
You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy.
All right. But then I can't tell you the BIG news.
(joyless) Yeah, yes.
You know I went out once with a nude model. Never let me see her naked. Hundreds of people see her naked every week, except me. Needless to say it was quite vexing.
Everybody's got them.
Look! I don't want 'em!
Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.
Uh, just my next door neighbor.
Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.
Yeah, I know how you feel.
We're pathetic you know that?
What is it she think you can't do?
Oh, you dig?
No, Elaines got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and hes suppose to do it.
Alright.
China really?
It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.
Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?
So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial?
I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.
There isn't?
Oh, come on. Thats not true.
Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)
Soo...
Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, "Make sure you hang on to your jacket."
Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?
Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How many of those did we go to?
(picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt off?
Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--
It's Jerry.
Yes you do.
Not bad.
What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?
Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?
A robot butcher?
You had how many dates with him? Three?
Ooow, that was close.
I wouldn't know where to start.
That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?
Too good.
Wow!
My god, are you okay?
(reluctant) Nah, nah. I'd rather...
I can't do this.
Could you make a little more noise? (To his parents) Listen, I'm gonna have to call you later.
George Peppard has been dead for years.
Hi.
Alright.
Someone says, Get out of my life, and that doesnt affect your appetite?
Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that "Miss Congeniality" on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going? (Kramer enters.) Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey, what are you doing tonight?
(dry) He knows.
Yeah?
Oh, help me, Rhonda.
There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of... (he cracks) Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?!
Yeah, one sec.
The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off?
It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.
Today's not my birthday.
You'll chicken out at the last second.
It's like watching an animal get tortured.
It's like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action.
Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?
I didn't know she would laugh.
Where?
I have to go over to my grandmother's.
Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!
No! No pick!
That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this?
Come on. Lets go
Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?
How you doing?
I'll take fastidious.
Why don't you try your engagement story?
He's invulnerable to creditors.
Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!
(confused) Wha..? What time is it?
Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You cant do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.
Jane's topless. (They all look)
You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.
I couldn't
O-K. You realize of course, you're naked?
Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater)
You told Testikov, (Elaine nods) that Tolstoy wanted to name his book "War-- What Is IT Good For?"?
Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.
This is the man you have a crush on?
Uh, you don't have to take a picture.
Who?
Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.
Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it.
I don't know. Who could've been in my apartment.
Is that a fact?
And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
Well, Poppie's a little sloppy.
Right.
You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.
(still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)
Ah, dinner! Thats it, youre all the way back!
Right.
Wait, he stopped, he's parking.
Don't mention it to anybody.
Do you know what this is all about? Do you know, why were here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about We should go out? This is what theyre talking about...this whole thing, were all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, were all out! There are people tryin to find us, they dont know where we are. (on an imaginary phone) Did you ring?, I cant find him. Where did he go? He didnt tell me where he was going. He must have gone out. You wanna go out you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...Then youre standing around, whatta you do? You go We gotta be getting back. Once youre out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, its my feeling, youve gotta go.
Ah, hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you.
Let me get that.
What?
No, they won't call the police.
I know. I was just...
Like what?
No, don't cancel it.
Oh yeah. He's good. You know he's John Ritter's cousin.
Date with Karen?
Im a little nervous.
Hey.
I was listening!
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!
Okay, okay.
But that's your routine.
I gotta do some research here.
"I don't know how you can eat that spicy chicken,"
Uh, how about a couple of people like us.
I don't want to.
Oh, really. (Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.)
I-I-I don't like the opera. What are they singing for? Who sings? You got something to say, say it!
I'm not going to "defile" her!
Well, theyre three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.
Is it something I said?
Where?
Can I speak with this Bookman?
Nice try.
This is real believable.
Excuse me?
Huh?
(Interested, still looking at the couple) Really?
(Reading words George wrote on his hand) "Matthew, Luke, Paul", what youre cheating on your conversion chest?
It's green.
Yeah!
Id really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.
That's right. You're emotional.
Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you?
Coach to India - The only way to go.
I don't know. It must be love.
"Oh! How d'you like that?"
Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.
You don't want to go with me?
Jody the masseuse.
What thing?
I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg." But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, "Would you mind?!"
Shes limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.
I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race.
I know, but...
It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.
Be careful.
Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.
First of all, I made plans with Elaine.
Hello there you are.
You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
Yeah, that's possible.
Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, You think?
Hey, there's Elaine.
(Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?
All right, I'll see you later.
Where are you going, what?s the rush?
No. No you're not.
Owen March, I never heard of him.
I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different... sources.
(weary) Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out?
What?
What if you destroy him?
Nice to see you. This is Elaine.
(Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..
Yeah.
I don't know. That's like asking "Where's Waldo?"
Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, "Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. " "What are you watching?" "I don't care, I gotta keep going." "Who was that?" "I don't know what it was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going." Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, "Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel." You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, "Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of here. I'm going to bed."
Yeah, yeah, alright.
Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.
Wow, this is incredible!
Go ahead.
Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line.
Nothin'.....nothing at all.
(to George) Did you call me a wuss?
No, people hate that.
I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?
Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.
Great!
Oh. like they wouldn't have found that anyway.
Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.
I didnt open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.
What if it's Neil Diamond?
Coffee?
No, let's survey first. Camp here.
And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.
'I'm not here, leave a message.'
Nah!
Hi.
I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodations. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats.
Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there by two o'clock. We should take a cab.
Could you?
I think I'm in love.
Slim-fit?
That's incredible!
Alright, that's very good. Thank you.
Uh, Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld.
(outraged) He's a doctor!.I mean it's supposed to be like a sterile environment."
(Fishing for his keys in a kitchen drawer) You know, when I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time.
(pleased) I'll call George!
The exact same outfit.
Hi Ralph.
So I can see her tonight, and you dont care?
Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets.
....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant? Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it in there by helicopter, you know keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. "We got the hair but I think we lost the Zest." ....rejects the transplant with organs. Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . Guy just standin' there and suddenly... ..Bink! ( motions hair flying out of his head)........lands in someone's frozen yogurt.
(Also guessing) Crook eye?
Into the patient, *literally*!
You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.
Right you are.
Morning?
Why not?
Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...
Oh, nothing happened, you know, but is was great.
Yeah, that's a good tip!
So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry?
I didn't know he wasn't invited.
It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?
(Thinks) What does she say...?
(as Ping rambles on ) ...S'cuse me (Ping looks up) Kind of an expensive call.
Trust me, you're off.
What's with you?
What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display. (takes the peanut butter jar away from George)
Hello, Newman.
Euhh...Elaine....
These beans are pretty good.
(Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What?
That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this, okay...
Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, they'll believe us.
You know who speaks Korean?
I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.
She's good looking.
Was it apple?
He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.
Mmm.
Oh Moses smell the roses.
Oh, did you get that outta my bag?
Hot tub?
You are.
What if it gets in the side?
You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!
Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.
Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?
Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.
Well, your day's getting more interesting already. (Jerry shows the phone) Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.
Oh! I think we're at the bottom.
Hey.
They did it for three years. What's another few months.
Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.
If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!
Hello.
Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?
At your apartment?
What do you mean, oh boy?
The Portuguese waitress?
Hey, Frankie! So, where's the car?
Aw, looks just like you.
You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.
Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally!
What are you talking about?
Hello?
Don't worry Lois. I'll think of something.
Oh my god, you're kidding. (dives for his wallet) Hang on a second. (reading from his registration) It's JVN 728.
What's going on out there?
No no. I'm just saying.
You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world "I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable." (George is baffled)
You all right?
So......Susan's dead.....
It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!
But someone is waiting for me!
I try.
Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much for so long.
Okay, sixty bucks from Nana.
How could you go in there?
And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone.
No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.
Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.
You're good with the mothers.
Oh, sure...Truman Capote.
What?
What a family!
This is a, Bob Cobb.
Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?
(scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.
Ah, Tim Whatley. Out scalping?
And you want to be my latex salesman.
(firmly matter-of-fact) Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.
Uh, sometimes I use the sofa.
(thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And Ive still got another day! Ive got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. (to Vanessa) Thats a nice watch. Do you wind it?
Oh
Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in big, big trouble.
Named Suze?
And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
Who?
Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you.
Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.
I know look at this [shows ad]
What was that?
Yeah.
Oh, good.
Alright.
You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?
We're having the intervention for Richie.
STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this? Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.
What the hell?
Listen buddy,
What's wrong?
Well that was really fun, thanks.
Hello Newman.
I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
This friendship Its not working.
No.
...Yeah.
Wow, Newman's helmet.
The massages are out!
Well, I don't think that's gonna happen.
He said wuss?
I'm gonna get that. (walks across the set towards the blue curtain)
Go ahead.
I love crampbark.
I dont want cantaloupe now.
Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.
Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?
George, I didnt sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. Im just going to be honest. Thats all... Yes, Im nervous... Are you listening to me?... Just put some soap on your finger. Itll slide right off... Then try axle grease... (Kramer enters; to the phone) Ill call you back after I talk to her... Bye.
So, he's a writer.
Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt.
What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?
That's nice.
(answering) Hello?
Amy and Jeffrey?
So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye.
I like your nails, that is a great color.
No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter (pauses) Oh no!
(hurried) Great, bye.
But, you know, what if, you know?
(smiling) Yeah
You're behind in the count.
Yes!
Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?
Well, I'm great.
No! Dry-cleaned.
You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters.
I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
Are you sure?
Yea but...
. . . I can't.
Well, there's nothing left. There's no food.
Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm.
Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..
I got a date!
Maybe I'll check out France.
Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
There should be more people like us.
The woman, she--
Look...look at this can of tuna!
Elaine?
No, she's great! She's.. attractive, she's fun..
Yeah.
Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm alarge.
Now thats not fair! So where did you meet this guy?
And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.
Sounded good.
Yeah, we'll do it another time.
No no no. No dinner.
I hope so.
You weren't supposed to say that.
You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?
Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.
I dont know how this happened.
Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?
Why here?
Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?
We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.
Hey!
What's the matter?
Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker.
Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!
I'm sorry, uh,
(apologetic) Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.
Oh, man!
Well, y..you showed her who you are.
Maybe they've all been faking.
Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment. How 'bout I make it up to you with dinner?
Oh, hi Ellen.
Oh. that would be great.
Have we even been in public?
How is this an emergency?
(to himself) I have absolutely no idea.
Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.
What a surprise.
So you feel you were short changed.
What's with the signs?
Oh!.It's an affectionate caricature.
I thought it sounded kind of cool.
It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
Acting.
(Being frank) Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.
Oh Hi.
Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.)
Can I make it up to you? Ill give you fifty bucks for the jug.
I'm blown away.
My door?
Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.
Hello, uncle Leo!
But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.
You're on fire today.
(softly) Hmm.. they'll match my sneakers.
You know that awning outside my building?
Oh yeah.
What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.
I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.
How's it going?
Hi Evelyn.
How do you like that.
Look.
All right, do you want the quarter, take the quarter, but don't try and tell me it's yours.
Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.
Well don't get too comfortable. As soon as Seth gets a real job you two are gong back in that chicken supernova.
Why don't you see what you can do?
(to intercom) Yeah?
(going along with it) Oh No!
I'm sorry too.
Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.
I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?
George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!
Bad? (Elaine nods.) Very bad?
Ah, Lloyd.
C'mon, you want to have a baby.
What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead.
So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.
Hello Newman.
No.
So, where do you want to eat tonight?
Can you believe I did that?
(naked, carrying a belt sander) I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.
Not the gown again.
Oh, yeah. Right.
(shocked) Your husband?!
Hey, hey, what are you doing, that?s my quarter.
(To George) Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?
(doubtful) Yeah, you'll make it up to me.
Oh, in a minute, Carol.
Oh you are beautiful!
One Tim Whatley!
Why are you shouting?
some mouthwash, a hat, something.
Oh, right.
Flowing?
He was in the shop. I thought you told me he wasn't going to be there.
(still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.
That was a one in a million Mohel.
Oh thank you very much.
Oh, well.
She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. [sarcastically] I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... >click click< Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? >click click< I'm back...
Nothing.
Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?
No Elaine he's normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York.
(leaving; singing) She'll be coming around the mountain...
All right. All right.
Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it?
Music?
No, no of course not.
So, how hot did it get?
No I...
Well... theres a little bit of a problem.
Yeah thats a good deal -- you win the Pennant with that trade, hair for phlegm.
Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone to ghost read it.
Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.
Evelyn, this is Elaine.
So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you.
I don't blame you. I blame myself.
No.
Good!
I'M NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT!!
Is someone there?
All right, just give me a western. (unhappy)
What?
You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.
This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.
You didn't mind?
I'm sorry.
When you feel guilty.
"Ahh! You too with these?"
Hi.
Yum yum little tuna fishy?
You sure?
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?
Hello?
I don't know. I just feel he should call me.
Come on up. (Jerry presses the second button and opens the apartment door. He walks back to the couch.) Oh, all right, forget it, Im gonna take it with me now... (He picks up the cushions.) Im just gonna pack up the cushions right now...
I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.
Oh, you got something goin'.
I was ready to get jiggy with it.
You're turning.
Why doesn't she pay for hers?
Pulp couldn't make it across the table.
Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car.
(To himself) Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over there? It's not like somebody died. It's "Beaches" for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't.
Maybe I am.
I'll call back, thank you. (hangs up the phone) He went to South America!
Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.
You drew up plans for this?
C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one.
Oh, no. Its not that I dont think you can. I know that you cant, and Im positive that you wont.
You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it)
Yeah, but--
You still using that old alarm clock?
I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.
Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?
Fungicide. I mean what could she have?
Yeah well King Edward didnt live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.
So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk.
What is that song?
(interrupting) No no it's ok. (walking Rachel out) So we'll go see Schindler's List later right?
No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.
Who's there?
Yeah.. how about this I say "How's it goin'?"
Elaine, have you ever flown first class?
No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe it. I lost him. That stupid idiot. Now what are we going to do?
I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?
All right.
They have gotten to know you.
I like it tucked.
(thinking) Thank you, Pamela! (turns to talk to Vanessa; to Vanessa) So, youre a lawyer...
What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?
I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.
Well I think that's pretty obvious.
Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets.
Bye shmoopy.
We're not leaving the car!
(under his breath) Well, this worked out just as I had hoped.
But gymnastics is not for everybody.
(sarcastic) Yeah, you told me.
Oh, my God! [takes the phone] Ma?
Where's George now?
What?! How?
I think that's a 5-19.
I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.
Hello.
Where's that ticket? Oh, Kramer.
Jerry.
Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
Oh, yeah.
There's no precedent, baby!
Yeah.
What is it?
Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves)
Why?
Oh, hey. You got in.
Yeah.
Oh yeah. This can't miss.
I can't go if you're mad.
(pressing intercom) yeah?
You're right he's insane.
I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. (Lena is puzzled.)
Hello there, how're you doing?
Hi Cosmo.
When did you build this thing?
My grandfather gave me a statue!
How so?
(to the phone) Hello? (disappointed) Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) No. Uh, I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesnt know anything. Hes just my next-door neighbor. Uh, nothing much... Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. Im meeting somebody... Uh, Wednesday? Wednesdays okay... All right. Uh, Im a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning?... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone.
You unwittingly made a major commitment. That's a lot of pressure.
(Slow whispering) This is a nightmare.
NO! Kramer!
Ah, yeah.. I know.
That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.
Its a good mirror. (They look at their menus.) So, what are you gettin?
Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.
Hi
"Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!"
Why don't you get a new sofa?
Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.
(indicates with his thumb) Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.
That's not funny Naomi.
Yeah. (subdued) I don't think this is the jacket.
No, no, I mean...
(STARTS TO LEAVE, TO HIMSELF) ...Kramer
What, you're considering this?
The Bubble Boy? He lives around here?
Uh, you know, why dont you go first, you just had a long trip.
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?
No appointments at all? (motions to Elaine to move over)
I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
Disorder?
Sure.
(picks up the headphones) That was Elaine...
(What's goin' on,) like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--
No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.
Sample? (under his breath) Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book.
(Arms out, complaining) I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!
What, you rented "Home Alone"?
Oh, it's comin'. - Here ya' go.
Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
See what?
Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."
Hmm.
In his dreams.
If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.
We didnt bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.
Kramer!
Can't you just listen to me?
What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.
(to the Drake) Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. (To Elaine) Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?
I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?
The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.
Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless.
Ill have an egg white omelet.
Bye.
But I need the home bed advantage.
Nah, I dont go for these non-refundable deals. I cant commit to a woman. Im not going to commit to an airline.
Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.
If I see her, what do I say that Im doing here in the building?
You know, the Maestro.
``Rochelle Rochelle'', huh?
Yes.
No.
35, and George, on the invitations...
What do you think?
Lean your head back. Open your mouth! (Grabs Kramer's head) Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!
Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.
How can you lose?
So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?
What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do whatever it is you do. You disgust me.
Well, it couldnt be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?
huh huh
You live on this floor?
How much do they cost?
Wild pack of teenagers, huh?
It's funny.
(hangs up the phone) Yeah, I really needed that suit.
Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off that sign?
alright I changed my mind, uh yeah I don't think I'm not gonna go now
I cant believe I do.
(Scared) Ah! Kramer!
(Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here.
Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. You had to give him a box of cigars.
(nudging George) Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.
hey
No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.
What are you doing?
No its
So you just pretended it didnt bother you?
Even more reasonable.
How did you know?
You sure?
Just chatting. Friendly.
(standing) Alright, I'll see you later.
All right.
Boy, its a good thing we came.
No what?
aha
So, what are you doing this weekend?
Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.
Fine all done, just looking for the soap.
Hey.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!
I'm nuts about her.
Please.
No, of course not.
Hold on, they think you're handicapped?
You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?
Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.
Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way.
(to a woman) Hey, what's going on?
Yes, I'm impugning a continent.
Wow!
But you didn't really do any work.
The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper!
No. I'm not really looking.
Where you going?
Yeah?
Well, I'm sure you're not... Totally Depleted.
Well, thats good.
Yeah. Howd ya do that?
Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why dont you just settle it like mature adults?
So what does he care if you put lifts in?
Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log.
That was our babka.
This is amazing, you can't believe this!
We went over that.
That's what I thought.
On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?
He's a comedian.
(trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.
What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like it?
There's a lot of change down there.
So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you this thing was good!
Hey.
Yeah.
*Oh*, you mean you wanna *lose* it...
Ya.
What colour is it?
No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.
You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?
(seeing that Kramer has a new watch) What's that?
In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.
Well, what's wrong?
That has nothing to do with it.
John Houseman?
To spite my parents?
You faked with me?
So, what's on your mind?
Come in for two minutes and sit with me.
Oh, my god!
I don't think I am.
Well you might as well look it over.
I am a little freaked out!
Im Jerry, Elaines friend, and this is George.
So, Saturday night.
That is so Franco.
Elaine?
Right.
Ey, ey!
Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.
...he never heard of corduroy!
I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...
I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' (mimes throwing) 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?
You could do that?
That's not that?
What about?
(Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?
No. Things pop into your head. You?
Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.
Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway.
OUR LIVES!! . What kind of lives are these? We're like children. We're not men.
I don't know, some mints or TicTacs.
Hey look ,you know, you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here. You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(TO GEORGE) Hey George, you ever see one?
Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him.
Why don't you rent the movie?
(Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the 80s, and its still relatable today.
Kramer I don't think I can--
I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
Faster than a speeding bullet Lois.
Huh?
Yes.
Oh what, you're upset?
Yikes. Well, good look with all that.
Hi Sue Ellen.
Ohhhh...
Sure, its like robbing a bank. You dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.
So what do you have to say for yourself?
Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.
Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.
Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.
Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.
What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?
I really dont need to look.
Why are you doing this?
Uh...I got married.
I don't care.
Uma Therman? Really?
Reading for the Blind?
I don't know if he's mad.
Yeah, I think it is. (They walk toward the man. Jerry hesitates.) Wheres Elaine?
Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?!
The guy whos in the gulag?!
Oh my God.
You think we can do it?
Great. One of the best jobs I ever had.
This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!
Im sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
Oh. (unh - very quiet sigh)
I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous!
tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.
What happened to you?
What now?
No, I don't want to.
That?
Excuse me. (Gets up and answers the door.) Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!
Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?
Maybe I should ask her out?
Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?
What? It's a victimless crime.
Yeah.
See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. (Elaine laughs.) All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free.
(shaking his head no) No Kramer I don't want to talk to him.
I didn't do it!
Gee, I'm really sorry.
No. You?
What are you going to get her?
It's at the jeweler.
Oh boy.
Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because moneys a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you dont care about money when youre hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, youre like the ruler of an empire. More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives. Then after the meal, you know, youve got the pants open, youve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. Theyre mystified by the check. What is this? How could this be? They start passing it around the table, Does this look right to you? Were not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?
I dunno, maybe...
But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?
Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?
I agreed to wear this?!
Just me? No dudes or fellas?
Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.
Well, Clyde might not tell him.
Why did you force that mint on me? I told ya I didn't want the mint!
Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.
Well this is a great place to sit you got here.
The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too.
Because that's your thing!
(very disinterested) Hum... ok, what else you got?
Great talkin' to you. (Nina leaves. To himself) What the hell is e-mail?
Yeah. Highest paying job I ever had.
Hey. Could I use your shower?
This is horrible! I care!
Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?
That's him.
(in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room) Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad, you look so different.
No, I read in the paper..
No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.
Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.
So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo?
Have you tried the hamentashen?
Hey.
Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy.
So you just did the opposite of everything?
Hello. Didn't I see you at the pro shop yesterday?
(Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My, isn't this an awkward moment?
(knocking) Hey, Jenna. Hey!
Tough day at the office?
Oh No, wait a second... Wait a second... I-I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name.
Hey.
Hey.
What?
Hey! Kramer.
Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.
Have a good time.
No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.
You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.
Whats the rent?
What about your sea sickness?
Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.
I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.
That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?
Yeah, go ahead, take it.
C'mon I need it.
It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook?
How did it happen?
Remember Peter?
Yeah? Whered he go, to an arcade?
hey, uh.. (Kramer walks around a little) what'd you get there?
Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!
What date? It's a GUY.
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!
Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
Down here?
I know, I should've asked her.
I don't want it..
Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. (indicating) Come on in. You got the cigars?
Yeah, Uncle Leo.
(Still staring at the woman) Uh-huh.
Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another mistake.
No. I know what I want.
I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...
Mona a Baldo .
Oh, then I lost interest.
I wouldn't worry about it. B-6?
He was 96 years old.
Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.
Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me.
Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.
I'm looking for a crested blazer
Hey
How can I live there?
'...down town.'
Nice!
Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.)
(to the phone) Hello?
Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?
Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down. (To Elaine) What?
This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.
So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought.... And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me.
I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.
No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?
I think I saw one a coupla doors down.
Oh, the "triangle" guy.
You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.
You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!
