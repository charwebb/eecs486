Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.
You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
(placatory) Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me.
If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?
(in the hallway, hearing the door lock behind him, turns back) Kramer!
Yeah. a-hu. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?
Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.
A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little decision.
Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.
Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.
You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store.
Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to rides alone.
When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion.
He went to get some steak sauce. Why?
George- What?! Youre kidding... Well, whats wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, Ill speak to you later. (He hangs up.) Wilkinson, the guy whos supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, hes in the hospital.
That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and-
Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.
He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.
Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?
(Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! A dinosaur!
He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.
I don't know what to tell you, Elton.
But you were supposed to get me a refund.
(Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.
Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?
Um, you know, its the damnedest thing. It went away.
(taking the envelope) Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em.
oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this.
I-I-I don't like the opera. What are they singing for? Who sings? You got something to say, say it!
(to George) He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.
Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?
I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that? (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying)
Oh no, where's the blood? (opens the fridge) It's in here isn't it?
(smiling) Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.
Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.
Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents.
Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom.
Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...
Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?
How many years of med school did you have?
I thought you said you were a good driver!
It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.
(thinking) Well, the drive home should be a delight. Im speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I dont care. (to Vanessa) That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room?
I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.
So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.
So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist. You just called the woman for a date.
Already? That was fast... I assume he's not a High Talker...
What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?
Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.
(Handing her a small bottle) Here, drink this.
Oh, no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down. (George & Jerry each slide to the end of their booth seats)
(To Nina) Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy, huh?
Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you.
Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
You want to spend the rest of your life with her
I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.
(putting the phone back to his ear) Yeah.
(back in booth) He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life.
Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?
Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
You think they have fleas there, don't you?
Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?
A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?
You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!
No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. Whats important is you two getting back together. Eh, then well talk about the car.
(to Kramer) So how's your karate class going?
You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?
I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?
So lemme ask you this how long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night.
Did you at least get him a card?
You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!
No, Uncomfortable? Not at all. (ASIDE TO ELAINE) My friend's wife's breast sticking out - why would that make me uncomfortable?
(locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.
Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.
Oh, like you know what you're talking about!
Oh, I cant. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly.
(quickly moves over toward Matthew) What the *beep*(fuck) are you doing? You little piece of *beep*(shit)!
Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.
Here you go. (Poppie stands up and takes the money.) Anyway, I'm sorry again about the...(notices a large, wet stain on his couch)...the...the...
(aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!
(mind's voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?
Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Jerry hugs Kramer, then grabs him by the cheeks.) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think Im in the clear here. Elaines not moving in. I dont have to confront her. She has no idea I never wanted her to move in. Im golden!
Just, uh, plop it on the counter there.
Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one.
Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?
Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.
I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.
The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?
Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than "coffee machine show."
I think if ones going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. Its common courtesy. I dont know. Thats just the way I was brought up.
Is there, something I can help you with?
Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.
Listen, Joel. Theres something I have to tell you...
(Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.
Why don't you go out? It's nice out.
You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola!
(emphatic) I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!
I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door...
No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)
Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.
George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.
Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing. Perhaps it's an homage.
You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?
Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?
I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back.
Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.
Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.
So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?
No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time?
Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly.
How about our little Elaine huh? Attended the finest finishing schools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions. Debutante balls. Look at her now. Interviewing Mohels.
Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.
Go ahead shake his hand. You're Jerry Seinfeld. You've been on the Tonight Show.
You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?
No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.
Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.
Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and tear.
Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you.
Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.
Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.
Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something.
Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...
So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.
What happened to your head when you got hit?
Im going out. (he comes out of the dressing room, while Kramer remains inside)
All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.
I would know if I had a blender.
Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!
No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?
What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present)
Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over my side.
So she tought I did it to get back at her
(as Kristin is storming out) Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?
Not because youre dirty, not because youre clean  just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine...
(extemporising) That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go.
So why don't they talk like that now?
(shakes his head) I'm very sorry. (closing the door on Phil. Jerry smiles and shrugs apologetically as Phil stares at them through the glass)
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.
Well put something down, youre taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac and Artie, theyre all coming over here before the wedding?
Hey come on, you're getting it all over the floor!
(pause, to Donna) You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name...
See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.
Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.
He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world "I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable." (George is baffled)
These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin' to make that call! (George comes in)
It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?
No social reason for them to be here.
So you don't cry when your grandmother dies? But a hotdog makes you lose control?
(to George) Is that uh, other apartment still available?
You raise the feet, get blood to the head.
Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.
Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?
(CONT'D) You want me to help you with that?
Well what about me! If you're going like that, I?m not going like this.
What, your sad little horsies, the house with the little curl of smoke, the sunflower with the smiley face. the transparent cube... (as she leaves)
I dont even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, Ive met them three times in my life.
Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.
Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.
It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.
Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)
Oh, no. I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with it.
(Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.
Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours. (And with that, Jerry made the most fatal mistake of his life)
How can I ever have you over? Youll sit there moping.
Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!
Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?
I said, "How come no one's killed her?" Probably shouldn't have said anything,
Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners.
Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go.
You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here. Mike Wichter. He sold plastic straws. You know the ones? You could bend them.
What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?
Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.
Hey buddy. I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's like in there, all night long things are creaking and cracking. And that red light is burning my brain!
So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.
(Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?
Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..
Well, the pickle breath is a good start.
No, its not that. It wasnt all one-sided.
I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket)
(Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.
I don't know , Who keeps track of Hellos.
See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.
Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you?
Im Jerry, Elaines friend, and this is George.
Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.
That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me.
Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log.
(pointing to Kramer's hair) You got some suds over here.
Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him )
Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.
(holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.
Hold it, hold it...Look your gonna need the jaws of life to get out of those things.
Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket.
No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.
I mean, if were gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.
Yknow Im sorry you had to leave so early the other night.
Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test?
Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.
Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.
Oh my God is that the new perfume?
What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like it?
(startled - eyes wide open) Hello, is somebody there? (scurrying sound) Mr.- Mr. Marbles?
Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'
(on the phone) Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Ya. Oh, really? Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye. (hangs up the phone) Well, the yogurt verdict is in. (Kramer looks at Jerry with his arms out) Fat!
Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.
A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see 'em. Come on, I'm calling! (thumps hand on table) What d'you got!
Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.
Theres one thing I dont understand. Why does it please you? (to the phone) George Costanza, please.
They're ladies' glasses! You know all you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.
Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case.
"They get all emotional , they sway. It's embarrassing."
Relax, hes late. Hes always late. Its part of his M.O.
There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.
Maybe we should get you to a hospital.
Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.
Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.
Why don't you put it in the *bank*?
So I guess , you're not getting married?
Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, Yeah, I got this new thing Platonic. My idea, my name, callin it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- dont do anything, and go right home. Whatd you think? I think its going to be big! I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didnt work. Yknow, I bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, Uh, Hi, uh my names Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, its a Riconic relationship.
Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.
Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?
Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer!
So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?
This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.
Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.
I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.
(on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel! (hangs up the phone very disappointed)
Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. Its completely shrunk. Theres absolutely no way I can wear it.
Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.
Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide.
That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I got.
You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?
Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?
Why can't I buy my father a car?
The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?
There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.
Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.
What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?
OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you know you are always welcome in my home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story.
Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them.
"Did you notice he always refer to himself in the third person. Jimmy can dunk. Jimmy's new in town. Jimmy we'll see you later."
Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.
Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" or, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" You emphasize "Jerry" or "bring."
Yeah well King Edward didnt live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.
So tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?
Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.
So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.
It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!
Hey, what happened to your coat? And what is the smell? Is-ya, What are you drunk?
(annoyed) All right. (after a pause) Hey, you know what's weird?
You want to get something to eat first?
I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I dont get this. Arent cows outside most of the time? I dont understand it. When its raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, Let us in, were all wearin leather. Open the door! Were gonna ruin the whole outfit here! Is it suede? I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I cant have this cleaned. Its all I got!
Uh, you don't have to take a picture.
You didn't like that crack about the pen.
Ok, great, well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu.
Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man.
All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.
Hey. It's you! (pointing) Th..that's my Friars Club jacket!
Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!
We're gonna have to talk about this later. (Elaine holds the door open for Jerry while holding her leg) Thank you. Taxi!
A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the dish and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit.
(handing his dad a gift) Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.
How come? I told you - It's fantastic.
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.
Nice Mohel picking, Elaine. You picked a helluva Mohel!
Hey, is that my maple syrup? Oh, ya. (Kramer hands it over.)
Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.
(To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom buzzes) That's Elaine. (Kramer buzzes her in. Jerry talks into the phone) Kramer.. (To Kramer) George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.
See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.
Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them.
I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad?
So you dont know whats wrong with him?
All right, so uh, let's do something later. How 'bout a movie?
Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house?
No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.
I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life.
No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)
You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?
You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.
Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting. I'd have to get new friends. I'd have to get orgy friends. ... Naw, I'm not ready for it.
You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. (Picks up the phone.) She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...
So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!
I don't think I can be that nice.
I know, I just can't bring myself to do it meanwhile that freezer keeps getting smaller and smaller (she smiles) (Elaine looks at her watch) oh, don't wanna keep Tony waiting
All right. You know this girl Clare I am seeing?
(picks up the phone on the coffee table) 555-3455. Well wait a second, don't you see that's 555-FILK.
Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
He yells and you don't get your soup.
What do you need a job, you got Audrey.
Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips.
(on phone)Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.... it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye.
He doesn't even care if a man answers.
I don't understand what the big deal is.
You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.
Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?
What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.
May I see you outside for a moment please?
Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?
What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what they're saying.
No I wasn't there. (enters and slams the door)
You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.
Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.
If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.
She likes him I mean she really likes him.
Uh, I don't know, we used to go out.
How do you get all that wood in here?
Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.
There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...
I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. Shes going to move in.
Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.
(Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really?
Fasten your seat belts. we're goin' to see the baby.
Oh my eh, my Aunt's name is Mulva. She's-she's a masseuse.
Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
Now, there's a career path you may have overlooked.
(nudging George) Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.
Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?
I had a very interesting lunch with GEORGE Costanza today.
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.
So, its okay? I could just tell her she can have it?
I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--
I mean I met her three times. I dont even know her last name.
Im worried I wont be able to talk to him. Hes such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.
So you just did the opposite of everything?
If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.
Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department.
Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. >click click<
All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.
What's going on here. How is that possible?
I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different... sources.
Well, we need change and all I have is twenties.
Oh yeah, Sfuzi? I- I've gotta do that.
Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that?
Hey look ,you know, you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here. You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me.
Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.
Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?
Of course I can, am I being funny now?
(realising) Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. It belongs to the Friars Club.
U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you?
Plus Im wearing short sleeves, I dont want to expose my tattoos. (Vanessa smiles; thinking) Shes unbelievable!
I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' (mimes throwing) 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?
Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.
Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.
That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.
(to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? (wondering what the hell's Kramer doing)
Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will.
Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.
Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.
Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. He's a punk, a patsy, a hack.
Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.
Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at no more than three miles an hour.
What do you mean not going? why not?
Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?
Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!
Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.
It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?
Oh and I've got some things of yours here.
No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.
No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o.
(Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.
What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?
What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.
(hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman.
If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld.
Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?
Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
Hello? Yeah he's here. (to Kramer) Hey! It's for you.
It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.
You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry?
Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her Im sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.
Its not promised to anybody? Cause shed take it in a second.
(hitting metal with the first strike of the shovel) Well, that was easy.
You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.
(to Morty) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street!
(Trying to read the note) What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit.
Elaine is having a "houseguest." She's picking him up at the airport tonight.
I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
(on the phone) hey Andre, get the hell off the phone!
Oh, I was just looking for er, some... gum or... mint.
Why did you force that mint on me? I told ya I didn't want the mint!
Im not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. Ive decided Ill do the work. Im gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? Cause you send your money out there  working for you  a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me. Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.
Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...
How am I going to live with myself?!
Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.
Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.
So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!
If there's a serial killer lose in your neighborhood, it seems like the safest thing is to be the neighbor. They never kill the neighbor. The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right? "Oh, he was kind of quiet." I love these neighbors. They're never disturbed by the sounds of murdering, just stereo. Chain saws, people screaming, fine. Just keep the music down. And all these women who always fall in love with the serial killer. They write to him in prison. Here's a woman that's hard to disappoint. I guess she's only upset when she finds out he's stopped killing people and she goes "You know sometimes I feel like I don't even know who you are anymore".
Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for show.
So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?
Where are you going, you just got here?
Yeah. Im having a wonderful time. (it's obvious he isn't)
He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.
What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?
Uh, hang on a second, You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck.
Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.
Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.
My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on. (Kramer enters with a bucket and starts filling it with water on the sink) Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.
I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?
Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.
There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.
Let me get a clean pair. (Goes into his room. George strides over to the window.)
Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers?
So ah, what did you do last night?
No, I do not like the bank. Ive heard the expression Laughing all the way to the bank. I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when theres nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, its empty and you still have to go through the little maze. (walking on the stage like he is going through a maze) Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? Im almost at the front. Id like a reward for this please.
O.k., good, I'll see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.)
Look Kramer, i-i-if I'm gonna live over there, y-y-you gotta take some of this stuff out. I mean this thing is really freaking me out (holds up a ventriloquist dummy). I feel like its gonna come to life in the middle of the night and kill me.
All right, all right, I?ll wear this. It's bad enough I?ve got to go to the opera I?ve got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here.
Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up)
C'mon up. (To George) Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'
She was looking for someone to go to the show with.
Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a...
So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.
Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may depend on it.
(advancing on Gary) ...and he told me that that... (becomes indistinct)
We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk.
(on the phone) Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye. (hangs up the phone)
What, you got a problem with the pen now?
No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier. (Elaine drinks straight out of the orange juice container) Hey.
And where does it end? Then everyones doin it. Its like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, "Dont go there." - Someones gotta take a stand!
Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.
So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more "grease monkey".
Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.
So, I guess you dont find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?
About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?
Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.
(Jokingly playing off Kramer's statement) With a different body.
No kidding. (thinking) Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!
Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.
(Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!
Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.
Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)
It was the single worst moment of my life.
(is redialing) I should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.
Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read.
Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land.
I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it.
(Being frank) Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.
I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?
Well at least you and I are okay again.
Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.
See I was saying "six" but she thought I was saying "sex". We straightened the whole thing out though.
I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.
I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)
Yeah, yeah, take care of it. (Jerry throws her some toilet paper) Come on, George, what is it?
You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it?
What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him?
Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes outside)
Yeah, well, I didnt- Is that something you want to borrow?
What's even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics.
Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.
People are going to steal from you. You cant stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker, whos gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They cant get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.
Okay. I'll get it. (Goes into the bedroom.)
Leo's furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at George's book) What is that doing on the table?
Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe well get together.
Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?
You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.
Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I cant ask her.
(impatiently cutting in) Hey Elaine What about the crest.? What d'you think of the crest here.
Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.
Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?
Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.
No, I just wanted to see what time it was.
All the time. Ive been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I cant live like this. I dont know what Im gonna do. Im heading for breakdown! (to Harold) Cant you do something?
What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you.
You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?
Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy.
Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.
Oh yeah, well why don?t you Just get lost.
Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia, watching Jerry on TV. Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.
So he just shaves his head for no reason?
Oh no. Thats impossible. Id rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.
Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do?
Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?
Who wouldn't like him? I like him. And I'm a guy.
Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here (points to kitchen), here (points to living room), or here (makes similar circle with his hands).
I don't have your suit. I gave it away.
How do you know she's not my wife?
The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.
Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye.
Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?
Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent. It's very boring.
Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.
She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.
It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.
I might need you to get me a soda.
Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?
And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry)
You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.
You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it)
Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, "This is good, who is this? I like this person". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, (pretending to wake up) "Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!"
Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, "Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. " "What are you watching?" "I don't care, I gotta keep going." "Who was that?" "I don't know what it was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going." Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, "Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel." You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, "Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of here. I'm going to bed."
Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the sirens song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?
But I don't know if this is gonna work.
I like that thing in your hair there.
Yeah, I cant eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I cant dance.
(to Elaine) Where's Kramer? Shouldn't he be here by now.
Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?
Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy. You don't have to mention the bubble boy? I know about the bubble boy. I'm aware of the bubble boy. Why do you keep reminding me about the bubble boy?
I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or somebody? What's with this guy? (Gino looks at him annoyed) Just asking.
Youre you. Were having lunch with Art Corvelay.
Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on.
If I see her, what do I say that Im doing here in the building?
What causes homophobia? What is it, that makes a heterosexual man, worry? I think it's because, men know, that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, "Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'"
(Shouting) Come on up! (Opens his door for Elaine)
So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.
Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'
People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.
What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them.
No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.
An inch! Can you move over an inch?!?
I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. (Miss Rhode Island laughs.)
Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference who's tall. We're all tall.
You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?
Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer!
But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.
I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.
You know, if your future was a little more certain..
Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)
Well I think I get the gist of it.
But I could do that and the music.
I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine!
You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?
Oh that's George. (presses the intercom button) Yeah?
(pulling out a tape from his pocket) Vvvvup. Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your feet up?
I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.
We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?
I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.
We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)
Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh...
No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.
Okay. (closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self) Didn't come true.
Women need to like the job of the guy theyre with. If they dont like the job, they dont like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. Well, right now, Im the regional management supervisor. Im in development, research, consulting... Men on the other hand  if they are physically attracted to a woman  are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men dont really care. Menll just go, Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? Youre just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why dont you shower up, and well get some burgers and catch a movie.
Well, this is it. I'm really gonna do something about my life, you know? You know, I think I'm gonna call Melanie again. So what if she shushed me. GEORGE, I am really gonna make some changes.
All right. (opens door - Red light floods hallway - a buzzing sound emanates.)
Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain?
I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?
Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.
Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!
(as George picks up a broken piece of his car) You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out...
(after the guy) You think you're better than me?
Youre movin in, youre a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars. (Elaine is shocked, Jerry opens the door to the hall.) Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I dont even wanna see it, go, get it out.
Oh, Hey, there's a name you don't forget.
So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?
No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.
(after a very awkward pause, cheerily) Hey, neighbor.
I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.
Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.
Were taking Elaine to dinner. Shes got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?
Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.
I bought you a Cadillac. (hands over the keys) Here you go.
Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...
I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment for two days. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my parents. they'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own I'm sure it's gonna be some awful dump. Wait a second.. Have you checked in The Plaza yet?
You gotta go to my chiropractor, hes the best.
No, no I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like the title and insisted that he change it to "War and Peace"!
Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?
I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. (casually leaves)
I don't know, but we don't have much time.
So I know this guy. Im getting all my sneakers at a discount now.
Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. (Holds lettuce head) Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts the intellect, represented here (Pulls off tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large piece) Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats tiny piece of lettuce)
Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on?
Im gonna make an appointment for you. Well go together.
Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?
I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.
I think what he's trying to say is, "get the bouilla-base." (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)
Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.
Okay, Okay, I promise. (puts on the headphones again) Wow!!! Oh Man...Oh God.. Oh Brother....Whoooaaaa!! Whoaaaa (Elaine enters he takes them off rapidly)
He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.
Yeah have a couple of pieces, weak, weak gum yeah
So know every time you get dressed. You are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer.
There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?
Alright, sit down, sit down. (Grabs a pill from the bottle, and starts advancing tward Kramer - like an owner with his dog)
So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal, (steer).
That voice. That voice. Shes driving me crazy.
(to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello.
How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?
And you didnt even hear how she sounded.
Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. (George laughs) So, when do you move into the apartment?
Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested)
(walking over the the buzzer to answer it) Oh, that's the Flicks.
(Nervous laughter) Yeah.. like a pirate.. (Attempting to get on another subject) Anyway, ah, you know, we're hoping to, um, raise enough money.. with this.. uh..
George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman!
Should I get it? I hate these moments. Im hearing the dual voices now, you know, What about the money? Whats money?
It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.
I was going to say, "Being a good host."
I don't believe this. (They run into theater)
I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.
No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.
Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.
Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.
Yeah. (hands racquet to Kramer) I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it.
Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work.
Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...
Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god. Wel-- how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud.
The fabric of society is very complex George.
Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.
All right, go, it's a race! Come on!
I just got the most bizarre message from you father, Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!
They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?
Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.
I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.
So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.
A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?
Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.
Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him.
Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town.
I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
I dont know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I cant decide.
He used to go there a lot on business.
Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
So what your genitals are still lined up.
I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway.
No. The police have no leads (sitting on the couch arm) and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.
Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?
Its great! It speeds up the intimacy level. Its like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish (snaps his fingers) three days.
If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened.
Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.
Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.
Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I would've asked her.
Who figures and immigrants gonna have a pony?
But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment shes going right for that machine.
Yeah... hes specializing in whales. He's working on lowering the cholesterol level, in whales all that blubber -- quite unhealthy. You know its the largest mammal on earth but as George says "they don't have to be."
That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
Yeah, so Joey?s a great lover of the opera
So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?
The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal.
Let's check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil.
Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.
Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.
And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard-working Americans!
She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.
Thats the bet! That youre not doing it!
We make all these plans - this idiot goes a hundred miles an hour - the whole weekend's over - incredible - just like that -
Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.
Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?
(as Kramer walks by) You're a master of race relations.
Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?
Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.
Uh, how about a couple of people like us.
Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.
Just put a coffee table book over it.
I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.
No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.
Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it!
The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.
My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? (to the intercom)
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye. (Hangs up) Hey, I'm flyin' first class.
I think that would be a very nice gesture.
Yes I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition...
Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.
Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it.
Whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guyll be like, I dont think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life? And of course the womans looking at the guy, thinking, What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?
It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination. I would have killed this man. Torn him limb from limb, ripped the flesh right off his bones ...
Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump over the net.
I'm in the book and I have a machine.
How come you're eating your peas one at a time?
I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.
Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to Elaine)
Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.
You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.
So you have no control over the remote?
What's happening? What, you doing, come and talk to us.
Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want.
I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.
No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.
See, its never as bad as you imagine.
Why can't you do this on your table?
Yeah, Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would you describe Kramer's hair?
He went crazy from one note. He couldnt get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.
So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up The good, the bad, or the ugly.
Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little longer)
(uncertain) Don't you hire people to do that?
(takes the card from Elaine) We had a little fight this afternoon. (reading from card) Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe.
Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.
So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouth-to-mouth.
Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.
No, it's a nine-hundred S. (happy) It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo!
Alright.. (Heads for the door, grabbing his coat)
(in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.
She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass.
Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters)
Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.
No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?
Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.
The captain of the toes. (phone rings) Hello.
Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.
You know I don't even know why I brought you.
Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?
We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.
The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.
I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.
Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?
Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.
Toilet brush, oh (he pulls a 'Damn, shoulda guessed!' face). Alright, I can replace that.
Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.
Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?
All right, lets go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.
Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!
What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?
(tearing through his laundry bag) Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on, let's go.
Well, you want to sit with George? I think he's coming with Robin.
Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.]
Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.
You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.
So have your parents found out about it?
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. ! Celebrate! How about some champagne?
'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?
Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?
No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe it. I lost him. That stupid idiot. Now what are we going to do?
Hey what about Dr. Resnick My Uncle Leo is going to see him tomorrow .
No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!
Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie.
How could you leave a message like that on my machine.?
Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?
Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.
"Just one....gotta go back.....Oh but get this. Elaine, you will appreciate this. I'm sitting in Tim Whatley's waiting room...He's got a Penthouse right out on the table."
everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah?
Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
Oh, w-what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore?
Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?
(trying to shut the trunk hood) Something wrong with this trunk.
Oh, I cant believe it. Let me see that. (Jerry takes the paper.) Thats four and a half points in three days! Thats almost half my money!
I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?
Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to give it up.
What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?
I'll see you tonight. (he's opening his door apartment as Kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe)
She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.
Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one.
(Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did!
Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.
Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way.
Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?
Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's leftovers.
I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes.
Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.
No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?
Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly.
Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.
What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?
I could tell you what I did, but you wouldnt believe it. Its not believable.
That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. (goes knocking on Kramer's)
(Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not.
No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'
Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
Well, its a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.
So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that...
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.
And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone.
How are we gonna get out of it?
(to himself) Once a week? (to Uncle Leo) So how's Lydia?
Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town.
First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.
So Kramer, what are you going to do?
It's a movie stub from the 930 show. George, I think Willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes.
It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.
(on the phone) Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.
Well there's always a place for you, on our team.
(to the phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)
Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.
Ate? What? What the hell are you talking about? Now you listen to me, you get out of that apartment this instant. If you screw this up for me I swear....
Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers?
Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.
I don't know how I feel about it.
Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.
(Joking around) Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.
Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs phone up)
(Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say "Hi", and I say "Hello".
Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
Are you sure he cant hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.
Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?
What are we doing out here? Aren't we going to go in and eat?
Here. Take a look. What, what is that?
Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again.
I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, "This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here."
Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?
Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?
The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.
You cant go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.
Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?
That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this?
If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.
So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?
Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.
Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.
That's a hell of an organization they're running up there. I can't understand why they haven't won a pennant in 15 years.
Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)
No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything off me, first laughs now ladies.
Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.
Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. (opens the fridge and gets a bottle of water.)
Whenever I see the news and they're hauling in some kind of terrorist, psycho, maniac, mass murderer guy. You notice he's always covering up his face with the newspaper, with the jacket, with the hat. What is he worried about? I mean what is this man's reputation? That he has to worry about this kind of exposure damaging his good name? I mean, what is he up for a big job promotion down at the office or something? Afraid the boss is gonna catch this on TV and go "isn't that Johnson from sales? He's up in that clock tower picking people off one by one. I don't know if that's that kind of man we want heading up that new branch office. He should be in bill collection. I think he's got aptitude."
When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!
Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.
No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.
Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.
Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.
Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.
I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I cant stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion wont even exist. It wont. I think eventually well all be wearing the same thing. Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where theres people from the future or another planet, theyre all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided, This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and boots. Thats it. We should come up for an outfit for Earth. An Earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits. No speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, That was nice. I could wear that.
She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing to George) He likes the pop-in, too.
(naked, carrying a belt sander) I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.
Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!
Im Dan. Can I have my list back, please?
Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.
My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?
Well, go in there and talk to her. She's not going to put em on the glass.
(hangs up the phone) Yeah, I really needed that suit.
Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!
Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.
Just get the key and let's get out of here.
That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!
What if he doesn't call now out of spite?
(stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem?
She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?
Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?
Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!
Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.
Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up)
All right, now you call it in the air.
My whole night's ruined. I didn't do any sets, didn't do any movies...
Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet?
I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.
(Interrupts) Excuse me...Excuse me... Are you asking him out ?
No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?
Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?
Aww, right. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it!
You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?
Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage.
I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.
I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night only, the big screen. My hands are tied!
Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.
Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.
So you were with him that day at the track?
Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey!
I dont know. He said hed call back.
So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.
(a la "Don Corleione") Elaine, never ask me about my business!.... (SHEEPISH) "Godfather."
Look, you can hang out here if you want.
At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.
So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night...
Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!
Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats right behind the glass?
No, look, you don't understand. I, I want the picture.
Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...
Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. (holds his nose up like a pig) You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.
No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.
Aah! .. right. The ones from Oregon that are only ripe for two weeks a year..
It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?
Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?
(Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?
Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.
Best friend- Ive never been to your apartment.
You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldnt expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.
Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guys out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, its true, men hear a drill, its like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, Honey, I think Jims working on something over there. So they run over to the guy. Now they dont actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. Thats what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, What are you using, a Phillips-head? You know, we feel involved. Thats why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, thats just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they dont cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, thatll hold.
Come on! I know it's something you wanna do! (she pulls harder and he falls right off the table)
(uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.
No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.
Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?
Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.
So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?
He might want a show about anything and everything.
So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!
Donna, really, youre making too much of this.
What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods.) Did he tell you whats gonna happen? (George shakes his head.) How long were you there?
She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was "Beaches" for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?
Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.
Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.
Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.
Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.
Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.
Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer. It shows at least he's making an effort.
You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs.
Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.
"Don't you see what's happened, he couldn't talk , he's wearing these shoes, he's drooling."
(In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so.
Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors.
Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye.
It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook?
Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?
Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?
Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.
Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.
So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.
Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine?
I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.
What, What is this? What is she doing here?
Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets.
I didnt open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.
You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.
That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The Mohel circumcised my finger!
How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?
Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
(to Rava) So, wheres this boyfriend of yours? I cant wait much longer. Ive got a flight.
George, I want you to promise me something. If Im ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.
I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've been so helpful.
But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?
Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?
(long pause).......Sure. ( humms a song then stares at the toothbrush)
I cant think about it now. Come on, Im going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.
Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.
(To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?
I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.
No, I actually find you quite charming. A bit verbose at times...
(looking of into the distance) I guess that's true...
Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!
how can u say things like that over the phone?
Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.
So why don't you leave it at Newman's?
Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.
Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. If you're there it'll be a better group.
Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.
I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, Im in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants.
And you want to be my latex salesman.
They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.
I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.
Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back
That's what a gym teacher once told me.
Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.
(to George) So did you bring the lease? (George takes the lease from his inside pocket and hands it to Jerry.) All right, gee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time.
Kramer, do you realize what's going on here? Do you know why you're here?
I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel.
It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.
Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.
But you made it through the day before.
Although what if its one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?
All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, "It's been real," move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.
You're passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago!
Elaine, you cannot judge a person on a situation like that. I mean it's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert
Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump across.
Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.
No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
(examining the button) Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like a tooth.
Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.
I noticed she's big on the phrase "yada yada."
(looking at the cop) What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think he's getting coffee.!
I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.
Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?
Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. Alright, it's time to go. Come on.. Up.
Thats different. I didnt have feelings for those people. But you, youll backslide
Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.
Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad.
Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?
Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly) and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it.
I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...
No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.
Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)
I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.
You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!
Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?
Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.
I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.
(interrupting) "Elaine , I really don't...............pay much attention to men`s faces."
Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price?
Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there.
Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.
... if this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this woman to help me I would have killed this man. I would have strangled the life out of him with my bare hands
(continuing unphased) You wanna get the other end, cause I wanna get it in the hall.
You told Testikov, (Elaine nods) that Tolstoy wanted to name his book "War-- What Is IT Good For?"?
I know, and then you say to yourself, From this moment on, Im not gonna waste any more of it. But then you go, How? What can I do thats not wasting it?
Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?
Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!
Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.
I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? (Kramer comes in) A real dermatologist.
This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!
Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh...
Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.
All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?
(taking out his wallet and handing over bills grudgingly) Fifty dollars.
No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.
(To bartender) Can I have a club soda? (To Ronnie) Goin' on tonight?
Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do some TV spots for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store. That was Leapin' Larry himself, I'm gonna meet with him tomorrow.
I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!
Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?
(spits the nut) OooH!!! You. you ate these? You sucked on these and put them on the plate?
Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually do it)
Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here.
But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.
Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.
Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.
Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa.
Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?
Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.
(acidly) Shes full. So, Big Daddy. Im just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?
Well, we fight a lot for some reason.
Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!
He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.
Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?
I guess you can take anything, but actual work.
So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?
...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, "Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now." "This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration." You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration, (waves imaginary wallet) "Here's fifty-six people that know me." Cop goes. "Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check."
Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing "no") A little taste! (still shaking) Come on. (still shaking)
(smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good.
Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. (Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks at Kramer.)
Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?
Well, its a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno...
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers...
Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?
(Reading from his notebook) I got You enter, you go "Hi", and I go, "Hello." Now.. we need something here..
No no come on really, get another one. Itll take a second.
Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.
Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?
I think I heard her say something about a bench.
To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go "Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch." According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.
Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. Youve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?
George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?
I don't have any change. You've got any change?
(hands it to him as he asks ELAINE) So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?
Kramer!!! (Jerry points to the lamp post they are about to crash into)
Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.
(To Assistant) I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?
Kramer! (tries to hide he's upset and jealous)
So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?
(thoughtful) Hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey, there it is.
They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys.
There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?
Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?
(Takes the bottle from him) Just swallow 'em.
I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example.
Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the check to Elaine) look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.
So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil
What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?
I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.
Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?
I'll tell you, that There for you crap was a stroke of genius.
Oh my god, he knows. (Jerry and Gino scrambling) Go. (yelling to the door) One second.
In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?
So forget about the books. Did you read them?
Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
Im just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.
Hey ya know I read an unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the other day, did you know the original title for "War and Peace" was "War--What Is It Good For?"!
Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?
For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.
Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.
Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.
Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!
I like your nails, that is a great color.
Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.
No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 1030.
So it had nothing to do with you.
What do you think? It's like a poker game?
(eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.
(to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)
Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both killed!
(pointing to napkins; to Elaine) Could I get napkin over there?
Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy.
Um, I haven't got my watch on. It's being fixed.
It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck!
Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine.
Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.
Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy.
(walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.
Am I going? It was three nights ago.
All right, so youre chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead.
Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.
I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?
Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.
The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the other -person.
I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.
I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!
Kramer, (Trying to pass him) get outta my way!
Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination? You couldn't possibly visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life size snotty puppet. I guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. That's the end of the line for a mannequin. "What ever happened to Bob?" "Have you seen that new Volvo commercial? He's got a bulls eye right in his face." Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, I guess these are the two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves. Well dressed or getting killed. I'm sure there is some pro-mannequin organization that doesn't even like you to use the term mannequin. "Hey they're not mannequins, they're the life deprived."
I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.
Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this, now she's got nothing.
So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?
Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.
A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?
Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?
Yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder)
Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, "Hey, they like the soup! Keep it up!"?
I don't have to be funny, I don't care.
(Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!
How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it.
(to the Drake) Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye...
Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?
Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea.
Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.
Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.
Oh, heh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.
Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--
To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in, in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in "morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? fine" Ten minutes later you see him in the hall, "How ya doin'?" Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow "Hey" You start coming up with nicknames for them. "Jimbo."
Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a men's room. That's the end of that.
Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.
(to Elaine, still joking) He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!
(pointing at Georges shirt) See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. Its too high! Its in no-mans-land. You look like you live with your mother.
Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.
Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye.
So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.
No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.
Fourteen years down the drain. (points and walks off -- to the bathroom)
And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?
No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.
hey where were you last night? I looked for you, I didn't see you
Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime.
Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.
So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?
No, It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago . she's trying to become an actress.
If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.
I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.
So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did?
No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.
No, hes It. He wins. It is good.
How ya doing? (George nods) Can't talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his brace) Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his eyebrows) I like that. (George sticks his tongue out) So how's life without tonsils? (George quickly indicates with his arm that he wants ice cream) What? What's that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?.. (George signals that it's more) Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy.. (George motions for ice cream again) What are you doing?
Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here.
The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.
There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?
Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want? You're not a part of society.
Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.
Oh. (chuckles) Really? You don't seem that desperate.
I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.
I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.
She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.
Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.
Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)
She wanted to thank us for the apartment.
Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!
Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?
I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.
Ah, actually, I ka, kinda had some things to do.
You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?
But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.
But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
Got 'em on the street, from a scal... (catches himself again)
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em. (starts backing away as Kramer follows him around the room carrying the underwear)
(acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?
Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?
They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?
Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?
Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.
Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?
(Nodding) I think you may have something there.
There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.
(in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine) So did you figure out Darryl's... you know.
You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.
For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.
Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.
Well, I dont really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.
We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.
(bored) Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it.
Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?
All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go.
(opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.
Now we have to buy a new couch?!
How many times you been out with him?
Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.
You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.
I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that.
Kramer's Andre, he's fooling around with these 976 numbers (Kramer walks out of the bedroom) hey I told you, I don't want you doing that on my phone
I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
All right. As long as youre okay. Because I cant stop thinking about her.
Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.
Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!
Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...
So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner?
They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?
Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.
(George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party?
You know what? That was the amazing thing.
Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!
(To Elaine) Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get some coffee.
Wow! Zanadu . No wonder youre putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) May I?
(pulling Leo back in) Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you.
Okay, you tell me. What is it worth?
I don't even know if I remember the number.
..living together after a while we... we might start to get on each others nerves a little.
(looking behind the counter) Hey, is that Babu? It is! (walking over) Hey, Babu!
Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.
People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.
All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.
Are you sure? Oh boy, here we go.
And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.
So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.
Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese. (buys a newspaper out of a machine)
Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' "Where's your jock strap?" Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.
(seeing Fredo's tombstone) Oh, my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up! (hands the shovel to Kramer)
(interrupting) No no it's ok. (walking Rachel out) So we'll go see Schindler's List later right?
Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Just give me a little squeeze.
I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?
It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.
That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!
I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.
Come on. Something's on your mind. Out with it.
I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! No!!! Thank you. (Hangs up.) I don't believe this. They've added Bania to the network showcase and he's going on right after me.
(interrupts) What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today. (on the phone) Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we would do that. Okay. Great! Thanks a million! Okay, bye.
I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)
On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?
Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.
Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.
George, I didnt sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. Im just going to be honest. Thats all... Yes, Im nervous... Are you listening to me?... Just put some soap on your finger. Itll slide right off... Then try axle grease... (Kramer enters; to the phone) Ill call you back after I talk to her... Bye.
Ah, just remember when you see him tomorrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him.
And she was beautiful in that bra! I'm crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging, free wheeling attitude!
Alright, that's it.. (Grabs Kramer, trying to pull him out of the car)
Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!
Hey, guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!
Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. (The door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.
(playing Scrabble with his naked girlfriend) Zephyr? That is not a word.
(Losing it, mad) Look, it's not my shirt.
Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place.
Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) "Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."
(privately amused) Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while. (indicating Elaine) Her too.
Good shake. Perfect shake. Single pump, not too hard, you know, doesn't have to prove anything, but, you know, firm enough to know he was there.
Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if its done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels!
You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.
The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?
Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal.
Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? There's no grace period.
You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about the Costanzas'
What is it she think you can't do?
To the Paul Simon concert in the park!
I think I saw one a coupla doors down.
Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice.
But then anyone can just look in and see you.
No, go ahead. Look at this place. I cant wait to get it cleaned.
Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.
So write a letter.. move to another...move to Staten Island., 'lot easier to blend in a sea of people in Staten Island than China believe me.
I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating.
Kramer, why do you have to (noticing Newman) Hello, Newman.
I think the thing I admire most about the Chinese is that they're hanging in there with the chopsticks. Because, if you think about it, you know, they've seen the fork... by now. I'm sure they've seen the spoon, they're going, "Yeah, yeah, they're OK... We're going to stay with the sticks." I mean, I don't know how they've missed it, thousands of years ago, Chinese farmer gets up, has his breakfast with the chopsticks, goes out and works all day in the field with a shovel... Hello?... Shovel! Not going out there ploughing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues.
Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. (George gives Elaine a look while Jerrys back is turned. Jerry turns around.) I saw that.
And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now.
That's what I do with him [points at George]
Well, I just want you to know I'm there for you. Course now I'm here for you, but when i'm not here for you, i'm there for you.
Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And Ill need that in the form of a question.
You better finish your little caf latte there. They won't let you in with it.
I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.
I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.
All right, just give me a western. (unhappy)
This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.
What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back.
So, tell me anyway. Who was the BIG mastermind?
So, ah, what are you doing around here Ramon?
Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George.
Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.
So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't?
I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for him for a second.
(testing Joel) So, Im thinking about going to Iran this summer.
Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*!
(aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?
"Of course" was the last thing he said?
(Smiling, like a salesman) All right. Now, what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today?
You stink. You know you stink. What is this?
Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!
Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice?
Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) Thats it. Done!
Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?
You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand?
Uh, yeah. (broaching a subject) Hey uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to a meeting.
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!
(also wearing a moustache) What do you mean, 'what is it?' It's a country right next to Belgium.
I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.
You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. (with a British accent) "Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you".
I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.
Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.
I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.
I don't think the network will go for it.
(Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What?
(to Kramer) Hold on a second. (to Morty) Hiya dad.
I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?
(quiet) Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..
Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.
So, uh, whats your son doing now, Dr. Stevens? Oh, hes a public fornicator. Yes, hes a fine boy...
Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.
(Scoffing) Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.
What happened to you? You were going like a hundred miles an hour.
Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?
(Making nothing of it) So? Who cares about that?
In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.
He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?
What do you care? You don't believe in hell.
Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! (Kramer exits.)
Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.
Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?
Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.
Damn, I was too overanxious, he must have noticed that.
Yeah, I took her home one night  we kinda started up a little bit in the car.
But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?
Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.
No, I don't want that smell in the house.
Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.
Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt.
hey you know it's weird because that voice sounded a little familiar to me
(Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.
If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!
"Yeah!!! What is that? I mean isn't that sick. I mean , I'd be embarrassed to have that in my apartment."
I feel terrible. (Kramer smiling) I mean, Ive seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I cant go any further, but... Shes just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I cant breathe. Its like a drug.
A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!
So he just gets soup. He wants to save the meal. So now I got to do it all over again.
cool guy? what are you, in 8th grade?
George, I've been sick all week. Elaine was too. Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes. Do the math. Yeah, maybe I will get out. Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first. Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something. Yeah, Selwyn's. Okay bye.
Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so fuck(bleeped)ing good.
Oh, no, no, no, wait a second, wait a second th-th-that--
Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.
You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go 'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.'
You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.
Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated.
If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.
Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.
George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.
I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.
Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
What do you think the Nazis were doin? (Imitates the Nazis salute) That was the heil-five.
(getting looks from his parents) Not you. Older people.
C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.
Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.
Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.
Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...
I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.
Oh, about the... uh (Jerry pretend to wash his hands)
You see the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around, but they don't know they're ugly, because nobody actually tells them.
It was just an innocent comment! I didnt know she had a pony!
So, Puddy, I decided Im gonna go with another 900 convertible.
So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?
Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other?
Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to begin with! Let's face it. I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's that!
No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch)
Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in big, big trouble.
Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!
I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.
Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.
This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.
But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.
Ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.
That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?
Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched voice) Gone.
I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.
Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents.
Well you might as well look it over.
I thought we were going to the movies?
Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.
The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be?
Cheque. Now, the fact is, if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, yknow, cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they dont know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster (Jerry draws imaginary book from a holster.) Who do I make it out to? Theres my ID. Theres something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I dont know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, I dont have any money, but if youll contact these people, Im sure theyll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I dont have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?
(to the phone) Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my moneys gone... Well, call me right back. (Jerry hangs up.) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasnt been home or in his office in the past three days!
(pause) If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?
Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.
"I don't know how you can eat that spicy chicken,"
That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in it's path.
Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?
Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-
I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.
That's the last babka. They got the last babka.
"Of course.... But that's got nothing to do with it."
The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.
(Nodding, trying it out) "I'm there for you."
Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
(disoriented) How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?
Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.
Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!
Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)
Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model.
. Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it
Would you excuse me a minute? Im gonna go to the bathroom. Ill be right back.
I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?
What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers.
(Pointing out) It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for "Avast ye matey" - what the hell does that mean?! "20 degrees off the starboard side - the Spanish Galleon!" - there's no comeback for that!
Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya doing?
No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. Maybe we should ask him.
Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.
(putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to Sopie's) Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship.
Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?
Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.
I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.
No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble..
Elaine? What does she have to - (notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.) Oh no...
Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)
He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.
I would like to propose a toast....Wait a second.. George! George Costanza come in here.
Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.
Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)
I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)
All right, the whole elevator business, let me just explain-
I was kind of um (pauses) making out.
I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go "Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!"
Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em.
(Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.
Where do you suppose that could've come from?
Right. For the reducing of the pond scum?
I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it.
No, Elaines got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and hes suppose to do it.
All right, she said she couldnt find a decent hotel room...
I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.
(Joking around) Hey, didn't I beat you up in the fourth grade?
Great, its yours. I can't stand the sight of it. Elaine, heres the car keys. (tosses her the keys)
If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like Lex Luthor.
George used up all my guest passes already.
No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?
Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.
How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable special . I 've never gotten a cable special.....well that's it I'm not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado. (to the silent Kramer on the couch beside him) ...Exactly.
Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?
I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight....
(Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing?
He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly . I would like to have a good show.
Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!
Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?
All right, bye. (to Elaine) You see this? Any thought pops into their head they're calling me because it's a local call now.
I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around..
Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.
I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.
Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything.
Wait a second. (Grabs the icebucket off the counter.) This'll scare 'em off. (Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. Jerry gets back into bed.) Well, good night, Ollie.
I dunno , I'm gonna ask Shelley ,but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident.
Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?
Really? (They start to make out, Jerry sees the pilot on the plane) Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!
Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!
Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs.
I tell ya, I don't see it happening.
But you yada yada'd over the best part.
That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.
So it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato.
I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.
It's been known to happen....... telling you right now Elaine, this guy 's gonna dangle that dress in front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule.
No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.
No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.
What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police dont use them for, you know, crowd control. (Jerry crouches down, and makes like hes riding a pony.) Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, Im talking to you. Behind the barricades! So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldnt it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... Baltic, thats two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, thats it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.
(Singing) Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!
The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?
Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that "Miss Congeniality" on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going? (Kramer enters.) Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey, what are you doing tonight?
I am not gonna taste your peach. I ate some one's pecan last night, I'm not gonna eat your peach.
By the way, just for the record -
What are you doing? Were going out to dinner in ten minutes.
No no no, dont interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what its doing. Just let it finish.
Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.
(Pointing) He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..
Kramer, they're fumigating. There's toxic gas in there.
Okay, fine. (Jerry takes a coin from his pocket.) This is the official flip. No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and thats it. Agreed?
Inka-dink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink.
C'mon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine)
Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.
402? (Checks his wristwatch) Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup!
"Guys And Dolls"? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?
(reading on) "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-"
SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?
No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?
No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.
(applying paste to brush) Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?
I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.
No, no. Still doin the big sweep across.
I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?
I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" thing.
I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.
I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect.
I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to Jack)
Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.
I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.
What are you gonna do about the roommate?
I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.
Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?
By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine)
My stomach, I , think it was that cookie.
Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll *all* be over...
Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.
All of a sudden it hit me, I realized what the problem is; I can't be with someone like me.. I hate myself!! If anything I need to get the exact opposite of me....It's too much. It's too Much I can't take it ...I can't take it!!!
Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?
I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation. The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?"
Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations.
oh uh nothing, she just.. choked on a jujube
Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?
There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.
Alright, alright. Uh, undo them. I'll help you get them off.
How long has your car been sitting in the Yankee parking lot?
(Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the 80s, and its still relatable today.
Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee)
(on the phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second. (George walks in  Jerry asks George) So we definitely dont want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes his head NO) Alright, were back together again, great. Bye bye.
(still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.
Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?
She'll have a cup of coffee and a broiled chicken.
So you say she was on a horse?
The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?
So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought.... And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me.
I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didnt want to talk to, I could go, Excuse me, Im not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away. I also have a cordless phone, but I dont like that as much, because you cant slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone  You cant talk to me like that! Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone  You cant talk to me like that!
Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.
The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.
All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm away, gets phone) now... the failsafe. The wake-up guy... (dials)
(Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.
You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.
Uhm, hold, hold on a second. (pauses counting) I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.
I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. (Lena is puzzled.)
No you can't. (hangs up the phone) Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?
I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.
(Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!
(Pulls a small bottle out of his pocket) Uh-huh. Hey, look what they had on the plane. Schnapps.
Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.
Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you.
Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves, wanted to come home and start working on his floor.
First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.
At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.
I never heard anybody curse in a toast.
All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you.
Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
Ugh, the four worst words in the English language.
That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.
(cont) and this whole justice league, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman. You mean to tell me Superman can't cover everything?
You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding.
No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.
What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. (acts like he did in the movie) Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. (does the next look) I mean, beyond that, Im risking a punch in the mouth. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?
Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...
I don't mind at all. Why should I mind? What did he say?
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.
What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I dont even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. Thats what I want. I want an admission of guilt.
(Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them!
Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.
A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business.
Well it?s very flattering. How did you get these tickets, I heard they're impossible to get.
You know, I really need to use the bathroom.
All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.
The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.
Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a person could still make a mistake like that.
You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?
I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.
Yes it is. I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior.
So I dont know what shes using it for.
Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't do you favors after you dump them.
I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.
You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events.
The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.
Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket.
You know, Kramer's gonna clean up on this place.
Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!
I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?
(Joking around) I think it's the stench of death.
(Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?
I mean all that stuff is so small.. ((ELAINE is wryly assessing him)) stupid..
They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read. I was wondering if-
Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.
A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.
Im getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other line beeps) Im getting another call, see ya(answers call) Hello!
What should I do, should I call the police?
Oh! There coming to town tomorrow by the way.
What you do say about a guy like this, huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. But your loyalty is beyond question.
I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.
Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend. (puts his arm around Elaine's shoulder, but she shrugs it off twice)
(in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.
Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be? (Elaine laughs - hu) Why can't you live?
Well, your day's getting more interesting already. (Jerry shows the phone) Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.
So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?
Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie "Cinderfella". I got 'em at an auction.
(reluctant) Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too.
My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.
Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order)
Hey, hey, what are you doing, that?s my quarter.
No, its, its just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it. (Jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) Ten-fifteen... No, dont be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, its no trouble at all... Ill see you tomorrow... Great, bye. (He hangs up the phone; to Kessler) I dont believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here!
That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus?
Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?
What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. "I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other people. You won't be around me. But you will be around." "Take care now." Did you ever say that to somebody? "Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now." "Take care. Take care." What does this mean? "Take off!" Isn't that what you really want to say? "Take off now."
How could you eat fish on a plane?
Why do I have to go on the tour?
(more disgusted) Ohhhh! You cant! Its impossible! Theres no break in the conversation where you can go, All right then... You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.
(still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?
Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude.
Make sure you get this area here, where he needs the help....
Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.
(to George) Snow. Snow, that cant be good for suede, can it?
(quietly) Hey, uh, Milos, I don't mind rolling over here, but could you lighten up on the 'not a man' stuff?
Oh! Come om . He'll be over there for a half hour, he gets lost over there. C'mon so what is this about?
Girls. There's girls right here in the store. Look, look, there's one over there. Look, there's another one. Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there. What's the matter?
Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.
But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!
They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.
Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.
Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?
Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it.
Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.
You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're lifting heavy suit cases.
(Opens the door) C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? (Starts jiggling his keys - as if he's calling out for a dog) Huh? C'mon! C'mon!
What do you say to a person like you?
We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.
Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?
Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it.
Where did I take it? Where Did I Take It? (stabbing a knife into a cutting board) Umm, to that place on, uh Columbus and 85th. Okay?
Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.
I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.
Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...
Yours?....You know what I'll think I'll brush later.
In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him)
No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me. She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised what's going on.
(taking off his jacket) Slaughtered. Wiped the floor with 'em and (hanging up jacket) not only that, the money was unbelievable.
Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, that's it. They go to the next show.
I know. He got the hit in game SIX. So, so then what happened?
And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.
(explaining) I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.
Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.
No I can't she didn't leave her name or number.
I love these nature shows, Ill watch and kind of nature show, and its amazing how you can always relate, to whatever theyre talking about. You know like youre watching the African Dung Beetle and youre going Boy, his life is a lot like mine. And you always root for whichever animal is the star of the show that week -- like if its the antelope, and theres a lion chasing the antelope you go, Run antelope Run! Use your Speed, Get away! But the next week its the lion, and then you go Get the antelope, eat him, bite his head! -- Trap him, dont let him use his speed!
Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.
I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room, searching for the TV.) ELAINE!
Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.
Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me...
Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead.
(To Assistant) Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.
Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with you?
Yeah, and youre just what shes looking for too  a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.
Oh, its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.
Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?
Id rather not say it out loud. Its embarrassing.
Not that I would think of doing such things.
I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.
No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.
(to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?
No, I kinda tried to test his hearing.
This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.
Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.
It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it.
Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!
Well thank you very much, it's about time.
I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha ha!
I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.
Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?
I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)
So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.
Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?
We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.
No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out.
Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!
Yeah. (subdued) I don't think this is the jacket.
All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! Just wait here and I'll get it for you. ... Kramer this is Tia.
No, believe me it's not good. I'll mail you a new one with something really funny written on it.
So get this we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.
So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out (as mortician) 'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'. (as Mrs Costanza, horrified) Aahh!
Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???
How can I want it now, if you want it?
Oh, The Muted Heart. Glen Close. Sally Field. Well, that should be good.
All fathers are intimidating. Theyre intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, To hell with the world, I can make my own people. Ill eat whatever I want, Ill wear whatever I want, and Ill create whoever I want.
(writing) Here's my address and number. And really, thanks again.
(imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape?
Look, its a very awkward situation. I dont wanna be presumptuous.
Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?
No, absolutely nothing. (They get up to leave) You're fantastic! (They meet up with Kramer and George on the way out) Hey guys!
Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.
No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy.
Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.
What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.
You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. Hmmm. What do you want?
I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.
Well we went out one time. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.
Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.
(Reads the pill bottle) What kind of pills are these, anyways?! "For Smuckers"? "May cause panting and loss of fur"? (Turns to Kramer) These are dog pills!
I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.
Pull over? The lieutenant is waiting to see us.
Kramer! (We hear Kramer's door slam open and shut. Kramer enters. Jerry comes out of his room.) Hey! Where's all my sneakers?
Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?
uh uh because then it would be all grown up.
Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?
He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes.
No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy.
Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip.
Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought.
She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.
Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.
She went out to get her head shaved.
I mean it's a terrible mistake, I mean he thinks I ruined some deal of his at NBC, I don't know anything about any deal at NBC.
So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?
(very disinterested) Hum... ok, what else you got?
Well, you want your organizer back don't you?
You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us.
Non-fat yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it.
Yeah. I want that coat. (Jerry opens his wallet, looking for the dry-cleaning ticket)
(barring the way) I'm sorry. I-I don't know you.
Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. (To Kramer) I never should have cashed those checks!
I don't know. I just feel he should call me.
Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.
Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, "Make sure you hang on to your jacket."
(calmly getting up with plate of chicken) Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, (drops chicken into sink) was, for two.
All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.
No, I think I would have remembered Memma.
So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.
Im not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want.
Oh, were meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building.
(Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah?
(walking out) Thanks for having me over, guys.
That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.
Yeah, yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. Would you mind. I'd like to take the picture back.
He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.
Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.
Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.
(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll never get another date with her. She'll freak out.
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
(Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.
Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!
I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.
She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence
(agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!
Well if he's going then I'm not going.
Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.
(to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?
I thought you were going out with Celia?
(a la "Don Corleone") Never go against the family, Elaine.
Lean your head back. Open your mouth! (Grabs Kramer's head) Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!
No. We both just saw the same monkey.
He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?
Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.
George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?
So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City. I'm performing at Bally's.
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you dont have to be home on time.
Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.
Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!
The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.
Youre already moping! Would you take the place?
Well, I have some money. What do you need? (pulls out some bills)
Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give it back to me.
I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
(Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.
Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.
Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.
Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.
Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. (pause) Did you?
Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.
Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. (indicating) Come on in. You got the cigars?
So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?
I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.
Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!
Is it...? Could it...? Could he have...? IT IS! (Grabs Kramer.) Poppie peed on my sofa!!
Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?
So, you wanna come up for a few minutes?
(pulling on a jacket) They had a cancellation and they instantly called me.
I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there.
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.
. . . All right (gritting teeth) Just give me the ticket.
Well you said they could come and take the records.
You know, I think he wears a piece.
(thinking) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft... (to Vanessa) Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit.
You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?
Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio.
So what did you do there all day?
Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . What could he do?
A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?
Theres the giant ball of oil. Clares right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!
I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.
So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.
Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.
Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.
Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?
Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!
Whats to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.
What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him? I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he?
(into phone) Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. (to George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.
No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?
Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.
And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She says, "That's funny." ... That's funny!
You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.
You faked it? Why would you do that?
Right in front of me!. How do you know we're not together. Two guys, sittin' laughin' drinking Champagne Coolies.
Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.
Just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces Kramer) Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!
I live in New York. (slams the cab door) What the hell happened?
Thats what you want to see, yeah. . . . Yeah, you want to trade your hair for some phlegm.
Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.
(pointing at the operation he mouths the words) Did it go in?
Hello. Didn't I see you at the pro shop yesterday?
(seeing that Kramer has a new watch) What's that?
It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.
We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie.
Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?
My honest opinion, I think she made it up.
Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off that sign?
You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this jockey and the jockey got off the horse and started chasin' him.
(accusing) You're not wearing a shirt, are you?
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.
You got a little shmootz there (picks something on her sweater)
I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.
What are you so worried about this for?
Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer.
"I don't know but I was spitting out and rinsing like there was no tomorrow."
Well, it has nothing to do with you.
Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this uh considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check?
(Still pulling on Kramer's pants from the ankles) Man these are tight. (Yanking) Squinch your hips in
I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?
Yeah, theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.
(Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat.
It's been three days and he hasn't called.
I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no.
Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again.
Thats comforting. Shh. Hes coming. (to Ray) Ray?
We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy.
Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!
Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful.
Since when are you treating me to medicine? What are you doing? You're stealing this, aren't you?
(downcast) No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?
So you lie! What did you tell her?
What? (Kramer hands Jerry an envelope) My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it?
I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!
Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.
You like the couch? Ill tell you what Im gonna do.
I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?
Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.
It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
Can I make it up to you? Ill give you fifty bucks for the jug.
Why didn't you just ask her for it?
(Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.
I never shouldve gotten involved in this. Im a nervous wreck. Im not cut out for investing.
You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story??
Yeah, Im going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days.
(still in tuxedo, tie undone) Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.
I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.
So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?
So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.
Good luck, It's sold out for the next three weeks.
The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.
Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!
All right, all right. Whats the big hubbub, bub?
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman anything you say she does!
Schumann. (George stops himself, frightened. Jerry looks around the lobby.) Where are they?
We didnt bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.
I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting.
Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.
Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.
Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--
Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.
Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction.
Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes.
(Chuckles) You don't know the half of it.
Hey, ??? is rerunning the Yankee game. You watching this?
Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
Oh right, the new job, how is it?
I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble. I'll do it myself.
Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?
I know exactly whats gonna happen tonight. Im gonna try and act like Im not impressed, hes gonna see right through it.
We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.
You're cut off, you're out of the loop!
Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles...
Yep. Since college. (Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.) Hey, Lena Small's on this list.
You know, Gary (slams shut the door) I had a little chat with George the other day...
Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.
Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!
Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.
Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.
Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?
You guys both have class at the same time?
Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.
So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you this thing was good!
(seeing Elaine enter Monk's) Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body?
And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus
First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, "Didn't you see my signal?" "Look at that fender!" ..Then you'd see a real fight.
No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.
Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand and put it on his shoulder)
Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!
(cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You havent been out of the building in ten years!
Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here...
(Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?
What happened to the jacket. Did he take it with him?
Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket.
Fine all done, just looking for the soap.
Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.
Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.
Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.
No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage?
He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?
(finding Frankie, in his hole) Frankie... come on out of there.
Hello. Oh! Hi George.......What! ..really! All right I'll call Elaine , we'll meet you down there.
All right. That's it, I can't work like this.
I was hoping you'd offer. (The intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---
Why don't you go to another nail shop?
Doesnt matter. Whats the young mans name? I would like to meet him.
Anyway, you know why I didnt ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab.
This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!
(Nauseated at the saying) Would you please stop saying that?!
Whats the difference?! Thats the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!
It's like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action.
Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?
Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?
Have you ever spent any time with these people...?
Hey, I've been back four days, I want my mail.
(Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?
Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.
(Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?
I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back.
They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again.
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?
(noticing a coffee table book) Oh, you got the Civil War book. I saw some of that show, it was wonderful.
What do you mean? Why wouldn't I know his name?
so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?
I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...
You're out of your mind you know that.
That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?
I never should have made up those rules.
So you just pretended it didnt bother you?
I cant believe it! This guy ripped me off!
Well how did he react when you gave it to him?
Oh, well here. Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it again.
She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.
Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what youre talking about, now, come on, come with me. (stands up) I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.
It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.
Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do?
Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.
Its a list of excuses, its for that guy, Horneck, whos at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I dont have to see him. (Elaine laughs.) I need it. (Elaine starts writing on the list.) What are you doing?
I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!
(Once again, the audience hears his thoughts) I'm so car sick. I'm gonna vomit!
Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.
Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex.
Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet.
I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!
Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it.
What's going on? You're the man of the hour, That's what's going on.
I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.
'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off the table.
What happened you didn't give her the papers?
(out of window) George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!
What I said. Ive been under a lot of stress.
Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to 'em. Mind if I walk through real quick?
Why dont they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, Just Back. All back; No front. You walk in the front, youre immediately in the back. (Jerry picks up a tie display, and shakes it rhythmically from left to right.) Look, Elaine, tie carwash.
Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.
Hey, look at the high score--"G.L.C." George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?
Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.
It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.
Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired.
Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?!
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang"...
No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.
Wait a second. .Just give me a second
It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.
And I don't want you to hold mine!
Come on, take them. You could take Bonnie.
Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.
(Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.
It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.
I don't know him. I know who he is.
(Sarcastic) Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.
(into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!
No, its okay now, that, that girl is not comin. Uh, I misread the whole thing.
(to George) That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.
Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.
I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.
Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.
(bewildered) Why would she try and kill you?
We won. Were in the finals on Wednesday.
You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.
This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.
No, really, I just got off the phone with him.
Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank.
Did you look at look at this picture carefully?
I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman.
See...women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel...
(to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?
You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.
Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?
No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.
(Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!
You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift.
No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's.
Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions.
The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)
Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.
(to the phone) Hello yeah yes it is really ah, ah Could you hold on a second? (to George and Kramer) Hey listen to this, some woman found an electronic organizer, my name was in it, she wants me to help her track down the owner.
I just hope that whole pony incident didnt put a damper on the trip.
Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for?
Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.
So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these types of people.
I don't know. What if I get caught?
All right. (goes into his hallway and comes back) You got my fins?
Oh. (notices a car being jacked up by a tow truck) Hey, isn't this Kramer's car? (yelling up) Hey, Cosmo!! They're towing your car!!
I dont bother with him. Hes been calling me for seven years. Ive never called him once! Hes got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if hes paying attention.
(livid) Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one!
Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour, then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night.
Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.
(Walks over and starts pulling on Kramer's pants) You just gotta wiggle your hips a little bit.
What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. (Hangs up)
Kramer!? (grabbing Kramer's arm roughly, pulling him back as he's about to knock)
A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning..
What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying...
Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why dont we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. (All three sit down) Now, look, you both find each other attractive, right?
Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?
Could you at least get a hat for me?
The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.
Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.
(long pause -- did he hear "ridicurous" -- should he say something -- can't decide if he should. Finally...) Did you say, "ridicurous"?
I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.
Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity. 5? 3? Oh, it was just an expression. All right, well, that's very sweet of you. Okay, I'll call you later. All right, bye. Hey!
No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it. (thinks out loud, opens phone book) Becker, ... Becker, ...
Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.
He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?
Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.
Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.
Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease?
Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.
I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.
(ironic outrage) The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!
Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?!
And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.
So I finally get to meet your pal Joey.
He asked me to. We were getting along.
Lemme just check my messages. (to himself) Maybe a nicer girl called.
I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?
Jim Fowler? The animal guy from "Wild Kingdom" is coming to your apartment?
Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?
Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention, Elaine laughs) Maybe it's time you got a different hobby.
No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first.
Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we play one for all the marbles?
(leafing through his mail) Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.
Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?
September 21st, first day of Autumn. Leaves changing colours.. Beautiful colors.
You want to go with me to NBC?
Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, You think?
Which part? The renovating the restaurant you dont own part or spending the two hundred million you dont have part?
Uh huh. Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?
What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display. (takes the peanut butter jar away from George)
Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there.
Ive been thinking about asking this girl Im, uh, seeing-
Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse.
Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.
Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this?
I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out.
(Kramer waddling out the door) Maybe you can soak in the tub.
Good evening, folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--
So what happened? You gave her my tax papers? ... My papers?
So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.
I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
No, no Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.
I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.
Sure. (points at booth) How about this one?
Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?
It's gotta have something to do with Kramer
Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)
What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.
Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.
Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
How could I know she would start to laugh?
Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you (throws the bottle to Kramer.)
(getting worked up) I don't need the money.
I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?
It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.
See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.
I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?
Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.
I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.
Over here. You can see right through here.
Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar!
Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?
(Like a little kid) But, I don't want to be a pirate!
well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.
Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, "Why knock my brains out?"
Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, "That's not a bad idea."
Yes. Yes I am! (to Helen) What else did she say on the phone?
Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.
So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show, I waited for you, you never came.
Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I dont feel comfortable in them.
They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same.
I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.
(thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And Ive still got another day! Ive got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. (to Vanessa) Thats a nice watch. Do you wind it?
Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.
Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts, so he killed him.
Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.
I cant blame you. I cant believe she never called you back.
What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him? 'Cos I asked him about the Knicks?
Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?
If I like their race, how can that be racist?... Hellooo??... Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!... Yyy-yes, I am calling George... Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!
Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''. And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. "Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''.
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer, say it isn't so.
Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- Zip, I'm gone. (makes a running motion with both arms and his right foot)
You know, I think I'll just take the check.
I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.
This is a person I like, its not How to score on spring break.
There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of... (he cracks) Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?!
Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just "recede into the night," if you know what I mean.
You what?! Get out! (pushes Kramer) Ten thousand?
Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.
I, I'm not happy with what I wrote.
Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.
She might be. She's the star of the show.
That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.
You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.
Yeah..... He caught me So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend to look at the coat.
Thats not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table repeatedly.) You know, maybe its not that bad an idea.
Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
You should have her work on it for you.
I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...
Well, I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble.
Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?
Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.
The Improv is playing "Rochelle Rochelle" The musical.
Yeah. (pointing at Elaine as he goes into the bedroom)
How 'bout if it was something like " I can't find my receipt my place's a stye.
Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.
Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school.
Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?
I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!
Y'know a lot of people have asked that...
(sound of gunfire) Pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, Pkeeew!
It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.
Keep following him Kramer. don't let me down.
Honey, what'd you do with the can opener?
Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.
Yeah, but why would you... (Kramer is eating a peach then disgusted he spits it out) Bad peach?
All right. Come on sit down. It's about to start.
(still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.
I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.
(reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.
Uh, THANKS! This is FUN! Yeah, this turned out to be a GREAT weekend.
Wow. Kenny Rogers Roasters. Finally open. Hey, look at the size of that neon chicken on the roof.
A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in The Blob.
No, I don't wanna see the naked people.
Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!
You know it and I ditched all my junk food.
But if you go back with me , then I'm not.
And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.
(To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?
Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop, clip clop. They're nuts for it.
NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.
Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I never know what to write on these things. I hate doin' this.
Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.
Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..
Hey Seth. Man it is coming down hard out there.
oh I though you didn't care about his looks
Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.
The uh toilet brush is under the sink.
And who is on the show? Who are the characters?
The main thing is to keep the line moving.
(opens the door for George) Where did you get that?
You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!
(Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?
I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going "I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?
All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.
Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.
(doubtful) I don't know, do you have a--
Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later.
(accusingly) Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.
YEAH? (speaking loudly so the visitor can hear him through the intercom)
But the question is, are you still master of your domain?
Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!
It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.
Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!
Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
(Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?
I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.
No more crutches, that must be a relief.
Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.
So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial?
What? (to George) What did, what did you say?
That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up. (phone rings) Excuse me one second.
All I said was I liked the pen!
Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please leave.
Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met!
Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.
I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer?
Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are?
You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.
He's got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, Jerry notices one of the movie goers) Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?
Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.
You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.
(Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla.
Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.
Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do?
I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?
You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.
Yeah, thats good. Hed clunk our heads together like Moe.
Hello,  oh hi Elaine .. what's going on  no he just left  you broke up with him?  ME TOO .. what happened?  oh smoking you know you're like going out with C. Everet Coope  me  nah  I couldn't go through with it  I just didn't feel ready  so what are you doing now?  Oh, great idea, I'll meet you there in like thirty minutes. Okay bye.
Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?
Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery.
What do you think it could've been just some dude?
All right lets go. We'll meet you back down here in ten minutes, hopefully with the money.
Thank you very much, that's great- >click< Oh! Hold on a sec, I got a call on the other line. >click click< Hello?
I'm not sure, but I think she was nice. (takes a sip of water)
Could you move your car back a little?
Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected, outwardly.
(under breath) Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..
No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.
(bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.
Oh. like they wouldn't have found that anyway.
Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again? (listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone. C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me. (hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello.
I don't get this. How did this happen. I don't have a dog.
You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...
What do I say if he picks up?
I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!
Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!
I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You know (does the motion for the check) Check, Check. Unless the waiter isn't too shape then you gotta total it up. Sometimes they come over, "Do you want the check?" No I wanna be pen pals, can't you see what I'm doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people.
(throws out his hands) What does he listen to? The all Desperado station?
Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?
Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,
I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... (Jerry stops, and mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica on the phone at work.)
Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--
It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
Suspected serial killer, he didn't actually do it.
What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I
What is this? What are we doing? What in god's name are we doing?
Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.
I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?
I sure do miss my apartment. Maybe I'll switch back.
Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut.
Y-You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set!
Fifty years they were married. Now hes moving to Pheonix.
Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though.
Come in for two minutes and sit with me.
(As George sits down) George, we need to talk.
I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...)
No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman.
What do you mean you don't think so?
The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..
Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.
Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess youre not going in anymore.
That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it. (throws watch in garbage)
You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.
Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you.
Alright, Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.)
Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.
(as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.
Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.
Yeah, uh, Ok, uh, tomorrow uh, where da ya - where do you live, uh, up town? Upper west side?
Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.
The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.
(walking away) Well, I didn't sleep with her.
Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What drives me to take chances like that?
(to George) No. (to Kramer) I told you not to say anything.
I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?!
Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome.
Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?
Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?
You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin them whenever I want!
Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.
How's life on the red planet? (shuts door)
Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye. (hangs up the phone; turns to Kramer) You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.
Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.
oh look at that I got oil all over me. Can I have your napkin?
All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?
So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?
Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up(?). Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.
I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
I'm saying "get the hell outta there"! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call, Jean-Paul! A wake-up call!
Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?
(sarcastically) Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.
(To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!
That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.
Go outside and see if he's still there.
Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.
I did. Im just curious. Its been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points? (to Vanessa) Its up six points!
It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.
Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series.
Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.
Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.
The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke. (The phone rings.) Thats probably Uncle Leo.
You're lying! You got it, I want that number!
I really think you're making too much of this.
Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?
I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.
A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!
Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.
Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.
It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.
Actually it's being taken care of right now.
You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do.
They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.
I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.
Shake is bad, but what if its the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?
She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?
I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!
That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.
So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything?
What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with. [To attendant] What is going on?
No! [throws her purse back at her] No, I mean, no thank you, nah...
(about the massage)You know I think this is really helping.
You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!
Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight. In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.
You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?
Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted.
What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage death match.
Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?
Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.
Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?
Oh, did you get that outta my bag?
Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.
Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really.
Elaine, see this T-shirt, six years I've had this T-shirt. It's my best one, I call him Golden Boy.
You're still trying to gget that free sub?
First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did.
(as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people.
I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high.
Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
You're going to make a good father someday.
I can't believe your a friend of mine.
Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist.
Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer, sitting on his lawn chair with a sparkler)
He was running from a bee. (Elaine laughs)
Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George.
I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.
(unenthusiastic) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) Im just, Im really glad youre here.
Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.
I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.
George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say,kookie talk.
"I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery."
OUR LIVES!! . What kind of lives are these? We're like children. We're not men.
We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.
I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!
Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.
You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?
No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.
I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (Jerry smiles. George laughs.) So, how's the book coming? (George's laughs taper off...) I say, how's the book comin'?
Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone? You wanted the machine. You know, and you're always kind of thrown off, (left hand up to side of face, pretending its a receiver) you go "Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you."
Oh...yeah...uh you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.
He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. He's a time slot hit.
Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?
Excuse me.( gets up and opens the door)
That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little off.
Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.
Of course I want to talk about it.
Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?
(reluctant) Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy.
(Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.
Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.
Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!
I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton.
You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.
All right now you listen and you listen good! (he grabs Kramer's legs and throws him down the couch)
(Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here.
Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?
Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people?
Y'know, I think I'll pass on the "Guys And Dolls"...
I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him.
Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. Im sure theyd just as soon give it to you, but youd have to come up with that money.
Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.
Well this is a great place to sit you got here.
Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity.
Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.
So George and I went up to NBC and we told them the idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract.
I dont wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do you think?
I don't know. Who could've been in my apartment.
(picking up his bag and coat) Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?
No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.
Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.
So youre sure youre not still angry about last night?
Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.
Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.
No economic reason for them to be here.
You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal.
I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something.
I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.
(still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)
And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!
Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.
Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?
Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
Im not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll em down below my knee?
I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?
So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here.
I said pull over by the stop sign.
I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?
All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.
Does it ever bother you that this organization-
All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...
I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.
He's been sleeping a lot. He's still groggy.
George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, ok...do we know where the 101 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 170 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 134 is? (George just looks at Jerry) No. Aha, ok. (Jerry hangs up) He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up.
By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks.
(derisively at Kramer) Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?
But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.
(leaving) You two keep an eye on each other?
Look, I gotta try and help the guy.
No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald cure.
Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that?
Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.
Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!
(Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!
Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because moneys a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you dont care about money when youre hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, youre like the ruler of an empire. More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives. Then after the meal, you know, youve got the pants open, youve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. Theyre mystified by the check. What is this? How could this be? They start passing it around the table, Does this look right to you? Were not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?
So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the Spokes model category?
Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.
(thinking; quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out.
It has nothing to do with whose house it is.
I cant believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.
So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new guy, in a big pot of love stew.
I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? Thats what I want to know. I mean, its the championship, Im hitting everything.
Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?
Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?
(Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script?
I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.
Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order.
So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head.
Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didnt like the looks of the defense and changed the play.
...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're there approving new clothes.....That's a girlfriend job! How dare he!!
You are. I can't get that thing in my car. (referring to George)
Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?
(looking over the list) Hmm ah. I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?
Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...
Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.
Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.
You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...
Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.
Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?
I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how theyre going to look at a thing like this.
Oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh that's terrific... Mulva.
(Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.
Pretty good. I think she might be the one.
Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.
No, but wait, wait And then you dump them off onto Kramer..
Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.
I can't go to sleep at nine o clock!
No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.
(answering machine) leave a message and I?ll call you back, thanks. JOE DIVOLA Jerry, Joe Divola. *Pbt* *Pbt* *Pbt* I have a hair on my tongue, I can't get it off, you know how much I hate that? Course you do, you put it there. I know what you said about me Seinfeld. I know you badmouthed me to the execs at NBC, put the kibosh on my deal. Now I?m gonna put the kibosh on you. You know I?ve kiboshed before, and I will kibosh again.
(Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.
You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
Where did you see that? Those are private!!!
Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.
George is pickin' us up at the airport.
That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.
(Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.
Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.
No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him.
I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.
(yell) Move to the back of the drawers!
Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?
Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more.
There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.
Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?
Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender! (an event guard stops them)
I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright*, I forgive you...
Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.
Well, at least have some reaction to it.
Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm alarge.
Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?
So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is better?
What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do whatever it is you do. You disgust me.
Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...
Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.
And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?
Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.
Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in.
(Stunned) No, keep it. (Elaine enters the apartment) Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.
(To Guard) I just wanted you to scare him.
Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?
So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry?
So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, hes thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, theres nothing left?
Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!
I'd be very interested in something like that.
Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!
I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!
I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home.
Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.
Why would he steal a box of raisins?
But thats what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. Theyre knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus.
Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and find my number.
I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.
No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.
All right, forget it, its over, Im not moving.
You dont think it mightve had anything to do with that?
You spent the night at James's? Did we?
You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!
Ah, don't worry. I made reser... (catches himself)
Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?
You know, instead, Im like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.
When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their face, you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going with somebody.
Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch?
He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.
Course you may not see it for twenty years.
Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?
Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!
No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!
Wouldnt it be great if you could ask a woman what shes thinking?
(thinking) I cant believe it. I got nothing! I dont even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...
oh you're afraid he might look like Zippy the pinhead
She's the model I met on the plane.
You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?
Oh, they're all the same. Here. [gives him Dust Buster] Now if you'll excuse us, ..
(removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?
I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!
No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.
[To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.
Ya. (hits the button, opens the door. To Elaine) Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys.
So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club.
Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George "Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again."
I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.
Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die.
Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!
So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?
No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.
(sarcastically) Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.
You are the Queen of Confrontation. Youre my new hero. In fact, youve inspired me. Im gonna call George about something right now.
No, I told you I admire your hearing.
(fidgets like he has no room with George next to him)... Could you move over there?!
Oh, alright ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....
I dont return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.
All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff.
By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?
Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.
I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. "The New Yorker is stealing my ideas." ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real.
You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.
What is this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesnt fit him).
(calls) Hey you two. Im ready to go.
You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.
Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail.
The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going "boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly."
You know 'm just curious, How did you know she wasn't my girlfriend?
Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.
I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?
Let me see that. (Jerry looks at the tag.) That is high.
So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?
I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
Well, I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.
This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!
Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.
All right, that's enough of that. (Jerry takes the plates and hands them to a waitress.)
I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?
Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.
So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
You got toilet paper on your heel there.
It's not that bright orange one is it?
Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?
Well, Im sure you did. Who wouldnt love a pony? Who wouldnt love a person that had a pony?
We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing.
Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.
I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.
Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?
Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?
(after Bookman exits) That is one tough monkey! (turns to Elaine) So you were saying?
I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes when someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within the gay community. They're probably discriminated against because of that, people say to them "Y'know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but I think think it's about time, y'know that you got in shape, tucked the shirt in and lost the wife". But if people are even going to assume that people that are neat are gay, maybe instead of doin' this, "Y'know I think Joe might be a little... [waves hand back and forth]", they should vacuum "Y'know I think Joe might be >vroom< [makes vacuuming motion]. Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little >vrooom<..."
Good idea. (phone's ringing, goes to it) (muttering) There's a beach towel on the rack.. (to phone) Yeah.
Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane enters)
The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.
Well, thats it. Look, Im going to Vermont. I dont want to think about this. Im selling.
This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.
You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?
Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.
Ya what was this? (HE IMITATES MOHEL'S FLINCHING)
Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.
Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.
I can't believe she threw out my napkin.
They sealed him up with the mint inside.
Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?
How would you know? You don't speak Korean.
Well what am I supposed to do now?
Hey is the same thing as hello. What do you think Jeannie.
Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up...
You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!
Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.
You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends....
Seth! Wow what has it been like five years?
What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?
He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. "I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"
Hey. So, ah, Ramon this is my friend Elaine.
I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.
(also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it.
(to Bania) Excuse me. (he goes back in the dressing room)
Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything. Why don't we all just go to Paris?
No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car.
(interrupts) I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.
Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?
Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.
So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.
You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.
(standing in the bathtub) Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.
Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.
I said I couldnt believe you liked that commercial. So what?
Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!
I know it's a big problem.. she puts like four pieces in her mouth, it's ridiculous, I don't think we're gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.
The female orgasm is kinda like the bat cave, very few people know where it is and if you're lucky enough to see it you probably don't know how you got there and you can't find your way back after you left. There are two types of female orgasms, the real and the fake. And uh I'll tell you right now, as a man, we don't know. We do not know, because to a man sex is like a car accident and determining the female orgasm is like being asked 'What did you see after the car went out of control?'. 'Uh I heard a lot of screeching sounds, uh I remember I was facing the wrong way at one point. And in the end my body was thrown clear.'
Someone says, Get out of my life, and that doesnt affect your appetite?
I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.
It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?
(TO GEORGE) Hey George, you ever see one?
Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph?
Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.
What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!
Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?
(Trying to explain) Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past.
hello. Oh, hi. What's happening?  what? oh um, sure,  um, yeah, okay, uh. I'll see you then. Yeah, yeah, Bye.
Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...
(to George) You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! It's crazy Joe Devola.
Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that.
Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.
Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.
We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? (turns to George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George?
oh I'm sorry I didn't get most of that.. isn't that Kramer over there?
You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.
Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.
The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting out that marriage.
Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off.
Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - theyre doing sign language now.
Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...
Ill have the, ah, turkey club without the bacon.
What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.
I got your message, (sitting) so I came straight from Atlantic City.
I really think the M&M should be you.
Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them.
What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?
Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this? (moves his arm) He's gonna think you're a mental patient.
(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.
No good. Too many people know the combination.
Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?
(holding up the '# DAD' shirt) We're even.
Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
Well, you know what they say. Lucky in love, Unlucky with fruit.
Vandelay Industries, Kel Varnsen speaking. May we help you? ... Oh Hi Keith. Na, I was just jokin' around
Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.
Well, uh, I uh, I dont want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe its not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.
(on phone) Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil.
But there's no "t" in your name. What about G-bone?
tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.
This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.
So, you would date a married guy? That's so hacky.
You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.
Im takin it, Im takin the place. Im gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. Im livin here...Im movin.
That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.
I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the "It's me" on the phone today.
Got it. (but now a man-hand grabs his arm) Uh!
Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.
Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions.
It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!
Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!
(adamant) No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back.
I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
(Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?
He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris.
Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side.
She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...
Well I thought we'd both be getting married.
I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.
That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?
You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe its Manage A Trois.
yeah without a doubt, I'm down (Kramer enters) oh hey how're you doing? Jane this is my neighbor Kramer
(Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.
Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.
Sex... to save the friendship. (Elaine drops her bag, takes off her jacket and walks into Jerry's bedroom) Well, if we have to (un-tucks his shirt) we have to.
No Elaine he's normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York.
(On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.
Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it!
Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.
Dont worry about it, it wasnt working anyway.
well, you know, sometimes a square is everything
Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.
What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog.
You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."
I think theres a mental hospital near here.
. . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?
It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.
Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.
You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?
You, sidle? Y-You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!
Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?
Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!
But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure.
Hey. So how was"Blame it on the Rain?"
He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.
(moving over to block the door) Where are you going?
Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?
And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises.
I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing.
Of course he did ..The guy's working ya.
Ma! Ma! MAAA! (Hangs up the phone in disgust.) Oh, ahhhh (sighs quietly)
Anyway, I don't need your help. (Turns to leave.)
(tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggage, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangements, but we can't seem to be friends when we sleep together.
All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!
Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?
I cant. Shell get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.
Coach to India - The only way to go.
Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.
He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.
(Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal.
Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?
An old friend of mine, whom you may have met, George Costanza, has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formally a highly placed official with an outfit known as the IRS. And as we speak, at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information. And she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise.
Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.
Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.
Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.
You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.
Ahh, too bad you got a little, George Costanza thing going on.
Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I?m the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me!
Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.
Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?
Because she's my wife! (The door buzzer sounds; Jerry answers it) Yeh?
I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.
And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.
(sharp) I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.
Yeah, killed. Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark.
No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.
(To Amy) Aha! So it's true! You were making out with him!
Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours.
Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.
hunky.. Tony.. hey hey hey (fools around with his collar again)
You asked a date to go to the operation?
What would you say if I told you that...
I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.
(doubtful) Yeah, you'll make it up to me.
Yea. (pulls at the t-shirt) This is Golden Boy's son Baby Blue.
You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem.
I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator...
Uh, again? (Limping towards the door) I'll be right there.
It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?
(Gesturing to Ellen) Kramer, George, this is Ellen.
Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason.
Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?
Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.
I don't know Kramer, ahh, my concern is that ....
It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
(To George) You're givin' him back that TV.
Have you thought any more about that trip?
Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?
I thought you just said she doesn't know??
...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry.
Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.
Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?
I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles.
(to George) All right, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend Im disappointed. Youre going to really see me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this. Maybe you should go in the other room.
(Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.
I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.
(thinking) Thank you, Pamela! (turns to talk to Vanessa; to Vanessa) So, youre a lawyer...
Shes limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.
We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! Well be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life.
I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.
In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?
Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.
(picks up phone) Hello? (listens) Oh, hi Mr. Pitt.
Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office
(sarcasm) Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.
Dont you think she woulda heard I was there?
Where have you been? You know, you're on next.
(outraged) He's a doctor!.I mean it's supposed to be like a sterile environment."
No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking.
Oh, Okay (turns to rest of table) Im sorry, I didnt know what to bring, nobody told me.
I have an idea. (Elaine enters; to Elaine) We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three.
Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.
Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine.
(To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. (Gestures to a black Saab)
That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.
Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?
People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression 'The best revenge is living well' I've said this, in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice, doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him, 'Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting, french doors, a divan. That'll show those punks.'
Oh, like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping carts with one bad wheel?
The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?
Kind of in the middle of something here, George.
Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said "Too bad he's gay".
They guy's in my house right now. What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.
No, its not you. Its your stomach, hes taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-
Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
Ma, you cant look up words in the dictionary! (to Morty) Dad, shes cheating!
Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.
That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact.
(struggling to open a bottle with his bandaged finger) I can't do it. (A LA GODFATHER) Look what they did to my boy, They massacred my boy.
There you go. That'll get you home in time.
Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!
You got a lot to learn about pancakes.
Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship.
Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?
Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!
Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?
He never heard of corduroy! True story, true story.
Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you.
Come on. Then you dont have to see him again til my 15,000-mile check.
I'm sorry. Got any booze? What's say you and I get ripped!
[rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your point!
Oh! my god. What the hell is this? ..... Don't tell me.......Velvet!!!
And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.
He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.
Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, (looking at the TV) Kramer, turn that up.
What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead.
Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?
Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, that?s not fair, what about George, Susan and Elaine, what do you need me for?
Oh no! >click click< Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!
A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?
You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? When I'm on stage that's all I hear; You stink, You suck. We like magic.
Sure, Beth, these things happen. (Brief pause) So, have you told many.. people yet?
And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my...
How long did you leave it up there?
People dont turn down money. Its what separates us from the animals.
Look, youre a nice guy, its just that... we dont have anything in common.
Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)
Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer.
I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.
I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, its very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, Call the police. You really should call the police. So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, Yeah, Im calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... Im gonna see some real action. Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out The Report. They give you Your Copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I dont really think were gonna crack this case, do you? Its not like Batman, where theres three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up, hes dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him, hes a PENGUIN!
All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! (Audience boos)
(Like an Army general) Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys.
You don't think she's just talking to me?
Really? How come you never pursued her before?
No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura opens the door and gets out). What? What?
To a guy you've never met? (mild sarcasm) Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous.
Especially when you got a layover in Sarajevo. (Bosnia Herzegovina)
What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.
Well I started screaming, "There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina." Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running (In the background -- CLERKS VOICE 57) and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.
(yelling) Yes I told him the Packyderm story!
I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need "the clown" in his title, as clown? Bozo, "the" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...
So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?
You'll be out before we get the check.
Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.
I hear you're going out with David Putty.
The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.
All right, what are you gonna say to him?
(TO KRAMER, REBOX) Will you let me help you with that?
And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.
I think thats the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!
Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?
We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?
Hold it. Broccoli? Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce.
I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.
to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?
Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.
I mean that's fine if that's who you are...
You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.
Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show.
They did it for three years. What's another few months.
Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?
What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.
How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? Wha, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just sit there going, "Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh, no, another headcase!"
Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?
Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line.
Hmm. So you feel "women and children first," in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.
Get a march goin'! March it! (She exits)
wait, where are you going? where are you going?
Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.
Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.)
Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women.
Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!
Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're puttin' it in my box now.
We found out his super power was lack of money.
I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper of the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack . . .
Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie.
Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before.
Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?
You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back.
No, but he's not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR)
Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't get any oxygen.
Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere.
You did not tell me not to sell.
So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought ... What a coincidence. We're just about to eat.
(Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) I didn't say anything.
No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.
Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time.
Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.
Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?
George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods)
You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.
Really? Did you hear that? Somebody else was killed!
Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of deadbeats.
Quone? No, Im afraid that Im going to have to challenge that.
No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?
How could she not tell me where she was staying?
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??... Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women!
Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place.
I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.
Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?
Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally!
(Stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. (Approaches the intercom) C'mon, let's get it together.. (Through intercom) Yeah?
"You find you need to use a lot of obscenities at the dentist.
Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.
What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must be something. What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks?
I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?
You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.)
Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.
How much could you possibly have in there?
Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?
What was I supposed to do? You knew I was on my first date with Elaine. You come barging in here asking me to contribute money for a volcano relief fund for krakatoa.
You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...
SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya! (the inter- com buzzes) Yeah?
While you were in jail. So you're free.
You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.
Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!
No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.
I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! **
Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.
(Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.
Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.
I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.
Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'
A few stitches? I've never had stitches. I'll be deformed. I can't live with that. It goes against my whole personality. It's not me!
Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?
(sits on the back of the couch) Oh my god.
When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.
Hum, well it all comes as news to me.
(picking up the phone and dialing) It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.
Elaine got a new number because she died.
Hey listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, why don't you have dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if you want, you know, have a little company, take the pressure off.
Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.
But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship.
Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner
Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something.
Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too.
Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle...
Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.
Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.
It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.
Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign.
And who were you tryin to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?
I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.
And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table)
He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man that's some tart cider!
No, no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts.
There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.
Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry.
(Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.
My car? You drove it into the swamp!
I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.
(Resisting) Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I-I can't wear this!
Great. One of the best jobs I ever had.
(Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.
You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.
Let's go out and celebrate! (they all get up)
(Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..
Ohh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands. So.. (Goes for his coat)
Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?
Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off.
(pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?
Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.
And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.
Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.
What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him, I dont think were right for each other. Hes a guy! At least with a woman, theres a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.
(on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV for another minute) The letter, that's the letter!
I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.
Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you.
I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce you get impeached and you're not even the president!
Excuse me. (Gets up and answers the door.) Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!
Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I?m serious, I?m not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.
(Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.
You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.
George! Can we focus on the car, here?
(stares at George, incredulous) "Back on"? What was it doing off?
Hey look, there's a spot right in front.
You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.
August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress! She never changes! Oh my god. (looking around) She's gotta have hundreds of these dresses.
If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber.
Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is who's responsible for this?
I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down. (To Elaine) What?
You what? You passed? How could you do that?
C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one.
Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.
Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?
Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out?
All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape.
Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
(to Elaine) So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?
Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.
I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation.
We dont understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you cant stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I dont see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, lets make up our mind where we think theyre going.
Well, it was the best of those movies.
You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy.
So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?
Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
(finishing) The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.
And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.
But you did actually throw his coat out the window.
I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?
That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.
(flips a roll of paper towels in the air) Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.
Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money..
Hello Elaine? Patty Lawrence had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?
(to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?
(Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.
Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday?
Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks.
Nope, the cop says its my word against his. Theres nothing they can do.
Okay, okay. Forget it. Its okay. I didnt mean it.
Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?
Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get in touch with you.
(walking out) Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody.
No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.
(Thinking) What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship. Gotta relax.
Never. (The elevator door opens.) Wait a second. Thats her. On the right.
Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.
And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?
There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a "Smell Gestapo". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush...
(continuing to pack) That's a nice four seconds.
It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman.
Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up.
Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So...
Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys.
Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless.
Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
Because you were too busy stealing a book.
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?
That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?
who do you think she is? how dare she? you want me to get the manager? too bad they don't have those old ladies walking around with flashlights anymore we'd flush her out
Coincidence? This guys in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment?
Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.
What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp, why do you want shade?
No!!! The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him, you break his spirit!
Dont worry. (whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!... Its Jerry!... Jerry!... From next door!... Never mind where I am!... Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!...
(Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there.
Elaine, he's a.. he's a male bimbo, he's a mimbo
Yeah, I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her.
Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.
Yeah, its some place down in the village.
I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.
Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something.
(examining) Hey George, you know what? I think this crest is different. It's got a moose on it.
Hi. Hi. Look, I don't know what you think --
All right, all right. All right, thats enough! Lets get back to my deal. That undercoating, thats a rip-off, isnt it, David?
(walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!
(reading) 'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie, hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'
All right, I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else.
Hes a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.
Understand you had a little talk with him too.
I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.
So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?
(cutting in) I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman.
And that waist cincher, that was the topper!
Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.)
Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.
Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?
Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing and
Yes, so people are just dialing it by mistake and getting you.
Yeah but theres a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet.
(Unsure of what to say - he remember's Leo's courtesy tip) Hello?
After one date you try and improvise on her machine?
Well, look at this guy. Look, hes got everything, hes got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners.  This is not his first load.
It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.
to himself Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.
You know, we never had one fight before this deal.
Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.
Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!
(To George, in a 'cha-ching!' motion) Vermont! (To Ellen) With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to! (George is disturbed. He gets up, goes go Kramer's door, and knocks. They talk) Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I can't wait.. buy-bye. (Hangs up. George and Kramer come into Jerry's apartment, confronting him) What? (George takes the phone off the hook) What is this?
All right. (picks up the alarm clock) Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 650... volume check. (music playing, he starts swinging) What kinda music you wanna wake up to? Top 40, classical...
Alright, but let me ask you this question.
Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?
You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.
Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that.
I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me "C'mon Jerry, go along, go along..."
It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.
And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.
You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
(proud of himself) Remember me? I said I 'd come back with someone and I did. Surprised?.
Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, "Photographs - Do not bend".
No, no, no, it's... "She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her."
(Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My, isn't this an awkward moment?
I don't even know what you're talking about.
The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what youre doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? We have soda, we have soda, we have soda, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. Its a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and youre watching TV and youre drinking the exact same product that theyre advertising right there on TV, and its like, you know, theyre spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and Im standing there, Maybe Im putting too much ice in mine.
I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.
1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass!
(to Mickey) Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?
(to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?
Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen?
You're really going to town with that turkey there.
Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?
I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem.
Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)
Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed like ten new minutes.
Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.
Yea, ya, so...anyway what was I talking about.
Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... what kind of a sicko would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide (small fingers opening imaginary drawers) Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT hard to get round black buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this? ... is it such a great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, you'll never find them - they save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they're going to fall off too that's the other thing ...
Yeah, yeah. Sometimes shes on time, and... sometimes shes late.
Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! (Kramer is speechless) I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet.
Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.
You know I can't get this *damn thing* to sleep. (about the Yo-Yo)
Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!
And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.
I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldnt do that.
Yknow I think that even if youve had a relationship with someone, or lets say, especially if youve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, its very difficult. Isnt this? Its hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. Its like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, Look, a rabbit. The other goes, So? I believe this is your card. Look, why dont we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?
But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.
Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.
What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's - it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it, and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you. (Nodding)
They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?
It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library
(Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.
Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.
No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.
I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?
Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerrys office. (Elaine is looking confused). Were going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean hes already left?
You really used to have a think full head of hair.
It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?
Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.
Wow! Hey, theres Clare. I better go down.
Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!
I'm not letting you cheat, Newman. You're not getting anywhere near that board.
All right! I'll do it. The race is on.
"Naaaaaa...I can't watch a man sing a song."
"So what about the Penthouse. Did you ask him?"
I have no patience for lactose. And I wont stand for it. Um, Ill be right back.
... I think. Have some more wine. (Jerry pours his whole glass of wine into her glass.)
(checking his watch) I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
So what are you going to do with the mattress?
It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.
Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. (Joel shakes his head agreeing; Jerry smiles) You know, its their annual terrorist luncheon.
That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?
You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!
You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.
Sample? (under his breath) Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book.
So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you.
Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.
Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!
Ill call Kramer. He can check my house.
That orange dress is burned in my memory
Great, I had fun. Wheres the TV, wheres the VCR?
Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!
Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.
Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.
That's the way they do it in Vegas.
Kramer , there's no way you're sleeping with me.
There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.
Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?
You know what? No champagne. Anyway. . . I'll see you later.
The old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go "how do you like crotch?" If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly.
She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
(to the Barneys sales associate) Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?
Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... (to himself, cursing her) Mulva!
You know, the water pressures terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower.
But they not you arent handicapped, arent you ashamed?
Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.
No, nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table)
Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing?
Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?
(CONT'D) What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.
Oh, the sisters (he sits at the table)
Oh, o.k. (Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.)
Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.
So, she got you to join a book club?
Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy.
(Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine?
Course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.
I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.
(looking outside) Hey Newman, is that your red car?
Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.
I thought youre like Hitler in the bunker?
O.K. from now on I want you to call me "Jerry the Great".
(Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?
(turning to each other) I dont know. Hes an importer.
Well we're sitting here together. Why wouldn't you think that.
Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. (pointing at the umbrellas) What've you got in a push-button mini.
What're you doing? I thought you were changing.
Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much for so long.
What, are you serious...why, why did she call?
I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person.
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.
And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.
No, I tried it on. It fits good.
There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.
Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?
You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em.
Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!
and that's why you're going out with him
Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits on a couch.) Hey, what about this one?
Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.
(to the Drake) Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. (To Elaine) Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?
Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years.
(While digging in his pocket for some money, he looks over the shirts one last time) You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt..
Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone to ghost read it.
What do you think the worst part of being blind is?
I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.
More cereal? that's your third bowl today, you had it for breakfast and lunch.
Is that guy still there? (They are side-on to Phil who is in the background, still pressed against the glass, aghast)
All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.
(thinking to himself; picks up a tube) "Fungicide". Fungus?
Cops eating Milanos. What crazy town is this?
This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.
You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars.
Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives. (Picks up phone and dials) Hello Tim? Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you? Well it turns out I can use them. Oh, you do? I understand. Okay. Bye. He already made plans, he can't change them.
Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?
Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?
Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.
Well, what do you think the big holdup is?
Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?
(frustrated, to self) The whole system is breakin' down!
youre a real pleasure. (Jerry is being sarcastic)
Boy, It's the way they just slip it in there too.
So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out Im giving you a raise.
Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.
Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.
Well ... ok, I guess (voice trailing off)
(While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands him a nickel)
That was our babka. We had that babka!
What if hes in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (Jerry knocks on imaginary glass.) How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? (He makes a hissing sound.) By the way, whats happening with Sendrax?
Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.
Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)
I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?
You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.
No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I dont know her name.
Well, good night [holds hand out and shakes hand]
'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'.
I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?
Well how long you are going to keep this up?
Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?
I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.
Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?
Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure there are many people who do not like me.
Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.
Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, "Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms."
Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's uh yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it?
Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.
No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.
Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.
Can't you at least die with a little dignity?
I don't know, opera, it?s not my kind of thing.
Um, who do I make it out to?
We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it?
Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off.
Why, what's wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders)
I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.
First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.
Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go.
No, George was there, he said he had a great time.
Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!
This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy.
When's he leaving? (putting some items into the refrigerator)
We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.
Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.
Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?
We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?
May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" across the painting)
If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.
Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. Weve been doing this silly, dumb voice.
Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people.
(firmly matter-of-fact) Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.
Oh, that guy was your cousin! (walking in front of George so he gets the picture to leave)
You don't even know what a write off is.
Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?
I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
(pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you lay it out on the bed.
I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!
Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?
Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying "mickey"!
No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.
Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment.
Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.
(to George) You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.
Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.
(gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!
That is so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood horse?
Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?
Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.
Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.
Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)
I don't know, but you better keep it up.
That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. Its like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you doing today?
Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?
Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel.
Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?
Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact with --
(impressed) Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.
Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me.
No, but ah, seen any good movies lately?
Im meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.
Well, senator, Id just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it.
Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?
Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?
Why don't you see what you can do?
I'll get you another one just like it!
Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.
That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother.
The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.
No, I dont eat dinner. Dinners for suckers.
Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!
All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.
She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.
Y-You didnt do anything. Its not you, its me. Its- this is very difficult.
And youre sure the floss was the catalyst?
(acting like he was walking on stage) Hey how ya doing? Good to be here.
So, how did you get up there? Did you say you had to use the bathroom?
It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---
Good question. (More to himself than to Elaine) Why are we calling?
Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?
No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.
You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.
Hey...I'm not stupid. I'm looking in that drawer, there's no can opener.
(grunting as he throws bread into the air)
We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these women.
Elaine? How did you rope her into this?
Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see her tonight.
Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing...
I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things about you from George.
Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business.
(annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? Besides it's not a submarine and there's no room for a periscope in a car.
That's funny, that's funny! "I'm sick of cleaning." That's very funny.
The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper!
Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the etiquette?
Look at this, my ankle's all bitten up.
What are you talkin about? Its fine, I love having you here.
(in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.
I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.
Of course I was getting you a note.
Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me?
Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!
Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.
(seeing Kramer struggle to open a soda, spilling it all over) I think the damage is probably already done. (interrupting Kramer's inadequate attempt to clean up the soda) All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene.
--but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is inadvertently sent an insurance--
Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist enters Monk's)
Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.
No, I dont think so. Ive seen you two together. You make each other miserable. Its kismet.
I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are gonna be so sorry!
Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another mistake.
So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.
(pause) I thought you said... "ridicurous." (Donna looks puzzled)
How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a minute. Poppy's from Tuscany. I'm gonna go call him.
George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.
Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.
Yes. Hes a doctor. (Elaine starts to leave. ) Wait a second. (Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in Elaines purse.) (to George) What are you doing?
What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one.
Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?
Pam? What do you care? (Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying a Brentano's bookstore bag.)
The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.
I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?
But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.
I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.
'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.
More Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I don't even have any wood in the house!
Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.
Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat...
To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.
See ya. (Jane Leaves; after the door closes Kramer jumps in shock) what's with you?
I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.
Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.
Wait a minute, that's my ticket! You didn't even want to go.
and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!
(apologetically) Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.
I don't know. So what's this job of yours?
You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?
I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it.
No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.
And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month!
Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- Ill be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too.
(incredulous) You asked her to move in with you?
Got lost? We went to school here for three years.
Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.
Hey, guess what. I just bought my father a Cadillac
I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...
Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?
This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.)
Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.
Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.
I can't go until I find my cufflinks.
Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?
You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!
Well, I didnt uh really mean a pony, per se...
I wonder where Elaine is sitting? I really wanted you to meet her she's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend Tony
It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go. (to old man that enters) It was GEORGE!
Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men
There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.
You know, what you need is a song you can share.
Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress.
I'm right here. (note he has an athletic bandage on his right hand) You're late.
All right, forget it, forget it. Im not taking the place!
I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'
I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.
Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?
Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, they'll believe us.
As a guy I dont know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I dont know how to say, Bill, I feel I need to see other men. Do you know what I mean? Theres nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think thats the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because theyre two guys. Thats almost all we need to have in common. Cause sports  sports and women  is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, So, whats in the refrigerator?
But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?
I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!
(adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.
It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look (searches for word) stupid. (to salesman) I'm sorry.
Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery.
This is insane. You know, I dont even know where shes staying! She, shes not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.
Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that. (stepping over Elaine then George's legs to get to the large blue chair and sits down.)
You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you... (catches himself)
Well, thats it. You two are back together.
Okay, how about this I'm in my apartment, you come in.
What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.
I said yes, but I don't feel right about it. I mean I hardly know the guy. That's a big step oin a relationship. The biggest. That's like going all the way.
Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money?
Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?
So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing?
Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.
I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special treatment.
All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now, be reasonable you cannot turn down $50 for a $6 rye.
No, I told you, it's just a dry run.
No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.
As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protg of my own.
You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...
Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?
Great talkin' to you. (Nina leaves. To himself) What the hell is e-mail?
But then I found out about the skin cancer.
Yeah Ive got this old bottle of cough medicine.
Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be.
...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to.
You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.
The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.
What do you mean you're in the same class?
yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas..
Oh! I got a message. (presses button on answer machine)
I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!
We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.
No ,no I don't, I mean, Don't be silly..
Yes you do. That's what you both think.
Get out of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The Heart Attack')
(indicates with his thumb) Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.
Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?
I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.
Yeah , she's coming to see my act tonight.
Who do you know? He knows my hair.
Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.
Shes right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, Im gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.
I couldnt tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that
So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box.
So I can see her tonight, and you dont care?
Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.
It's like Im talking to my Aunt Sylvia here.
I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give!
Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, "You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"
(Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this.
Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch?
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world He's Boring.
Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll uh try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. (Goes into his room, and comes back out with the jacket on.) Ahh, haven't worn this one in a long time.
Oh, really. (Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.)
You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?
(to George) Hey, there's Pat. (calls) Hey, Pat.
Now thats not fair! So where did you meet this guy?
I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!
Yes. I do love her. (to baby) You have a very nice place here.
Im a guy  it always looks like that.
Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 630 and gimme a call.
Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved.
There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again.
You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while, no matter how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because they're crawling , crawling on your skin. Up your legs , up your spine , up your back.....
Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up)
Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, Ill see ya.
You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?
Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.
When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers.
Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.
Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
(agreeing) well three years is a long time to be married.
I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
So how did you leave it with him?
She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply)
Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.
Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.
We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?
Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)
So as he's telling the story he starts crying.
I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.
Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg.
I've been waiting a while for this. You know it's a shame Tony got all banged up, we're not gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
Yeah, but how could you be so sure?
(giving him a steak from the fridge) Here ya go.
It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.
He could have said "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.
Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.
All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter)
And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.
Well, how much are you going to invest?
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--
I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.
Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday.
I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club.
Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?
All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.
I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..
You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.
Okay... but theres no cake or anything, if thats what youre looking for.
(looking after the guys) That nut is always up to something.
You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.
Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.
Your breath is fine. It's delightful, it's delicious.
Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
(on phone) Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act (pauses for response from Adrian) No new material (Elaine enters) He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week, it killed. (waves hello to Elaine; pauses for response from Adrian) Thank you, thanks fo.. you will not regret this. Ok, Bye. (hangs up phone; to Elaine) Hey.
-programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'
I mean, she called me. I havent called her. She started it.
Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?
Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
Aw.. right, code of silence.. how's that going?....Ha!!...
Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere... I got my bags, I'm ready to go.
Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.
Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for membership.
Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.
(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
Kramer you're going to have to face her some time
What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?
But you said, it can be very serious.
(to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.
Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal right now. (covers Jean-Paul with a blanket)
Oh, I cant begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.
Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!
Alright. (Approaches host) Excuse me, this is your party, right?
Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...
(Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.
The average person in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.
Let's get outta here. [to Buckles] I'll see ya.
Well, if that's not that, what is that?
..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Packyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of (wipes his brow) pizza and uh the uh and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling em (does juggling motions) he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. (Swallows and takes a breath) Well we all just lost it. (Fulton not laughing, stone faced) It was really really funny.
Well you're not even a fan. I was at game six - you didn't even watch it.
Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here.
(to Kramer) It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Wheres she gonna get five thousand? She doesnt have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. Shes gone. Then you come in, Why dont you loan her five thousand? What do you care? Youve got five thousand. Give her five thousand!
I dont get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?
(interrupting) Can I talk to you for a second?
I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 1130.
They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record.
Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.
What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.
Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now?
(Takes the ticket back and looks at it, flips it over) The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too.
And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.
Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle?
It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.
Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?
You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?
(under his breath) Well, this worked out just as I had hoped.
Didn't you see the sign on the door?
I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.
Yeah. Specifically 930 shows. Seen any good 930 shows at the Paragon, Willie?
(Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) It'll be on your conscience.
His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I wouldve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. Hes so self-involved.
Of course she doesnt have five thousand dollars!
You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.
(admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.
I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy could write checks to himself right out of my account.
Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?
Yes, but lets just stop it right there.
I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.
Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.
Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.
Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?
Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Uh, gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. Alright let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... (looks at Joe; Joe gives him a weird look)ooo, just right... and three plantains uh ought to do it.
Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.
Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?
So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?
What are you doing? You're choking me. Elaine!
Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here.
No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!
Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on.
Alright, come on, lets get out of here.
Could you make a little more noise? (To his parents) Listen, I'm gonna have to call you later.
Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days!
I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin else.
Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.
Hey, it's one thing if I asked you "Could you do me a favor?" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE (Obviously up to something. Jerry doesn't suspect anything - yet) Whey you told me what you went through on the plane, it makes you stop and think. You appreciate having a real friend.
(on phone) Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago.
So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.
Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?
So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?
Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? "You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know "No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back."
Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?
You never really had the right comeback, anyway.
Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.
Its very good cantaloupe. (Kramer leaves; to George) So thats it? Youre out?
All right, I'll call 911. Think he did it? Could've he done it? Couldn't done it? How could've he done it? Couldn't be? Could it? Hello 911? How are you? I'm sorry it was just a reflex...I know it's an emergency number...it is an emergency...my friend is being accused of being a smog strangler and I know he didn't do it...they're putting me trough to the detective in charge of the investigation...what is my name? Who am I? I'm eh...George Costanza...
There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair, striped shirt?
Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred!
Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.
So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.
Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your guy?
What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What are you Peter Lorre?
There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.
That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
12 gauge. Seems to be the most popular gauge.
I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race.
(Reasoning) You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place!
That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?
(taps George's chest) Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six.'
No move. So, you see, its all part of a divine plan.
W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?
Well you can't take her maybe you can't take me either.
How much was it to clean the vest?
Expecting Newman? That's funny because I just happened upon him down at the Kenny Roger's Roasters.
Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?
You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.
What did you do the rest of the day?
I don't think so. Why would I do that?
(Fishing for his keys in a kitchen drawer) You know, when I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time.
Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.
What could possess anyone to throw a party? I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.
Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to fancy restaurants. (takes a sip of water)
I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.
So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?
Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.
(sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.
and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye.
George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.
No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-
It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes the door) Give me that back.
Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway.
(to George) She thinks it's someone named Raef.
Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.)
What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.
So Marcelino's going to take down the check?
Were you crying? I mean, its just a grape. Youll find it.
Yeah.. how about this I say "How's it goin'?"
Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.
(disbelief) So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?!
You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.
I'm going to the hospital to see Fulton. I'm not even saying hello, I'm going right into material.
Golden Boys always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry. Here... touch Golden Boy!
It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?
It's over there. I know where it is.
(Disgusted. To the woman) Oh, come on. You know he's a postman, don't ya?
Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.
Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain.
(animated) You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I...
Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!
(ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.
I don't know  he's got some valuable antiques, He's worried they'll break something.
Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?
Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.
I'm callin' Elaine. See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley.
They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.
(To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.
You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.
(shrugs) Hey George I think I want to bring a date to the wedding
Alright, then just get rid of it. You wont have any problem.
(Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to look, but Jerry stops her) I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs.
All right. How 'bout this one let's say you're abducted by aliens.
I'll pick you up at your apartment. We'll go to the Eight.
Sure, its like robbing a bank. You dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.
Thats the bet! (The phone rings; Jerry answers it.) Hello?... No- oh, hi... (Kramer leaves) no, they just left... Oh, my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch em. (Jerry goes over to the window and opens it; calling out the window) Ma! Ma! Up here! Dont get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!!
(places two slices of bread against Kramer's face) That is close.
(Gestures to his forehead) Youre getting that vein again.
All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.
And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
(To cashier) I'd like to speak with the manager, please.
Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner?
(to Elaine) Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?
Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll watch 'em go slice this fat bastard up. (sips coffee)
All right, I'll see you after school. I,,m late for Hayman's hygiene.
What did you have to give your TV away to George for?
(talking to Beth on the phone) Could you put him on, I'd love to say hello.
I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!
So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?
Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.
Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.
Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's.
A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.
So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh?
Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.
I don't know, but you look like you're happy.
(referring to George's outfit) And what mood is this.
I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal?
Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it They're roommates. She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back. She's not gonna do that.
I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.
That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this, okay...
Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish...
(in a tuxedo) So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a woman that won't have sex with you.
(To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.
you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?
Dirt? That's alright, (for Jenna's benefit) because there's nothing wrong with dirt.
Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune.
Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you.
So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.
I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.
Yeah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.
(Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?
The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.
Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didnt want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And its been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. (to Kramer) All right, so, just take what you want and lets get it out of here.
No you go on ahead, I'll take the bus.
He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.
Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin?
Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews.
That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's.
No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.
Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number.
You can't. That's why they lose very few players.
All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the bottle of fungicide.)
...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.
Oh my god! Look what's goin' on here! She is depraved! (Grabs a towel and brings it to Lena.) There you are.
Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight!
George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guys got a coma going like this  you dont want to mess with it.
Come on, Go in, go in! [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again]
I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.
No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?
Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. (Rachel shocked)
You're not going to open with that, are you?
Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.
I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club...
I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it.
We'll see about that. (Runs to the window and shouts up to Kramer, who's on the roof.) Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win!
Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.
I know nothing, but what did you actually do?
In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.
I didnt know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrants going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesnt make sense. Am I wrong?
No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!
The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.
alright I changed my mind, uh yeah I don't think I'm not gonna go now
(touching the back of his neck) It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.
Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... Im sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if...
Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I-I just wanted to ask you a question when we we're going out did you have orgasms?... Okay, thanks... No that's it... Ya, Okay, bye.
So was I right? She likes me, right?
Now, I should tell you that, at this point, she's under the impression that youre - a - ah
(Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here?
Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida.
Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?
Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.
(to waiter) Ill have a cranberry juice with two limes.
Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman...
I don't like this Kramer. Will it be much longer?
You know, I don't even know my IQ.
You want to go to Mendys, Ill take you to Mendys.
I mean it's no big deal. You're still drivin'. You should have been watching the road.
Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.
How do you stop a kid from growing?
Fluff and Fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.
You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.
Well, then Im not going to the game either. Okay? Ill give him both tickets.
There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing.
This stuff on top is my friends. Could I get it done in a separate machine?
So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else in real estate?
You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that.
See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey George, look, I'm not funny now.
That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without the cushy timeslot.
Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down. It's a business.
Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.
I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away)
Oh! but I do. There's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar. ( as he says this Newman is wildly scratching behind his back. he suddenly stops when Jerry turns around)
Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there.
You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.
It's stuck. (pained) Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood.
What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?
You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.
How you gonna get out of *that* one?
Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know its missing, and he took it! And of all things to take! I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. Hes crazy.
You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. (Phone rings, he answers it) Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend.
That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.
Yeah. (Kramer sits in the seat next to Jerry) Uh, uh, oh, oh, Over there. (points to the next seat over)
I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. (Picks up the phone and dials.)
You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.
Well, would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.)
Well I, I can't believe this. I know Phil, he, he's a good friend of mine. We play softball together. How could this be?
Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it.?
So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.
Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?
Yeah, big missing goin' on (spreads arms wide)
Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those orange cones you have on the throughway... (Sees pilot) on the way... up here... um... I..
TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.
Widower? Wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research)
Alright! (picks up the phone and dials) Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. You know, you got a great 'John Houseman' name. Alec Berg. Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg?
We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, hey maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!?
(To Elaine) It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's unconscious.
Religion, my friend, thats what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that its going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.
Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned it...
All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.
I got one problem. Youre keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that shes coming.
It's alright, I want you to have it.
How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?
Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full.
So she kicked him out of the apartment.
My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!
It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.
My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while.
Dont do the apples. Its enough already with the apples.
I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.
I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!
I cant. Im on my way out. Theres no way I can do it.
Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.
You had how many dates with him? Three?
Oh, great. Ok we'll goin' away. I think I'm excited.
Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what are you doing?
Well its not like it's a really funny story or anything.
It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.
You promise you'll never come in here again?
No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?
Well maybe he's got like a, cheerful mental hold on you.
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.
No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?
I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.
Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.
That's enough. (They leave. George comes around the corner.)
Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!
There he is. He's going into that bar.
This is Outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit.
Don't look at him. (Phil starts to knock on the door)
Oh, Im sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.
(smugly, under-his-breath) Not only that, I broke his thumbs.
I'm NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT! ..
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.
So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?
Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me?
Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
It's been three days already, forget about Lupe.
She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.
Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.
No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.
Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?
Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.
Why would I freak out? (To himself) Pilot...
Hey, have fun at the... family reunion. (George exits) So, what do you know about this Jack fellow?
Oh Yeah we went way out and wild.
What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up.
Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)
You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner.
I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.
(reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.
Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.
You know what? I'll be with you in a minute.
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!
Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?
I was out in the snow last night.
I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.
Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.
All right Ramon, Im going to get going.
Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Caf Latte?
How would you describe the smell in this house?
Revenge date? That sound like you more than me.
Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made.
Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. (Faint) I don't care about that.
All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?
You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
You know I went out once with a nude model. Never let me see her naked. Hundreds of people see her naked every week, except me. Needless to say it was quite vexing.
You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.
So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER
so the woman was walking around in a bra
Well you've really built yourself up into something.
Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket.
My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didnt want to move to Florida, but theyre in their sixties, and thats the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old peoples house with a golf cart, jump out, Lets go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. Drop it! I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversations so boring. Its so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, What if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass. You know. Come back in, theres broken glass, everybodys all upset. No, Im all right. I was just a little bored there. And uh no, Im fine. I came back. I wanted to hear a little more about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Lets pick it up right there.
No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.
Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.
"Hey, by the way, did you ever call that guy from the health club.?"
Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand.
Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.
Why, you don't think it's a good job?
Oh, well, I didnt actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into him there. (putting on coat)
"The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour". I'm confused.
I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...
No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him.
Well , as I said this type of thing is very common in show business
Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.
"I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite."
Do you even know what this scene is about?
Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.
Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?
Well you should hear the message from my nut. Where's George and Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, I feel very vulnerable.
We're in the middle of a discussion here.
No, shes a little too cheery for me.
This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.
I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.
Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.
Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?
I've hardly been out to dinner with them.
Look, let me just give you the forty, plus another twenty for your trouble.
Hey, I thought you went to the game.
(into phone) Hello Joe, listen this is Jerry Seinfeld, I really think there?s been a huge colossal misunderstanding,
What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?
(Looking down at the shirt; mumbling) Oh, thank you.
Soon as I get off the phone wih you.
So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.
Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.
"Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old married couple--" *I told you that pear was washed*!
You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didnt take it. (pointing to himself) This is an idiot.
Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage from her yet!
You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.
Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?
A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.
(looking at the TV) Look at the picture on this thing...
(thinks) Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize?
By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.
H... G... F. Seat four. One, two, three... f-- Hello Newman.
Hey, look, there's Bobby Eighteen?s father-in-law, Mr Reichman. George and I were just talking about that today, I can?t believe it! That?s the guy who threw George out of the wedding.
What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?
Well, that's it! Tonight's the night. I'm getting one. No "if and's or but's".
First of all, I made plans with Elaine.
First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.
I dont know, I don't feel so good.
Kramer there's no way you stick to this.
Technically, you're sauted. So, what are you doing for that?
Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.
Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.
So you want to catch a movie later?
Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?
I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.
Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.
No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.
You had a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with my butler?
Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.
Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up) Since I said what?
Well, either you see him or you don't.
Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?
Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.
Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.
Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed...
Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.
Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.
Oh, no don't say that. You'll jinx me.
Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.
Lemme see if I understand this. In other words, you held out
So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George?
When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.
What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?
The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.
Ah, just, you know, I don't know. Stuff, I gotta do. (grabs coat and throws it over his shoulder)
Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car!
But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!
..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beveridged!
No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!
Hey look at this. What is going on here?
I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.
Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?
Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.
(in a hurry) Yea you're leaving at three o'clock.
So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!
Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener - what other conclusion could one reach? (The phone rings.)
You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.
Um, actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet. (takes the paper back)
They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
That's it! No more questions! I don't care!
In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame.
Oh, I know her. I know her type.
She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?
You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.
Oh, you want to try the syrup! (Meryl smiles and takes it. The waitress comes over.)
There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?
Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?
My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin' "where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?"
Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.
That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow. It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.
Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.
She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults. Things you would know very little about.
So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.
Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee.
I guess they leave that up to the general population.
Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door)
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
(dry) I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw? (really disappointed) Let's get out of here George.
she's one of these people, always have to be different
Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.
Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened. (listens) Well, I think you should. Okay, bye.
I want this baby fully loaded. (listens) Well, how soon can you get it there? (listens) Oh, that's terrific. (listens) Okay, thanks, bye.
I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I cant imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but thats me. Alright
What is that? (Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.)
(to the Drake) So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome... (to Elaine) They loved the TV, *loved* it!
Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket?
(Shrugs) Oops. (Continues walking along the route, whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street, then keeps walking)
Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.
(on phone) But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.
40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?
You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is! I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, someone asks me which way is Israel, I don't fly off the handle.
(Fed up) Alright! Excuse me! (Gets up) I'm not buying any of this!
I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.
Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign.
Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!
(quietly) I told you to cut it out.
Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it.
"No no you said George likes spicy chicken."
Oh the baby's fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt.
No, no. It-It's really funny. There's these two guys-
Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?
Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it.
I think he's the same age as the father.
So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?
Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...
Oh. yeah. Alright. (pushes Kramer and Elaine out the door, then sits next to Sidra on the couch.) So, where were we?
I'll call back, thank you. (hangs up the phone) He went to South America!
Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I?
So you want to just abolish all home package deliveries.
you know I'd like to hear about this job of yours
Well it's been quite a night I could sure use a cup of coffee.
What about this? This is blood isn't it?!
Yeah, dont investigate, dont pay me back, it was an accident.
(Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.
Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.
(Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying.
You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?
Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.
Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?
Oh I dont know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing.
George got him fired. He squealed on him.
In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.
So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye.
Hey you know George isn't to happy, ahh, about your new friendship.
Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-
How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go.
I kinda like this opera crowd, I feel tough... Anybody else got a problem?
You're pretty comfortable up there eh, Bubble boy?
He was in the shop. I thought you told me he wasn't going to be there.
(CONT'D) And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.
He bothers me. I dont even answer the phone anymore because of him. Hes turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.
Wait a minute! (A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.)
So Whatley sayd to me, "Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic."
Hey. How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?
Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up!
Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.
Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno.
No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture.
(While looking at posters of women wearing glasses) I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.
That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great! (he starts to install the table)
Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm.
Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.
No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.
No. We gotta go to the soup place.
You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.
Yeah, I think it is. (They walk toward the man. Jerry hesitates.) Wheres Elaine?
Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!
I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.
Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.)
Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup of Decaf. (leaves table)
Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.
Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?
Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin?
You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.
He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about "Jerry."
Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!
(on the phone) Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it?
Why'd you have to say anything to her?
(into the phone, with a disguised voice) So, what's going on?
She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.
They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.
Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.
(motions of making out) Well you were involved in some sort of amorous...
That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?
Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay... is uh...
I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright, I'm dropping you off at work, right?
I'll see you later. (he leaves with unseemly haste)
No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.
Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?
Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?
I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.
Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.
But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.
(standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. (indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.
Maybe I didnt want to talk to him.
I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you?
Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)
See you later. (to Elaine) Well we cant all be dating podiatrists. (Elaine laughs)
It has nothing to do with her sister.
(nodding awkwardly for a moment) All right, I think we're done here. (Jerry leaves and Phil shuts the door darkly)
Why didn't you come up with your own?
Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?
I can't figure out what's going on here. I can't follow the plot. Why did they kill that guy? I thought he was with them?
See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.
hey, uh.. (Kramer walks around a little) what'd you get there?
A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?
Seth, it's me. What's more important than catching up with an old college buddy?
But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.
So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!
Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much. (To Kramer) I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!
Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.
What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?
(in a hurry) Ya how you gonna get all this done in time?
Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours?
Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises?
Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.
We don't hear that. (They enter the elevator)
Hey, I had nothing to do with it.
Then what do you call it? People dont just bump into each other and have sex. This isnt cinemax.
I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something!
(Giving Newman a sour look) I'm just hanging out in this hell-hole because of George.
What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.
Yeah, Ill have the egg salad on whole wheat.
Well, what's going on? What is this thing?
..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye. HA Ha..Who do these women think they're dealing with? Did she think she was gonna leave this incredibly erotic message on my tape and I was just gonna let it go. Not Bloody likely...
Where did you come up with all that stuff?
Listen, Matthew, I-I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do.
He's... trying to get something off his chest.
What are you all out of breath from?
...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code.
(Noting) You know, I've never seen you drive.
Of course not, if I did would you have gone?
I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.
why don't you just break it off with her. tell her it's over
I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?
Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.
Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.
No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station.
You can't go to China What about your job?
The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too.
Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses.
(having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.
Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?
So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?
All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a mnage  trois with her and her roommate.
Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone)
C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!
No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.
Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.
(Excited) I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!
This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes) Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?
Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just wanted to pick it up.
Well... theres a little bit of a problem.
See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! Then come out with the regular!
Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again)
He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal.
You picked up on a vibe, from a nun.
yeah, it's a damn shame, a damn shame!
(a little confused) You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables?
Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.
(indicating the woman) Game, set and match, huh Milos?
(answering) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Um, its for you.
That?s what I?ll do, I?ll just call him and tell him, I?ll tell him. That?s all I?ll do. He's a human being, I?ll talk to him. He'll understand. Right?
I gotta say, thats pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.
So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
How about we leave and, come back in a week?
Aren't you going to take the check down?
You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.
So, Im on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the...
I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?
You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... (he spots a mailman crouched emptying a box) Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.
Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late.
Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon?
Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not, a chicken.
Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.
Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)
I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.
Ya sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? (Meryl laughs. The owner of the coffee shop comes over.)
John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.
(turning to Kramer) That's nice for the freaks.
I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.
Yeah, okay. (to Elaine) They may have found the car.
Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, "Oh. Tube socks." What are you gonna do about it?
I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there.
(TO GEORGE, REWOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?
So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?
Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.)
Shes waking down the street and it hit her in the head!
(to the phone) Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you- Oh, Hi. Joel... Oh, you just came in... Listen, I cant make it to the game tonight... I, uh, have to tutor my nephew... Yeah, hes got an exam tomorrow... Geometry... You know, trapezoids, rhombus... Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. Theyre at the Will-Call window... And Im really sorry... Have a good time... Well talk next week... Okay... Yeah, I dont... Fine.. Fine... Bye.
You do of course try on, when you buy?
Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.
Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.
All right, fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone)
Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.
Ohh ... (takes the ticket and heads for the dressing room)
Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!
Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!
(thinking) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume...
You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.
Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.
It would be nice to care about someone.
No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.
(Trying to change the subject away from Nina) Hey - Hey Kramer, what are you doing? You want to borrow something? You want to eat something? Come on in!
What are you doing? Were going out for dinner in ten minutes.
How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?
Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.
Get in there. (he pushes George in the direction of the restaurant)
I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?
What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.
Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.
No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.
(to George) Did you call me a wuss?
Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches)
What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these, like Superman? I've got to unlock this mystery.
But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.
You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I give you 50 bucks.
You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for?
Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up?
I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, "Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me." But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?
I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.
(TO GEORGE) Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?
We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.
Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.
I always feel bad for the silver medal winner in the Olympics. How do you live with that the rest of your life? People are gonna keep asking, "- How much did you lose by? - I don't even know...! It was like...(very fast) now.now...now.now..now..was like, like... now..now..now...! It was it...! Eh, it was it and I lost. I trained, I worked out, I exercised, I did everything, I was doing push-ups, sit-ups, I never did anything but exercise and work out for 20 years, I flew half way around the world and aaaaaaaaaah!...(showing a tiny distance between his index and thumb) And that was...it was a photo-finish! Silver...(stretching his neck forward)...gold. If I had a pimple, I would've won.
Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--
Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!
Don't feel right? What are you talking about?
I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.
You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.
Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen "Girlie" Brown would be very proud of you.
Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.
So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on me.
Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.
Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door)
Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.
Well, I'm very mysterious by nature. (Jerry knocks on the door) A lot of women find that attractive.
What, do you think I care about the money? Is that what you think? You want me to show you what I care about money? Here look, here look at this, here's a dollar here look, there, that?s how much I care about money.
Oh, what about this one? Look at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for. (Sits on the couch.) Oh, yeah!
Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves)
No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, hes treatin me just like a regular customer, now!
Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh, Ketchup? Pretty name for a girl.
(leaving; singing) She'll be coming around the mountain...
(getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.
Ill call him. (Jerry picks up the cordless phone. He points to the rotary phone on the coffee table. Kramer, George, and Elaine struggle for it.) Hello, Ray?... Hi, Ray, this is Ravas friend, Elaines friend, Jerry... The King of Comedy, right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? (He covers the reciever and yells at Kramer and George.) Would you shut up?! (to the phone) Yeah, you dont want to talk about it over the phone?.. You dont want Rava to hear?... Yeah, I understand... You know that coffee shop near my house, Monks?... All right, tomorrow... One o clock... Great, okay, bye.
(looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!
Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley.
But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him.
That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.
First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.
Jenna's like me. She's very... (searches for word)
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.
Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat)
Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over this whole operation!
Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid...
Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.
AH. Yes that's gonna make a big difference.
Well, I-I-I told my wife not to bring it.
(turning to Elaine; thinking) Oh no, not now.
No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.
How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?
Yeah, well that relationships really got a lot of potential.
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.
Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.
Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)
Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?
I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.
Get in the car! Get in the car!
Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.
...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.
Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by the big showcase tonight.
Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.
(starts pulling them apart) Alright break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells)
It's not one of those 976 calls, is it?
Of course, I stink, you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks..
Im just gonna get my jacket, Ill meet you downstairs. Whats the matter, did you call?
Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.
Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.
I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
All right, so I had wooden teeth, so what?
Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.
Are saying you're banning me from the store?
I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?
She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.
So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.
(smiling) Really? That's great. You said that to him?
Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.
You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?
Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.
All right. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle Arbys no more than once a month. And in exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game, and doesnt read a book.
I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.
Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?
Oh, man, look at this mess! You know what's gonna happen if they see this?
Oh! Rimsky -- great great book if I may say so sir. I almost read the whole thing.
It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.
Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.
Forget that. He's a ball player. MVP< 1979. I'm making wise cracks in some night club. This guy was in game six. They're a perfect match. They like go together. They're like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.
George, who is that woman in the stripes?
Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.
Ah, here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) Mmm, delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some.
Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...
I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)
(opening the door) Well, it was nice meeting you.
What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming "There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!" And then, when they all run into the other direction, we'll jump in the car!
Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!
Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.
George what the hell are you doing over there? I told you to mind your own business now stay out of my affairs!
(Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-
(smiling with pleasure) You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile.
What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like theyre trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?
Yes, I know youre not gonna do it. Thats why I bet.
Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.
I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.
Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton. **
No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.
Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!
Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.
Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up.
An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. (Elevator doors open) Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. (Everyone but Jerry is now in the elevator. Jerry's still addressing them) Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?! (Elevator doors shut. A few people in the hallway are looking at him, he turns and addresses them) I am not an animal!
Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear?
Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?
Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. (Elaine smiles and rolls her eyes at him) What brings you here?
Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.
Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out...
I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.
Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here.
Oh why don't you go sleep over at Newman's.
Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?
Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.
No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!
I mean I'm happy sometimes, but-but not now.
Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it.
Well. (calling down the hall) Call if you're gonna be late!
So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister...
I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?
You know, I really... Ive come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that theyre just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you dont really wanna see them. You dont call them, they call you. You dont call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you dont really have anything in common with is to pretend youre hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend theres a little desk around you. The only problem with this is theres no way you can say, Hey, its been great having you on the show. Were out of time.
[forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell out of here!
But its common sense. Hes got super strength, super speed. Im sure hes got super humor.
Oh No, wait a second... Wait a second... I-I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name.
Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?
(leaving the room) I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much.
Ah, dinner! Thats it, youre all the way back!
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.
Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.
I don't know. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley..."
Im sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.
I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.
(Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining room doorway) I think the busboy's in trouble.
See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'.
(Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So we're on for later?
Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.
"What are you doing that for, you got a job"
You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.
(thinking) Whats going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, shes too good to be alone. Whats the difference, I cant maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me.
(on the phone) Hello? No, Im sorry Bania ... Im not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye.
Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
Look I really don't know what they're plans are.
What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to Kramers door) Ah hah.
Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.
No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up?
Yes. I do. You show me where there's a can opener in that drawer. (Answers the phone.) Hello! I'm sorry, I'm just fighting with my wife.
He is merry, I'll give him that. (notices a cactus on the table) What's this plant for?
(still watching tv; sounds like basketball) Bottle-wipe supercedes it.
(cynical) This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday?
Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.
Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before. Your hook is too small. This is for, like, a muffin. All right. Take it away.
I didn't know it was possible not to know that.
Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?
Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?
So what are calling me six times a day?
By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.
(flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb.
Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.
How do you like that? (tries to turn away again; thinking)Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I cant, I cant. Im stuck.
Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit?
Either that, or theyve got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why dont you just go to the cashier?
I know. Im really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.
There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her
Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.
It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something.
They really should mention that in the breakdown height, weight, goiter.
Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit.
Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.
Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.
You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.
Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.
I dont know how Im going to tell him.
Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?
So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?
Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?
(Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled "Ori-dent") Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!
(Reading words George wrote on his hand) "Matthew, Luke, Paul", what youre cheating on your conversion chest?
I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...
God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?
Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.
Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her!
It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.
Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.
Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.
Good. And Ill tell you what... You dont have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.
You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.
Ah. But they told us we must go now.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, whats going on?
So George, how do I beat this lie detector?
All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll meet you in front of the theatre.
I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.
(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!
Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.
Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?
So what about the "Maestro" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.
Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.
If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.
Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.
Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.
I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..
You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.
Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh
You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.
Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?
You know why? Because people like to say "salsa." "Excuse me, do you have salsa?" "We need more salsa." "Where is the salsa? No salsa?"
(He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.
Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.
Hey. Why didn't cha get the big one?
(grabbing the list from Kramer) You're not getting any plantains.
Come on up . (looks at his watch) ...What's he doing here now?
(Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.
(pointedly) Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars.
No, no. Its not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, its not like Marlenes a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, weve had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling. (George nods.) And its these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if Im busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and shes in the middle of a sentence!
All right, but you have to go now.
Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog strangler. (George leans close) would you suck a mint or something. Can I come right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where we are. Where are we?
Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that?
Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting.
Well, I got to talk her out of this.
He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. (Mimics brushing his teeth) Away from the gums... (The door opens a little, George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and Elaine, then enters.)
I would like to know what my names doin in this creep's organizer to begin with.
Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strange the whole flight?
Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.
Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)
...I got you an apartment in this building.
You unwittingly made a major commitment. That's a lot of pressure.
But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.
Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Yknow Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, shes probably screamin at those aliens, I gotta have a lo mein!
Hey ,You think that Shelly's upset that I made such a big deal about the pecan.
Well, for one think, don't listen to him.
Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.
No, let's just do it. (Fire alarm goes off) What? What is going on? What is that about?
Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.
I did not. You guys gonna go through some red lights?
I gotta talk to her. What do you think?
(looking at Kramer's moustache) Uh, we're not doing that anymore.
What, theres something wrong with Loni Anderson? (pause) Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it.
If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. Hes always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess its because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.
He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, that were manufactured in Korea.
The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves)
Let me call him back... Hello? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.
They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.
Yknow, my parents are coming in for this...
Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.
Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your..
"No ,Elaine and I we're just discussing whether I could admit a man is attractive."
Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.
(Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my domain. But I will tell you this I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!
Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!
Hell have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
All right, sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) George?
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?
How about when Harrison Ford jumped out of that plane, and he was shooting back at them as he was falling?
What the hell he's supposed to be on medication I don't understand he told me he's getting medication what happened to his medication!?
Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.
Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.
...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.
Well, I brought them up there to take his records--
I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife fight for a citrus drink.
Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend.
Well don't get too comfortable. As soon as Seth gets a real job you two are gong back in that chicken supernova.
Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!
I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table.
Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago.
Yeah, so do you. (George enters with a newspaper.)
I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.
I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship?
If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.
That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!
He really did an amazing job. Look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid! (Jerry opens refrigerator.) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups! Come here, look at this. (He gets on his knees and points.) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there?! He must be like Rubber Man!
Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.
Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for? I don't know about that, I'll have to think about it. I'll let you know. Okay, bye.
Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and put it in.
I'll go if someone else drives. You going?
No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.
Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.
On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?
I once got Happy New Yeared in March.
Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did!
I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.
He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket books. Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.
Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.
Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal.
Yes, come on! How often do you get engaged? Come on!
I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.
So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?
(to Kramer and Morty) What is this about?
Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You cant do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.
(jumps in surprise) Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be gone.
Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus.
(to Kramer) Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot.
I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy.
Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.
I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.
George? (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.
See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think?
Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document.
Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.
(pause) I don't know, they just tell you the night before.
(on the phone) Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.
No, it&Mac226;s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i...
(looking at the Wizard) Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents.
That puddle! (Kramer sees the puddle and does a double-take.)
That is a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. Some guy from NBC saw my set, he wants me to do a showcase. I might have another shot at a pilot.
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.
Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...
I don't know, but you don't have it.
The one Puddy screamed at in the car?
Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.
(to himself) Hoh, that Milos. (to Patty) Well uh, what shall we do, uhm, care for a cup of coffee?
I don't even think you could do it.
You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.
Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?
Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.
You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't destroy someone else's.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good things.
You're lucky they let you drive a car.
Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.
This is no good. This is no good. Call her house.
(buzzes her up) Eh. (to Kramer) You know and I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying "my wife." Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - "my wife" this, "my wife" that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence.
Well yes I did that's true. A couple of a guys I knew in the coastguard told me about her.... and I sensed that she had the anger and intensity that I needed to make this film work.
Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!
I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
(Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.
Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!
Super bowl! Hey, an original G.I. Joe. (picks up both items) With a full frogman suit.
Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.
OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers?
(with no emotion) It's okay. Everything is going to be all right.
And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.
(tucking in his shirt) Oh ya this is Rachel.
A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision.
The crook has the machine. The messages arent for him. Hes the crook. Why would he answer- (Jerry gives up on the explanation and turns around to see George standing behind him.) How did you get in here?
I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.
That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his fathers band. Hed loan it to you.
Would you turn that down! What is that crap!
Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?
Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!
(Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing *just* a bra. I can't get that image out of my mind.
Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio.
Have you said anything to her about it?
Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!
Thanks, because I would really like... (distractedly puts coffee cup back on the table)
I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y. (he spits it into the waste bin)
(Threatening tone) So, listen, Puddy. When we first started this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you want to play hard ball, I got my friend, George, here, and he can play pretty hard ball. (Leaving the negotiation to George) George, vein it up.
Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?
Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game.
Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.
Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?
Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.
Ohhh... You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.
Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.
This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.
Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I, guess she passed out!
I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a riot.
(Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven!
No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.
My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you dont make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life.
Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. "Oo that little tail really turns me on."
I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.
I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.
Whats with the pink lining and the candy stripes?
(Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here..
So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian...
Not our "all the way", their "all the way." I got the stink of responsibility on me.
The bad fianc&Mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...
Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.
Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why dont you just settle it like mature adults?
Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.
Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.
I suppose if it was on the protg's way to the mentor, they might.
He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in.
We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident.
Aaa. Well ... you want something to eat, don't you?
I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot.
Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. I'm being audited.
Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?
So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...
All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?
Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.
$40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!
What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?
So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo?
Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.
(extemporising) Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was registered under Slappy White.
But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.
I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I - I don't even remember the name of the town.
Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it.
I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.
(upset) Ohhhh, what are you doing? Kessler, its a tape! I taped the game, its one oclock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.
So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.
You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.
Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.
Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency.
So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?
Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?
You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.
Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.
I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.
You told me that already like two months ago.
(to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...
So you were talking, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") you're having pleasant conversation, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") then all of sudden...
(animated) You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about.
A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions) Ho, ho, ho.
Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?
Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?'
George, here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
Oh who made you a Mohel? Whadya, get your degree from a matchbook?
Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've never heard anything like this in my life. Listen to this.
Do you want me to break up with you?
We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.
I dont know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three oclock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someones door and tell them to keep it down? Youre really altering your whole self-image. I mean, what am I, Fred Mertz now? Whats happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. Theres a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh... shh... shhh... shhh... Doesnt work, cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me. Some people you cant shush in a movie theater. Theres always that certain group of people, isnt it? Theyre talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They wont shush. Theyre the unshushables.
Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!
Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? That's like half a pound of turkey!
I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
(to the phone) No believe me, Im always up at this hour. How are you?... Great... Sure... What time does the plane get in?... I got my friend George to take me...
No, no, no. I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.
It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.
No I can't I've got some stuff to do then I've got to meet Keith at my apartment at three. I'm helping him move.
I didnt know. Kramer told me about the worlds.
See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup...
Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in.
No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?
All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar).
Who's got a tissues? I need more tissues! Look at this thing. It's my phone finger!
I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes.
Elaine, how about this shirt? Is this okay?
You know last time you had me throwin' a rye bread up three floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off your car, where does it end?!?
Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.
Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me.
Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys.
What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at work?!?
The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. Cause it says Waiting Room. Theres no chance of not waiting. Cause they call it the waiting room, theyre gonna use it. Theyve got it. Its all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and youve got your little magazine. You pretend youre reading it, but youre really looking at the other people. You know, youre thinking about about them. Things like, I wonder what hes got. As soon as she goes, Im getting her magazine. And then, they finally call you and its a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. Well, I guess Ive been chosen. Ill see you all later. You know, so you think youre going to see the doctor, but youre not, are you? No. Youre going into the next waiting room  the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You dont wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You dont want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in? Do they scalp tickets to these things? I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two...
No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?
Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?
Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?
No, don't stop, Kramer. Keep going, don't let him get away.
It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.
Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat!
Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it.
No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.
Let me explain something to you. You see, youre not normal. Youre a great guy, I love you, but youre a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldnt understand.
(Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do?
Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in!
Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...
(animated) Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and you sold a Cadillac?!
Thirty-six. What's the signal? Howbout this? Chicken wing? No, no, no, I got a better one. Head patting.
(unheard by Jenna) When the battery runs out.
Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?
Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, you were right. I'll do anything!
I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.
It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.
Elaine, George (introducing them to Bania with less enthusiasm)
Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?!
Who was in town on a business venture, and um..
I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?
I dont give out bites. I got another one. But Im saving it for later.
Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls down, make it an eight room luxury suite.
You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.
Are you nuts? You dont even know the guy.
They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What do they look like."
I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? (Kramer holds a broken Tony)
You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married.
It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?
Ya, that's the.. last thing you want to see. Well, next to last.
Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it!
Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again?
Whats the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!
Don't you ever talk about her like that!
I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?
Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.
So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.
And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's pretty sick.
Gina, do you know what a Drakes Coffee Cake is?
Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?
Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!
Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you?
You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?
Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
(Kramer shows Jerry and Elaine the paper) "Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research".." Government funds genetic research at area hospital" ... Yeah, so?
So why didn't you tell her the code?
There's girls everywhere. I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator. They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?
What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy?
Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift. I know, it's a label maker. The Label Baby Junior. Yeah, I hear they're good. Well, label me thankful. Okay, well you enjoy those tickets. Buh-bye.
It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.
(looks round) Don't worry, I'll get you out.
Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...(hugs Meryl.) I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!
For crying out loud, He's Superman. (Fulton stops laughing, Jerry's face is stunned) Fulton? (looks at him) Fulton?
Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?
'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.'
Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.
But then we would have missed the whole thing.
What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.
You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!
It's like we're living in the '50s here.
I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man.
Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.
I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.
Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something.
I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?
Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?
All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.
Ah, I should have got the egg white omelet.
I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses!
So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)
Okay.. (Opens the door to a frantic Elaine)
Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.
Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.
Good, going good (scratches chin) And the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty good - not bad - I gotta get out. (scratches chin, nose then covers eyes with hands)
How can you talk to someone like that?
Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way.
I still don't know what the idea is.
Its a good mirror. (They look at their menus.) So, what are you gettin?
You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.
I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there.
Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it is. (vehement) Just take it!
I thought you were gonna watch a video.
Anyway Beth, you know i was thinking on my way over how when i was 9. I wanted these handball sneakers, they were all black but they came in adult sizes so you know i never got the sneakers. (Beth looks him confused)
(accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?
Why would I leave? This is my apartment.
Hey, I called you last night, where were you?
Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?
Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--
Oh, no. Its not that I dont think you can. I know that you cant, and Im positive that you wont.
Oh, what do you think? I found it at the back of my closet.
See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. (Elaine laughs.) All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free.
I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand.
(To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.
Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.
Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.
He feels funny. You don't have to do this.
You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples clothes
Naw, I gotta wait until its just the right time.
Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.
Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?
Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this?
Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!
Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing.
Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.
I just want a, touch em a little.
Well you know what this means, don't you?
So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.
What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasnt the one.
I dont know. Its got a pink lining.
Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. (Kramer picks up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.) Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! (Kramer starts filling a pot with water.) What are you doing with that?
I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!
Oh yeah. He's good. You know he's John Ritter's cousin.
Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.
Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that?
You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the "Astonishing Tales of Costanza".
All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.
(stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored)
(sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand.
Go look at your face in the mirror.
Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.
I don't need a personal trainer. (Kramer comes in) all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.
How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean, it's only this wide!
(to Ramon) Oh. Okay. (to Elaine) Wh, what is he doing here?
I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
(Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in.
Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me.
Well, whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.)
No, see, we didnt have ponies. Im sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..
It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!
(shouting) Kramer what am I going to do did you hear that that guy's gonna put a kibosh on me he's crazy he's out of his mind....
(To himself) I don't believe this! (Walks over to a security guard) Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with shoplifting..
George, we're trying to have a civilization here.
Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone.
You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial.
Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler.
All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you double what you paid for it.
No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.
No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car.
To wash my hands. Theyre sticky from the orange.
These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86.
And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?
I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers.
Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)
Hey, when Im driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. Im always waving everybody in. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. ...All right. All right. Ill have a chicken salad.
Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?
If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me. He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back.. I'm putting this guy ....RIGHT OUT OF COMMISSION....
If my father was moving this hed had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (as his father) 'Have you got your end?...Your ends got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your ends got to come down.'
Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me (flustered, he indicates a nose pick)
Yeah!.. Thanks.Oh! my god you saved my life.
I asked. Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian football.
It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.
See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.
(coming out from the bathroom) who was it?
So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table
Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.
(Pulls the note out of his pocket) That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.
No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver.
No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off.
(Picks one up) Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?
I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. "Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life." Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, "I had a heart attack this big (Holds out hands, gesturing bigness) ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear! (Puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest) Brrhht.. and it's gone!"
You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me.
Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...
Hey, I got a real thing about "shushing"!
(to Elaine) I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog. (to George) Get this one "I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest".
Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this.
What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!
Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.
The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go "Excuse me, I think you missed a spot."
Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.
It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?
Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I?
I don't know what you should do with it.
(singing) Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home.
(Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after him!
Well what am I going to tell Alex?
I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I? (throws coat over his right shoulder)
You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal(sp?) before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.
If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, Im telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. Im sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.
This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!
Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?
This thing has never worked right. (holding the machine in his hand)
I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.
Cause Im an idiot! You may think youre an idiot, but with all due respect, Im a much bigger idiot than you are.
I don't care, why are you telling me this?
Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.
Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!
I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.
You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.
My bet? All right. Ill open with a tuna sandwich.
Hang on just let me pick up a paper.
(fetching a drink from the fridge) Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.
Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino.
Oh, see that's not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people.
(worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!
you know, I think George has a non-sexual crush on him
Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you.
Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. (Newman considers the implications of this.)
No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.
You know my parents are coming in and I got some clean up to do , so if you and Potsie are done scheming....
Well I guess if I?m the Miana I should go. All right, all right.
(He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.
Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.
No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.
So are you gonna get him a chair?
Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. (They both walk to the booth and sit down. Suddenly, Gwen is attractive) Now this is a good looking booth.
Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, George Louis Costanza. Here I am about to go to the electric chair and my oldest friend is dating the governor
Right in the head! (leans in and points at Testikov)
So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.
I got a date with that girl, Lena.
Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, "Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land." (Imitates cannon operator) "I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you."
(Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical..
Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding.
Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind.
All right, let me ask you this when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?
Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!
Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.
I gave you a taste. What do you want?
Yeah. What's wrong, why? ( George runs back to the bathroom)
So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) "Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again." They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system..."Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to the plane in my apartment." You see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet "hide-a-key" under the wing..."maybe he left it up there somewhere..."
So tonight are you going to make the move?
yeah yeah what is it with you and Tony? what are you? it's like his sidekick now?
Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?
And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.
Did you see the look on that guy's face?
What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?
Oh (laughing) Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting.
I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing.
So the roommate laughed at everything I said.
Well, thats a lot of money. But, if thats the way its gotta be, thats the way its gotta be.
So you want to go to the party on Friday night?
I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory.
(To George) You're off bread. (To Elaine) So what happened is it over?
Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a, its a little crumpled.
No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.
Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about it!
Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?
Hey, wait a second. You know, we could share a cab. They're playing at the same Cineplex.
Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.
(waving the key) You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!
You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.
I don't know how long this is gonna last.
Aw! You'll be fine, you were in there for what , a couple of minutes.
(noticing Alec Berg walk in, whispers) Hey, Alec!
What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?
What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.
Who would order a license plate that says "Assman"?
What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says " Aw, I'll just have some coffee." There's no truth to that.
Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.
Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?
In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.
I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.
You're going out with the stationery store guy?
STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this? Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.
You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder?
(Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.
Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!
If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.
(picks it up) I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table.
Why don't you just get rid of it?
I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.
This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.
(quietly, yet in a high and whiney tone) Well, I don't know if I....
Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
"I don't think so. I think they were getting dressed and not only that; my shirt was out!!!"
George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?
Sure. See, things always even out for me.
Okay, take it easy. (hangs up) That was Keith. we're going to do something next week.
Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?
Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?
I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, Well, its ruined. And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, Its not our fault. Were not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation. You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? Theyre cleaning our clothes, but theyre not getting anything wet. Its all dry. I know theres gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that theyre using. Theres no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (Jerry brushes off his shirt.) Thats dry cleaning. I dont think thats what theyre doing back there. They dont have eighty guys going, Come on, hurry up! Theres a lot of shirts today!
Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr.
So then as I was getting out of the car, ...
Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?
If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!
(interrupts)like a shark fisherman with a bucket of (?) Ch....
It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.
(facing the lengthening line behind him) Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.
Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.
And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.
She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love!
Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?
You know you're not supposed to drink while you're keeping a secret! (Elaine laughs) Is there anything else?
Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.
Uh, you know, why dont you go first, you just had a long trip.
Yeah, Im sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.
It's a cigar store Indian. (to Elaine) Read the card.
Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.
Well, we've got to do something. (grabs his phone) I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.
.. and uh, underwear and a tee shirt.
(throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?
well aside from that from that, how did he like the sandwiches?
All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now.
Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!
(to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)
(opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?
I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.
Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?
Many times. You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet.
Ah, so, ah, flower shows and, shopping for pretty bows, and then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight?
So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, "Jerry"? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They're putting it on the air! They're giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California!
There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.
What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?
So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?
Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting a package.
Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.
I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?
Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 650 AM tomorrow morning.
Let me tell you something Babu. You go back in that kitchen -- tell your chef I want the works.
Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.
You want food, don't cha? (nodding his head up and down)
Well, once I didnt have dinner until, like 900 oclock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage  meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya? Throw out my garbage for me.
Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.
(Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything?
The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.
So what does he care if you put lifts in?
I love the day date. No wine, No shower.
You wanna go with me up to (clap) the Bronx and see if there's any flyers on George's car.
Yeah, let me just stop by the cash machine and I'll meet you over at the coffee shop.
He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.
I just wanted to say how sorry I was...
I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.
Well, Ill tell you what. Ill choose you for it. Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...thats it, you gotta win three.
Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?
Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.
(to George) I mean, come on. (a thought occurs) No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from *Seals and Croft*.
(Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell smoke?
You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?
You know I dont get that whole suicide machine. Theres no tall buildings where these people live? They cant wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?
That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.
Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. It'll crush him.
How'd you expect to get out of here?
Listen, Joel, I dont think we should see each other anymore.
Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
He asked you to watch them not wear them.
I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.
Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--
Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.
Thats not too bad. Its not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!
All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?
You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.
I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.
(Interrupting Bania) Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.
I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck.
You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?
"I dunno how you could forget . He kept reffering to himself in the third person. "Jimmy's under the boards. Jimmy's in the open. Jimmy makes the shot."
Flinched? I did not flinch. George, did I flinch?
Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am  rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give...
Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from ourselves. That's what you said.
When did you get tickets to see that?
Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!
So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building?
I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.
Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?
Pull yourself together. Your going in there soldier! That's an order!
(looks in the creamer) Theres no milk in here, what...
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?
Hmm, I really need to speak with him.
Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer enters)
The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California!
On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?
I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?
(walking towards door with Elaine) How long did you last? (opens door)
I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.
Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.
Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.
..And then she starts talking about her panties.
Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.)
(consternation) Oh no. (to the bedridden two) It's go time.
You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...
Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.
Just go back and ask him again. (Slams the door on Kramer)
We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men.
Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun.
And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.
I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...
(Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So, the last person in should close the door!
I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?
(A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.
Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? (hands Elaine the tape recorder.)
I didn,t tell you to park in that lot .. Now someone's gonna have to drive you every time you need your car.? Take the bus!
Vanessa, thank you. Ive been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.
(Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.
How long are you suppose to leave it on for?
Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestl's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--
Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do.
I think we might have one left in the stock room.
(to Kramer) ...( words missing)...laugh , everything's nice and at the end of the night I go for a little contact. I get the PULL BACK. This woman said the filthiest things I've ever heard in my life. I get the Pull Back.
I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?
Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?
(Pointing) I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.
(trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.
Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. (And to George) What do you mean you can't tell me?
It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.
Im supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?
You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.
Franco's no good? ...They got no team leaders.
Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!
Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?
But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.
I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.
Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)
How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet!
You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 950, I'm not gonna be able to make it!
Well, we gotta get it washed (pulls off a few flyers)....Ah, the keys are locked inside!
Yeah. (thinking) That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. (decisive) I'm gonna do it.
Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.
Do you have to write all this stuff down.
Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!
Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.
Look, what do you want me to do?
Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?
The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off?
You cannot buy half a can of soda.
Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered? (Sees the pac) What happened?
It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.
You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.
(as Ping rambles on ) ...S'cuse me (Ping looks up) Kind of an expensive call.
(taking a catalog) Can I have one? I need one of those old-looking phones. So you wanna grab a bite?
have some more, take some for the road.
Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here!
Alright, I'm gonna get this. This looks good.
No in a matter of fact it isn't.
Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.
Yeah, hes nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper up to Jerry.) I know, I know. Its down again.
He can't just throw me off the plane!
I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?
Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.
Hey, lll just keep swimming. Hey, hey. Im not done. I know what you're up to Ramon. Because Im a member here, this is my place to swim.
Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other line. Just a second.
No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls.
You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard.
I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.
Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.
No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.
Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.
Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.
No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter (pauses) Oh no!
Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal.
Sex, thats meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; thats heavy. Thats like an hour.
You're meetin' the father for the first time?
I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?
You know what the odds are on a crash it's a million to one.
I think that's a "what's good for the goose is good for the gander".
One of the problems in life is that when youre a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, I got the front seat I wanted the front seat! I called it. And the other kid knows hes got nothing to say He called it. What can I do? If there was a Kid Court Of Law, it holds up. Your Honour, my client did ask for the front seat And the judge would go, Did he call it? Well no, he didnt call- BANG! (Jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled.
In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.
Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something.
No, you stay here in the car. I may need you.
Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?
But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.
Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.
Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.
You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.
So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?
You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go... up.
(Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.
Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.
Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.
(re-entering) Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again, are you?
I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.
Hey, thanks a lot for lettin' me stay here.
So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything.
Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car so I don't toss it in that dumpster?
I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table.
Well, I painted my apartment again. Ive been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, its a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize its just the thickness of the paint, but Im aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, its closer and closer. I dont even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. Thats where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control... Thats why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching TV. Thats why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there.
Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. and we got to talking, he sells Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.
Oooh! I got a pain in my side.
I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.
I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
Well, maybe he doesn't have a "get outta here" kind of personality.
Oh really? (tries turning away in the hopes Elaine gets the hint; thinking) Oh God, I gotta get out of this.
No, no......(long pause . they stare at the walls) Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?
Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time.
Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.
Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is.
How do you do? (introducing himself) Uh, Jerry Seinfeld.
You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.
They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor.
I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the plot. It's embarrassing. It's an embarrassment to have to admit, but I'm the one that you see in the parking lot after the movie talking with his friends, going, "Oh, you mean that was the same guy from the <beginning>... Ohhhhhhhhhh..." Nobody will explain it to you. When you're in the theater, you can't find out. [whispering to imaginary friends seated around him] "Why did they kill that guy?... Why did they kill him?... Who was that guy? What was the... I thought he was with them? Wasn't he with them? Why would they kill him if he was with them? Oh, he wasn't *really* with them.... I thought he was with them. It's a good thing they killed him.''
Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?
...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the patient!
Oh, Im sorry. Im just waiting for someone.
What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?
All right, Elaine but this is beyond news. This is like Pearl Harbor. Or the Kennedy assassination. It's like not even news. It's total shock.
Oh, excuse me... Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.
It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ...
Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.
And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!
We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.
Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time.
George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality.
Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?
Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set.
I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.
Oh, yes. Particularly if youre not in it.
Oh, nothing happened, you know, but is was great.
I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood.
Babu? Babu...[waves Babu to come to table] Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just, it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?
Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy.
What! You're the one who ruined her life.
Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.
The apple pie you had today at Monks
Oh, shes really great. I mean, shes got like a real warmth about her and shes really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better.
Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...yknow, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, its dark, theres bubbles happening, theyre all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, Cmon babe, lets go. You come by, you open up the lid and theyll- (stiffens up, as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, theyre in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, Tomorrow, the dryer, Im goin. You wait here! The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you dont see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So theyre showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isnt your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first.
Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. You had to give him a box of cigars.
And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.
So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.
Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money.
What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it.
Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.
And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.
So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?
Youre gonna get back together, anyway. Its thousands of dollars!
(Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.
No appointments at all? (motions to Elaine to move over)
I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.
Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.
Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.
Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.
Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.
No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.
What are you looking at? (Kramer goes out onto the terrace and looks down.) Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold.
No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey)
(with a wild expression) Hey, Kramer! I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open!
(hanging up the phone) Oh! There's my Chinese food, I gotta run. All you.
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.
Hey Doc, check this out. [does an around-the-world with the Yo-Yo]
So, um, do you date uh immature men?
Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.
So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.
Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going "Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going."
So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?
(trying to divert Vic's attention) What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that?
Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.
Hello? Oh, hi honey. (annoyed, weary) Yes, I told him. I'll get it. (George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry to argue with Meryl on the phone.) Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...
Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.
Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there?
(sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there and I will.
(nonplused) You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?
But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?
We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked.
You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.
(hands up) I don't want it that way.
You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.
"Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable..." Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been "outed"! I wasn't even "in"!
Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here. (pointing up and down at George)
(to waitress) I' ll just have a cup of coffee.
Look at you, youre still thinking about it. Ill never feel comfortable.
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!
No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.
oh you think she's Erika, the phone sex woman
I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say.
No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!
(Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.
Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He couldn't! (listens) Alright, I will. (listens) Okay, bye.
Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.
(he hits a few keys and looks over at her) Cash advance... yes (hits a key)  no (he looks over again) balance inquiry... no (he looks again) receipt.... no (he looks again) processing... processing... (He opens the box, pulls out his money and then looks at the woman and says) I won!
Listen, uh I just remembered... Im... uh, getting a facial.
All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? (sits opposite George)
I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals.
So, are you gonna go out with her?
Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night.
I cant believe Im gonna do this. (Jerry opens the door and exits the dressing room. He walks over to Bania)
Can you relax, its a cup of coffee. Claire is a professional waitress.
(Scolding) George. (To salesman) Sorry, were just waiting for David Puddy.
No, go ahead, I second-hand smoke two packs a day.
Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little...
The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like youre always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. Youre out somewhere with people, Gee, you look pregnant.. are you? Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, thats not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Lets take this whole scene again. People, think about what youre saying!
I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)
No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial.
Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?
But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there, "Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin. Well I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on."
I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...
Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe-- "Jerry Jerry Dingleberry", and-hu "Seinsmelled"...
Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough.
Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.
I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.
Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.
Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.
[mockingly] "Please hurry". Look at you. Look at what you've become.
No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.
Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.
Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!
All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.
Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I'm sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.
He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.
Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.
With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.
(Continuing reading) "The Human Fund. Money for people."
Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.
(trying to defuse the situation) Look, no-one is lifting anything.
Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.
Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
(stands, puzzled, it's not sinking in) W-what do you mean?
Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.
Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.
(Over the phone) Elaine, youve got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin me on this car, which is yellow now!
George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.
Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.
So what do you have to say for yourself?
The % thing to do is just not think about it.
You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it.
He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV.
(answering, quickly) If you know what happened in the Met game, dont say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, Im sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no
I think I may have made a big mistake.
Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door.
You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.
(disgusted) Ohh! You know, and sometimes shell go, (imitates Marlene) Hello, Jerry? And Ill go, Oh, hi Marlene. And then its Jerry...
(surveying the restaurant) Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it!
Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?
Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?
So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right?
No,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.
Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.
With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.
Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!
Uh, this is George. (reaches for her name) Im sorry...
I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.
No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex.
Here he is... that's the guy! (rolls up window) No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!
Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?
20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.
Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?
Oh! Come on, you told them you're from out-of-town just so you could stay in a hotel room.
I have to go over to my grandmother's.
Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.
She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.
Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.
A half hour, give me a half our.
Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.
Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?
I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping.
What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!
He left me there. You see the mind games?
Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.
All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.
Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.
You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.
I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody up.
Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.
(talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass.
Great, you're lonely and miserable again. (presses button to call elevator)
(Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?
You can't put a paper towel on his head.
So, can you believe that message? Now I?ve got to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
This is the man you have a crush on?
Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)
Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you.
Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time.
He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication.
So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!" So he says to me, "What are ya gonna do about it?"
Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)
This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?
What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)
There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that...
Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.
Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?
Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a little. .
She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
But your were an executive, this is fast food.
(wistful) I don't know, I just see you guys together.
I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.
Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.
I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something.
(Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing is now?? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!
Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet?
And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.
A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?
From my house. I got a whole box of them.
They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives.
Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?
Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.
Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to an open box) isn't that one of yours?
No. This is why you're not in the pilot.
(Arms out, complaining) I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!
Hey, not bad. (pointing to crest) I kinda like this little thing here.
Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.
You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there.
No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.
(A couple of days ago I used a public phone), go over time on the call, hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, "Yeah, operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?"
They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots.
(C0NT'D) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.
No, no, no, another race - out of the question.
She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.
(rising) I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the speed-dial.
You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.
Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?
How many session did my parents paid for?
Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend.
No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing. (Jerry picks up the phone and dials the number) I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?
Im always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice. Never quite sure, Is this the best lane for me? For my life? Theyre always a little bit ahead of you, Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there? Yeah, come on over here, pal. Were zoomin over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it. The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen? Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday well be going, (Jerry pretends hes driving in reverse.) Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. Im gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.
Is that like the end of the world or something?
(turning on the commercial) Right, quiet dignity. As opposed to, say, this?
Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets.
You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS!
Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.
They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!
What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time
(Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) "Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone." (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out "Just go" while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. (Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her.
I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.
Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad.
Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that.
Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else.
So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.
The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.
So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day?
Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something?
You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?
Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in your friend John Germaine's band there.
Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!
Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.
Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself.
(re the underwear pile) Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now.
It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. "It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad." But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, "I refuse to put any thought into this at all." Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?
How did you lock your keys in the car?
First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--
Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.
Is there a captain's hat involved in this?
I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from.
Latex? And what do I do with latex?
What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.
I got you an apartment in the building.
She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.
No eight years isn't such a long streak.
You see , I kept up my end of the pact.
I thought it was open to the public.
The wheels are in motion, things are happening!
Oh yeah? I dont believe youve seen... this.
He looks like you and he's working from the inside?
Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?
(to Kramer) Hey (snaps fingers) get your stuff, let's get going.
They sell them by the side of the road. Blueberry, Blackberry ....
I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and Ill just make up some excuse why I cant go to the game either.
Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.
Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.
(thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.
(ranting) I can't believe how a little thing like George going too fast - and my whole weekend is gone - the plans, the packing, ... everything.
Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, its with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I mightve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.
I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.
They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing."
Why dont you ask that doctor what it is?
Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar.
I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.
Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years.
I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.
What if she's got no interest in you?
Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah.
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why dont you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin anything?
(Trying to block out Kramer, he starts to sing along with the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus..
Actually, yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!
I really have to go to the bathroom.
No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.
Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?
Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on.
I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone.
(Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key?
No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.
No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.
(answering the phone) Hello? Yeah, the van is still for sale. Sure, come on buy.
Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. (standing) I'm going to the bathroom.
Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.
Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of lobster)
Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.
By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
I dont really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because theres that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, youre sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, Im really sorry about this. I dont know why I left that stuff over there. And thats why I could never be a maid, because Id have an attitude. Id find them, wherever they are in the house, Oh, I suppose you couldnt do this? No, dont get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldnt dust. No, this is too tough, isnt it?
So you're not gonna come back to New York with us?
You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.
I like that. (He opens the closet. Elaine walks out with an angry look.) What do you think, George?
I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.
She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?
I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them are doing her dance as they go)
Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
Yeah, that's a deal. That's a terrible deal. I don't want to go out to dinner with him. Id rather make my own suit.
Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby.
I was ready to get jiggy with it.
Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! Nice job on the circumcision but it's not supposed to be a finger.
He went back? What do you mean he went back?
Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.
W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.
But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.
I know enough not to get on them.
It had fat in it, it's not good for you.
Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, "Those aren't buoys." (Father starts laughing) Father...
Oh, see the baby again with the baby..
Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.
Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
You didn't ... (makes motion like he's lighting a cigar)
You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.
And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral?
Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. (Kramer goes to get the suit. Elaine enters.)
That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice.
Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.
Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! Its a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!
Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?
Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?
(Stops) Alright, that's not gonna work, it's not gonna work. Let me just think for a second here.
They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.
I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.
[whispering] No, no news. You better get out of here.
I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.
You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.
Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?
Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.
NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye.
(Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.
No, I think the head does most of the stretching.
Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?
Well. This should be a very interesting evening.
I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg." But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, "Would you mind?!"
That was Elaine , she changed her mind. She's not coming over.
(After seeing how much his parents like her) Now, I'm not so sure.
(trying to ease the tension) Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends.
Hey, hey. uh Pamelas birthday party, didnt I see you there? Jerry.
(Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..
And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.
Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.
All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've flown first class, Elaine-- I can't go back to coach. I can't... I won't...
Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. (pretends to pull hair out)
Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.
The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!
I got it! (snaps his fingers) We give the keys to Elaine.
You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't remember anything about you.
Hey, do you know what the Whip does?
All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little.
Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!
You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!
Well, theres this uh, woman might be comin in.
Hey, could you do me a favour? [pause] Could you shut-up?
Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there by two o'clock. We should take a cab.
What you must understand, Elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) Youve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.
Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.
I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?
Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!
Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?
Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour.
....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together.
This has 'international incident' written all over it.
I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.
That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.
No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing.
Same as you cant overwet. You see, once something is wet, its wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die youre dead, right? Lets say you drop dead and I shoot you. Youre not gonna die again, youre already dead. You cant overdie, you cant overdry.
I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.
Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! (runs back to his seat) Bad lighting on the porch.
(As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George.
Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.
Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.
You must have quite a time down there.
Yknow what? This is not that bad an idea.
You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.
Hi. Ah look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna.
Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)
Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.
The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.
I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all.
I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.
I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!
Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.
Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.
I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave.
Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail.
Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.
He was down at the other end. So he yells out, "Ready, On your mark, Get set, " and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.
Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?
(looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!
Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?
George, this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on. (Jerry leaves.)
By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?
(through gritted teeth) Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.
Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, No egg white omelets. Look at that.
(To himself) Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over there? It's not like somebody died. It's "Beaches" for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't.
(tapping the spatula while waiting for waffles to be done) Any second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready.
She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.
All right. Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot. (hangs up)(to George) Casting tomorrow at NBC. 400. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful. (George looks disappointed)
So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.
Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...
I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.
We cold play Sorry! We cold play Steal the Old Mans Bundle. (Vanessa not amused; Jerry thinking) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to Vanessa) What kind of perfume is that youre wearing?
No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.
Especially that big kid up in the front. (Mr. Pitt is shown on the television, trying to hold up the deflating Woody balloon.) How old is he? (The phone rings.) Hello?
(Reading it) "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." - What is that?
You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake.
Hey, were kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?
All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a specimen.
Well, I am sure I had a good reason.
(answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.
It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse "ha's." You know those?
No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.
I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.
Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isnt that child abuse?
Yeah. You know, kind of a peace offering. Cute.
(Confirming) An alliance. (They both shake hands and laugh evily) Now get the hell outta here. (Newman leaves)
The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.
Happy camper , I don't hear that expression enough.
Yeah! I got it . It's in the apartment, but we can't go in there it's being fumigated.
I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
... as long as one of them is not him.
(stopping them) We better not. (they make out some more; then stop) T-They're gonna be here any second.
And she wants to break up with you..
So were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.
He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.
"Hey! Hey! Watch it.!... You're drooling all over the floor. How much Novocaine did that guy give you."
Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?
I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.
Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.
Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?
These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you?
Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. (Hands over Kramer's quilt.)
Oh my god. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops!
I don't know, this? (Shows his neck to Sara.)
Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?
You're not qualified to work at the catalog.
Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.
Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?
I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.
Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.
We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!
(Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.
..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.
You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!
Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.
Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh...
Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --
So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.
Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one.
No. So, we're still on to see uh, Firestorm tonight?
It's okayit's just a hot dog, (still sobbing) everything is going to be okay.
I think I offended the wake-up guy...! (worried)
I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.
Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count on me! (hangs up)
So what's going on with Simon? Did he leave?
But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.
(sarcastically) Yeah, Levine. And Im Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.
Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drakes coffee cake
No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car.
You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.
George, I am loving this no wallet thing.
That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no--
You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.
Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.)
I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!
It's not even my car, it's a rental.
Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally, yeah this is Jerry,I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and..
But you know... not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me.
(to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?
Well, it couldnt be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president James Polk!" (ELAINE had echoed "Uh-huh. Yup." during it)
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.
(scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.
Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.
How late are the stores open? Im thinking of maybe uh, buying a new TV and smash it over my head.
Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary.
Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.
Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.
You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?
No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.
I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So(throws away belt) thats it!
Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.
All right take it easy, just take it easy.
He's a boy who lives in a bubble.
Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You got it ALL wrong. I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoans
(thinking) Yeah, thats normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?
If you need more time, you should have more time.
Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?
Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.
....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant? Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it in there by helicopter, you know keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. "We got the hair but I think we lost the Zest." ....rejects the transplant with organs. Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . Guy just standin' there and suddenly... ..Bink! ( motions hair flying out of his head)........lands in someone's frozen yogurt.
Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.
Listen to this "I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."
On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!
You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West? Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.
Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day.
George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!
I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.
...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.
Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.
Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is.
Ma, I told you, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan... Okay, bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Rava) My mother. She forgot how to make French toast. You know how mothers are.
Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.
(yelling) Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.
I *just* learned that. (proudly holding the Yo-Yo)
And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
(determined) I wanna join. I need it to become a member.
(defensive) At least it was just the handle!
So what? A lot of older men have that.
(in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room) Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad, you look so different.
You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.
(scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.
I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous!
The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. "Who was that clown?", "I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?", "The guy's a clown!". How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, "What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!"
I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.
Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.
(shaking his head no) No Kramer I don't want to talk to him.
I'm sorry, Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen)
All right, all right. (trying on the suit jacket)
You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!
Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.
[with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?!
Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?
Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?
Let me see those. ( smells them) Oh! I know the chunky that left these Chunkies......NEWMAN!!! I've got him.
Ah, you know. Im supposed to meet, eh, someone -- Ill, Ill wait for them outside. (walks towards the door)
Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?
I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!
George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'
(picking at his moustache) You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.
I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.
Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.
Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?
Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.
But you gotta know how to work the projector.
Well, just give it back, and I wont say anything.
You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!
That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?
Hey Kenny. (with some fake enthusiasm, just to be polite)
Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there.
I think it has something to do with me.
No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.
I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, "Oh This is so good. What's in it?" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not.
Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.
(Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 'French Impressionist Paintings'?
Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's better than eating it.
You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.
Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger.
I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.
Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!
I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? "Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!"
Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.
Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts.
Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.
But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?
Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?
Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser.
Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!
He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?
Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD.
I saw one once that could do sign language.
We're here discussing our script with your father.
(grimaces and takes the shovel back) I'll dig.
[not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]
George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long.
Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)
I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.
That was a one in a million Mohel.
okay , bye (to George) What happened , did you take it off?
Oh I'm stressed! (makes like Kramer, outstretching his arm. Jerry heads for the freezer for some ice cream.)
Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.
(for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.
No body said youre fat. Hes a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy.
Uhn-uh-uhn - Uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer A-Ha ha! Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe. (singing) dee, de-de, de-de-de-de-de (Makes G.I. Joe swim off, legs kicking)
Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door behind him)
Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?
Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time.
Hey you know we were just talking about you.
Well my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.
(answering machine) Leave a message. I'll call you back. Thanks.
Yeah thats a good deal -- you win the Pennant with that trade, hair for phlegm.
(dialing) He got em out of the house.
Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.
Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something.
So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?
Well, her belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) Im bored. Talk to me.
(reaching into his pocket) Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for it.
It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.
If I told you, you woulda given it away.
I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it.
Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?
Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited.
What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.
Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?
Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore...
Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!
He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.
I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.
What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't respect salad eaters.
H-Hey, Kramer, wait up. I'll go with you.
Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.
Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test.
But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.
Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please.
(Stopping him) No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!
Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
(examining the label) Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.
Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.
Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?
You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!
No he's going downtown to guard the suit.
What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I would've done, if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!!
I will, I just walked in the door.
Let me have a look at this thing.
I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.
Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of?
Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--
Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.
Yes it will, now give me those keys!
And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?
You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.
Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.
(thinking) Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?
I mean, every time I see him, it's Tony this, Tony that. George is like a school girl around him
Doesnt think anyone can tell. So cmon, do we have a deal?
No, we don't care, we just want to go.
all right lets be reasonable, Bania. Im taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal.
Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,
I don't know if they have land guys.
