Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.
Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.
And where does it end? Then everyones doin it. Its like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, "Dont go there." - Someones gotta take a stand!
Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign.
Well. This should be a very interesting evening.
Oh, you want to try the syrup! (Meryl smiles and takes it. The waitress comes over.)
She might be. She's the star of the show.
Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go?
Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.
(taking off his jacket) Slaughtered. Wiped the floor with 'em and (hanging up jacket) not only that, the money was unbelievable.
Oh No, wait a second... Wait a second... I-I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name.
Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.
Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.
I never should have made up those rules.
You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?
Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!
Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.
What I said. Ive been under a lot of stress.
What the hell...? Why is the door open?
Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender! (an event guard stops them)
So, um, do you date uh immature men?
(looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!
...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code.
Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I cant ask her.
(looking over the list) Hmm ah. I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?
Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a One-woman show?
yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas..
I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce you get impeached and you're not even the president!
Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.
Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, "Make sure you hang on to your jacket."
To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.
Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
(Scolding) George. (To salesman) Sorry, were just waiting for David Puddy.
(To himself) I don't believe this! (Walks over to a security guard) Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with shoplifting..
So Marcelino's going to take down the check?
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
Oh, what do you think? I found it at the back of my closet.
(on the phone) Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Ya. Oh, really? Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye. (hangs up the phone) Well, the yogurt verdict is in. (Kramer looks at Jerry with his arms out) Fat!
Hell have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.
Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. I'm being audited.
They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record.
(as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.
No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.
Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, Im in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants.
Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.
Who would order a license plate that says "Assman"?
Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen?
I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?
(To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. (Gestures to a black Saab)
Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane enters)
But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.
Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?
Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
Look, you can hang out here if you want.
It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.
Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?
I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. "Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life." Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, "I had a heart attack this big (Holds out hands, gesturing bigness) ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear! (Puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest) Brrhht.. and it's gone!"
It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)
Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.
So I finally get to meet your pal Joey.
Let's get outta here. [to Buckles] I'll see ya.
Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?
(in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.
Um, who do I make it out to?
Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.
Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?
Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.
Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.
Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand.
Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one.
Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.]
Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?
All right, she said she couldnt find a decent hotel room...
Keep following him Kramer. don't let me down.
It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.
Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.
Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad.
I'll tell you what happened. We got married.
I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.
Yeah, that's a deal. That's a terrible deal. I don't want to go out to dinner with him. Id rather make my own suit.
(Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! A dinosaur!
Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.
Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people?
How much could you possibly have in there?
Yea, ya, so...anyway what was I talking about.
And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.
Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.
Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.
So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner?
Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.
You asked a date to go to the operation?
Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.
I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!
What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?
He was down at the other end. So he yells out, "Ready, On your mark, Get set, " and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.
No, George was there, he said he had a great time.
All right now you listen and you listen good! (he grabs Kramer's legs and throws him down the couch)
Oh yeah? I dont believe youve seen... this.
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!
I think I heard her say something about a bench.
Kramer , there's no way you're sleeping with me.
What are you bringing snowballs in here for?
Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?
Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing.
Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?
You're out of your mind you know that.
You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs.
It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman.
(Looking down at the shirt; mumbling) Oh, thank you.
So, are you gonna go out with her?
.. and uh, underwear and a tee shirt.
Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.
The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like youre always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. Youre out somewhere with people, Gee, you look pregnant.. are you? Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, thats not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Lets take this whole scene again. People, think about what youre saying!
I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping.
But then we would have missed the whole thing.
Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.
(Making nothing of it) So? Who cares about that?
No. The police have no leads (sitting on the couch arm) and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.
You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?
Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.
I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.
(reading on) "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-"
No, no. Its not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, its not like Marlenes a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, weve had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling. (George nods.) And its these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if Im busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and shes in the middle of a sentence!
No, I don't wanna see the naked people.
Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?
Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.
No, no, no. I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.
Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late.
She'll have a cup of coffee and a broiled chicken.
(Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!
Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.
(To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.
All right, that's enough of that. (Jerry takes the plates and hands them to a waitress.)
I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?
Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll watch 'em go slice this fat bastard up. (sips coffee)
Many times. You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet.
(To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!
Come on. Then you dont have to see him again til my 15,000-mile check.
Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!
You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?
What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like it?
Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?
He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.
He never heard of corduroy! True story, true story.
You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it)
Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.
Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?
I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.
I said pull over by the stop sign.
Shes limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.
Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. (Holds lettuce head) Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts the intellect, represented here (Pulls off tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large piece) Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats tiny piece of lettuce)
Great. One of the best jobs I ever had.
Is that guy still there? (They are side-on to Phil who is in the background, still pressed against the glass, aghast)
Well, you know what they say. Lucky in love, Unlucky with fruit.
Does it ever bother you that this organization-
I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.
How do you get all that wood in here?
Ah, here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) Mmm, delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some.
Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye. (hangs up the phone; turns to Kramer) You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.
You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.
See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.
(Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not.
(on the phone) hey Andre, get the hell off the phone!
Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity.
Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...
yeah, it's a damn shame, a damn shame!
What are you gonna do about the roommate?
Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.
No don't do this. You're not doing this. I will fight you. No you don't... No.
Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.
I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .
No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car.
Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.
George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?
Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.
Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.
Oh and I've got some things of yours here.
He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in.
No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything off me, first laughs now ladies.
(Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.
Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...
(re-entering) Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again, are you?
I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.
What if he doesn't call now out of spite?
All right. You know this girl Clare I am seeing?
You're lying! You got it, I want that number!
I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?
Although what if its one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?
That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice.
That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?
Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.
Oh! but I do. There's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar. ( as he says this Newman is wildly scratching behind his back. he suddenly stops when Jerry turns around)
Why would I freak out? (To himself) Pilot...
(Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?
Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.
And who were you tryin to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?
Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?
"They get all emotional , they sway. It's embarrassing."
Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.
That's what a gym teacher once told me.
Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without.
I feel terrible. (Kramer smiling) I mean, Ive seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I cant go any further, but... Shes just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I cant breathe. Its like a drug.
So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out Im giving you a raise.
(taking the envelope) Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em.
So, she got you to join a book club?
(sharp) I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.
Sure. (points at booth) How about this one?
Fourteen years down the drain. (points and walks off -- to the bathroom)
Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me...
Ya, that's the.. last thing you want to see. Well, next to last.
You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.
Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted.
George, here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?
Ow. Stupid fold-out! Why'd they put the bar in the middle of the bed?
What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like theyre trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?
Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet?
I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.
What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?
Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.
I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes.
Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.
Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.
Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a person could still make a mistake like that.
I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!
Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.
(incredulous) You asked her to move in with you?
I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight.
How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? Wha, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just sit there going, "Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh, no, another headcase!"
(As George sits down) George, we need to talk.
You know you're not supposed to drink while you're keeping a secret! (Elaine laughs) Is there anything else?
I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?
(to the phone) Hello? (disappointed) Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) No. Uh, I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesnt know anything. Hes just my next-door neighbor. Uh, nothing much... Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. Im meeting somebody... Uh, Wednesday? Wednesdays okay... All right. Uh, Im a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning?... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone.
I'm not talking about upside down. (Jean-Paul and Kramer come in) I'm talking about waking him up!
Oh, Okay (turns to rest of table) Im sorry, I didnt know what to bring, nobody told me.
The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.
Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..
Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)
Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!
Don't you see what's goin' on here???... No boxers, no Jockeys...
No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.
Okay, fine. (Jerry takes a coin from his pocket.) This is the official flip. No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and thats it. Agreed?
The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.
(surprise) You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building too?
Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)
First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.
No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?
Well, I am sure I had a good reason.
Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.
What, What is this? What is she doing here?
I would like to propose a toast....Wait a second.. George! George Costanza come in here.
And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone.
Hey, look at the high score--"G.L.C." George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?
I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.
So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is better?
(to the phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)
Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..
Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!
I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.
Come on. Something's on your mind. Out with it.
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.
When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers.
Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door)
This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.
Well, the mans an individualist  he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what hes doing.
Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back
I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.
Of course, I stink, you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks..
Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?
So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head.
I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.
OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you know you are always welcome in my home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story.
Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now?
No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?
Well, its a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.
What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?
Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)
I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles.
(pause) If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?
A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?
(applying paste to brush) Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?
(Over the phone) Elaine, youve got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin me on this car, which is yellow now!
Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.
Fine all done, just looking for the soap.
Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.
This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?
Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?
So it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato.
I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.
What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!
The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?
I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.
All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.
I was kind of um (pauses) making out.
All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?
Well yes I did that's true. A couple of a guys I knew in the coastguard told me about her.... and I sensed that she had the anger and intensity that I needed to make this film work.
So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?
Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)
Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--
Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.
Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie.
It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.
This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.
See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey George, look, I'm not funny now.
(sarcastically) Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.
Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.
Excuse me. (Gets up and answers the door.) Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!
I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home.
I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?
Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?
Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.
Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.
Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.
I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are gonna be so sorry!
I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.
(thinking) Yeah, thats normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?
Well, we've got to do something. (grabs his phone) I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.
(To Assistant) Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.
(hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman.
Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain.
I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!
Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.
Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.
You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.
Oh, Im sorry. Im just waiting for someone.
You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?
Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.
No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman.
He was buying quite a load of chicken, almost for two people ...
Yeah, and, (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly exiting) time.
I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?
Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!
You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?
August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress! She never changes! Oh my god. (looking around) She's gotta have hundreds of these dresses.
Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.
Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.
Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little longer)
What do you care? You don't believe in hell.
Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.
Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life.
Yeah Ive got this old bottle of cough medicine.
Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.
Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.
Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California!
What was I supposed to do? You knew I was on my first date with Elaine. You come barging in here asking me to contribute money for a volcano relief fund for krakatoa.
I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?
Oh, o.k. (Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.)
Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.
Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.
No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman anything you say she does!
Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.
You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us.
Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!
Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them.
(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
(uncertain) Don't you hire people to do that?
(thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.
George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!
You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?
Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish...
Hello is this Alicia? .This is Jerry Seinfeld.
Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus.
What could possess anyone to throw a party? I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.
...I got you an apartment in this building.
Okay, Okay, I promise. (puts on the headphones again) Wow!!! Oh Man...Oh God.. Oh Brother....Whoooaaaa!! Whoaaaa (Elaine enters he takes them off rapidly)
Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that.
That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no--
Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.
All right. How 'bout this one let's say you're abducted by aliens.
So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.
Oh no, where's the blood? (opens the fridge) It's in here isn't it?
Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.
I don't know. Who could've been in my apartment.
Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?
A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?
Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... Im sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if...
So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.
Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.
What did you do the rest of the day?
To a guy you've never met? (mild sarcasm) Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous.
Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.
Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.
Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off.
Pull yourself together. Your going in there soldier! That's an order!
So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.
What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.
You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown?
Of course she doesnt have five thousand dollars!
Sex, thats meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; thats heavy. Thats like an hour.
Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.
Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?
I can't go until I find my cufflinks.
Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh?
You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here. Mike Wichter. He sold plastic straws. You know the ones? You could bend them.
I was ready to get jiggy with it.
Well, either you see him or you don't.
Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.
But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?
Krame? Sein. What are you doing? Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island. What are your thoughts about taking a ride? You sure? Okay, but don't leave me hanging here. Okay, great. Let me give you directions.
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!
Why don't you see what you can do?
By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.
I think that would be a very nice gesture.
Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that?
No, no, no, another race - out of the question.
Uhm, hold, hold on a second. (pauses counting) I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.
Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?
Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.
Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.
Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers?
You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.
(to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...
I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.
The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.
No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him.
Yes you do. That's what you both think.
Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerrys office. (Elaine is looking confused). Were going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean hes already left?
Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.
Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
(scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.
I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?
No in a matter of fact it isn't.
He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.
Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'
Well what am I supposed to do now?
Hey, I thought you went to the game.
All right, forget it, its over, Im not moving.
Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" or, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" You emphasize "Jerry" or "bring."
I know nothing, but what did you actually do?
Come on up. (Jerry presses the second button and opens the apartment door. He walks back to the couch.) Oh, all right, forget it, Im gonna take it with me now... (He picks up the cushions.) Im just gonna pack up the cushions right now...
That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.
"Just one....gotta go back.....Oh but get this. Elaine, you will appreciate this. I'm sitting in Tim Whatley's waiting room...He's got a Penthouse right out on the table."
tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.
That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow. It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.
Y-You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set!
Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.
George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.
Oh! There coming to town tomorrow by the way.
The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves)
Ill call Kramer. He can check my house.
Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.
(accusing) You're not wearing a shirt, are you?
I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodations. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats.
Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...
Its raining? Its raining. The game will be postponed. Well play tomorrow.
Yeahhh, am I imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and holds it up to Willie) Found this little cutie in the pocket. (throws the stub on the counter)
Oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh that's terrific... Mulva.
Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?
Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.
They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys.
Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.
Sex... to save the friendship. (Elaine drops her bag, takes off her jacket and walks into Jerry's bedroom) Well, if we have to (un-tucks his shirt) we have to.
SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?
(Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?
Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?
Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.
All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now, be reasonable you cannot turn down $50 for a $6 rye.
Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm.
Well, I just want you to know I'm there for you. Course now I'm here for you, but when i'm not here for you, i'm there for you.
Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.
Yep. Since college. (Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.) Hey, Lena Small's on this list.
One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub.
Everyday is my birthday. (Sarcastically joking off what George said)
Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.
I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.
(still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.
Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally, yeah this is Jerry,I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and..
So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did?
I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.
Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.
Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.
Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?
Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.
Kramer!? (grabbing Kramer's arm roughly, pulling him back as he's about to knock)
You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do.
Should I get it? I hate these moments. Im hearing the dual voices now, you know, What about the money? Whats money?
No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage?
Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else.
Non-fat yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it.
(stands, puzzled, it's not sinking in) W-what do you mean?
(In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so.
You don't even know what a write off is.
Hang on just let me pick up a paper.
(playing Scrabble with his naked girlfriend) Zephyr? That is not a word.
Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.
Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.
Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard.
This is insane. You know, I dont even know where shes staying! She, shes not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.
George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.
(thinking) Thank you, Pamela! (turns to talk to Vanessa; to Vanessa) So, youre a lawyer...
Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.
Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.
It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.
I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.
Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Uh, gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. Alright let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... (looks at Joe; Joe gives him a weird look)ooo, just right... and three plantains uh ought to do it.
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?
Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?
That's the last babka. They got the last babka.
Oh! Come om . He'll be over there for a half hour, he gets lost over there. C'mon so what is this about?
Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy.
Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you.
(to Kramer and Morty) What is this about?
Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino.
Whats to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.
Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for?
I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.
And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?
What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty minutes of 'So, who's from out of town?'
Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.
I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.
Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.
No, you stay here in the car. I may need you.
What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog.
Well, I got to talk her out of this.
You cannot buy half a can of soda.
Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't get any oxygen.
I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.
How long has your car been sitting in the Yankee parking lot?
Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.)
I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.
All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.
It's a movie stub from the 930 show. George, I think Willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes.
Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I dont feel comfortable in them.
Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting.
So I know this guy. Im getting all my sneakers at a discount now.
Id really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.
Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend.
You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?
Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?
Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.
Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)
Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason.
Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.
Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected, outwardly.
(Singing) Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!
I think what he's trying to say is, "get the bouilla-base." (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)
Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from ourselves. That's what you said.
How did you lock your keys in the car?
This stuff on top is my friends. Could I get it done in a separate machine?
(noticing Alec Berg walk in, whispers) Hey, Alec!
Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!
Well if he's going then I'm not going.
Hey...I'm not stupid. I'm looking in that drawer, there's no can opener.
It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look (searches for word) stupid. (to salesman) I'm sorry.
So you don't cry when your grandmother dies? But a hotdog makes you lose control?
The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?
She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.
Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.
(Threatening tone) So, listen, Puddy. When we first started this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you want to play hard ball, I got my friend, George, here, and he can play pretty hard ball. (Leaving the negotiation to George) George, vein it up.
Evry-Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. "Oh, is he good?" "Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best." They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, "You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. No, he's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher." And then there's always that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me." Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, "Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. And everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."
They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives.
I don't know. So what's this job of yours?
Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?
Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door behind him)
Could you make a little more noise? (To his parents) Listen, I'm gonna have to call you later.
I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.
If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!
Oh my god, he knows. (Jerry and Gino scrambling) Go. (yelling to the door) One second.
What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?
Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.
My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didnt want to move to Florida, but theyre in their sixties, and thats the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old peoples house with a golf cart, jump out, Lets go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. Drop it! I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversations so boring. Its so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, What if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass. You know. Come back in, theres broken glass, everybodys all upset. No, Im all right. I was just a little bored there. And uh no, Im fine. I came back. I wanted to hear a little more about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Lets pick it up right there.
Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.
It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.
Naw, I gotta wait until its just the right time.
Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.
You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?
I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.
You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.
C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one.
No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.
You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.
Ma, you cant look up words in the dictionary! (to Morty) Dad, shes cheating!
Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.
And you want to be my latex salesman.
Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.
So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?
So he just shaves his head for no reason?
What, do you think I care about the money? Is that what you think? You want me to show you what I care about money? Here look, here look at this, here's a dollar here look, there, that?s how much I care about money.
Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it They're roommates. She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back. She's not gonna do that.
Hey, ??? is rerunning the Yankee game. You watching this?
And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.
(unheard by Jenna) When the battery runs out.
Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.
Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's leftovers.
George what the hell are you doing over there? I told you to mind your own business now stay out of my affairs!
You're going to make a good father someday.
Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. (Hands over Kramer's quilt.)
You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!
Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh, Ketchup? Pretty name for a girl.
(Unsure of what to say - he remember's Leo's courtesy tip) Hello?
Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...
No, I don't want that smell in the house.
But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.
Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while.
No move. So, you see, its all part of a divine plan.
Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump across.
How much money is this gonna cost me?
I dont get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?
(While digging in his pocket for some money, he looks over the shirts one last time) You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt..
Well, theyre three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.
Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)
No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking.
By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine)
So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.
They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing."
Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will.
Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. (They both walk to the booth and sit down. Suddenly, Gwen is attractive) Now this is a good looking booth.
So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil
Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?
He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.
What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must be something. What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks?
It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.
(a la "Don Corleione") Elaine, never ask me about my business!.... (SHEEPISH) "Godfather."
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?
Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner?
See...women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel...
It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?
Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!
Well, it was the best of those movies.
...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either.
(picking at his moustache) You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.
(thinking) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft... (to Vanessa) Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit.
Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.
(George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party?
Shes right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, Im gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.
It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go. (to old man that enters) It was GEORGE!
That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.
Hey, not bad. (pointing to crest) I kinda like this little thing here.
Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and find my number.
Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.)
You dont think it mightve had anything to do with that?
Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.
I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!
Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?
(pointing to napkins; to Elaine) Could I get napkin over there?
I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.
Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone? You wanted the machine. You know, and you're always kind of thrown off, (left hand up to side of face, pretending its a receiver) you go "Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you."
I don't understand. What don't you like about it?
(on phone) Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil.
She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.
Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this.
No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.
Oh my God is that the new perfume?
I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.
Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we play one for all the marbles?
Oh I dont know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing.
(walking out) Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody.
Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.
Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.
40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
Oh, I know her. I know her type.
All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.
Yeah but theres a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet.
I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didnt want to talk to, I could go, Excuse me, Im not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away. I also have a cordless phone, but I dont like that as much, because you cant slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone  You cant talk to me like that! Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone  You cant talk to me like that!
Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.
I don't think I can be that nice.
What happened to the jacket. Did he take it with him?
See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup...
Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I?m the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me!
(to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? (wondering what the hell's Kramer doing)
Oh Yeah we went way out and wild.
Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for membership.
Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?
It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.
And I don't want you to hold mine!
Im a guy  it always looks like that.
Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)
He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it.
I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.
Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.
Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!
Of course not, if I did would you have gone?
Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.
What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.
(eating pop corn) hmm I love this artificial flavoring I like it better than butter I think it's more consistent
Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!
If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.
When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their face, you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going with somebody.
Super bowl! Hey, an original G.I. Joe. (picks up both items) With a full frogman suit.
Oh! Come on, you told them you're from out-of-town just so you could stay in a hotel room.
(waving the key) You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!
Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?
(Kramer waddling out the door) Maybe you can soak in the tub.
And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table)
Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.
Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?
Seth! Wow what has it been like five years?
Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!
For crying out loud, He's Superman. (Fulton stops laughing, Jerry's face is stunned) Fulton? (looks at him) Fulton?
Got 'em on the street, from a scal... (catches himself again)
Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! No!!! Thank you. (Hangs up.) I don't believe this. They've added Bania to the network showcase and he's going on right after me.
Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.
(to George) Did you call me a wuss?
You really used to have a think full head of hair.
You see the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around, but they don't know they're ugly, because nobody actually tells them.
The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.
You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But its really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesnt it? "I really am a doctor you know. You think Im not, just check it out." I dont know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. "Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and Ill give you my opinion." After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what theyre talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants.
They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?
Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested)
So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist. You just called the woman for a date.
20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.
Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.
Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee.
Uhn-uh-uhn - Uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer A-Ha ha! Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe. (singing) dee, de-de, de-de-de-de-de (Makes G.I. Joe swim off, legs kicking)
You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.
(is redialing) I should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.
She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here. (pointing up and down at George)
Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!
(Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.
"Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!"
Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?
What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha ha!
What about this? This is blood isn't it?!
I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...
I don't know him. I know who he is.
AH. Yes that's gonna make a big difference.
The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.
Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?
Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.
George, who is that woman in the stripes?
There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
(Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.
I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.
Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.
Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --
Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!
Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. (Kramer goes to get the suit. Elaine enters.)
Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?
She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.
I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight....
(looks in the creamer) Theres no milk in here, what...
Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.
So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth? (Elaine laughs silently)
Nice Mohel picking, Elaine. You picked a helluva Mohel!
Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up.
Oh, the sisters (he sits at the table)
(thoughtful) Hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey, there it is.
Come on! I know it's something you wanna do! (she pulls harder and he falls right off the table)
Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! (runs back to his seat) Bad lighting on the porch.
Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania)
Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend.
I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.
I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?
I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
(stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem?
No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!
You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.
Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why dont we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. (All three sit down) Now, look, you both find each other attractive, right?
No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.
What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him? I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he?
I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door...
We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.
Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.
Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up.
You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
(Smiling, like a salesman) All right. Now, what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today?
Im Jerry, Elaines friend, and this is George.
Who do I know who would have even been in a limousine yesterday anyway. Uhh-O h-owow!
(Interrupting Bania) Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.
Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!
That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.
Look I really don't know what they're plans are.
This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!
I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?
(struggling to open a bottle with his bandaged finger) I can't do it. (A LA GODFATHER) Look what they did to my boy, They massacred my boy.
Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.
(sits on the back of the couch) Oh my god.
We dont understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you cant stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I dont see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, lets make up our mind where we think theyre going.
No, I dont think so. Ive seen you two together. You make each other miserable. Its kismet.
The bad fianc&Mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...
Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?
What causes homophobia? What is it, that makes a heterosexual man, worry? I think it's because, men know, that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, "Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'"
Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour.
Hmm, I really need to speak with him.
So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.
It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it.
I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there.
Come on, take them. You could take Bonnie.
(answering) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Um, its for you.
Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser.
Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?
Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?
Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How many of those did we go to?
Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...
No, its, its just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it. (Jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) Ten-fifteen... No, dont be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, its no trouble at all... Ill see you tomorrow... Great, bye. (He hangs up the phone; to Kessler) I dont believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here!
Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isnt that child abuse?
Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad it's Klompus.
A few stitches? I've never had stitches. I'll be deformed. I can't live with that. It goes against my whole personality. It's not me!
Well, maybe he doesn't have a "get outta here" kind of personality.
(rising) I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the speed-dial.
I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!
Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!
I don't need a personal trainer. (Kramer comes in) all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.
I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" thing.
There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. (Miss Rhode Island laughs.)
Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.
(Jokingly playing off Kramer's statement) With a different body.
So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?
Well my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.
Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.
Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard-working Americans!
Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing?
Could you at least get a hat for me?
Let me explain something to you. You see, youre not normal. Youre a great guy, I love you, but youre a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldnt understand.
What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.
(Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?
Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?
Since when are you treating me to medicine? What are you doing? You're stealing this, aren't you?
Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches)
What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I would've done, if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!!
Uh, you don't have to take a picture.
Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.
Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. Im sure theyd just as soon give it to you, but youd have to come up with that money.
Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so fuck(bleeped)ing good.
Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign.
(walking out) Thanks for having me over, guys.
All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar).
So he just gets soup. He wants to save the meal. So now I got to do it all over again.
(opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.
He was in the shop. I thought you told me he wasn't going to be there.
No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.
Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.
What? (Kramer hands Jerry an envelope) My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it?
'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.'
Is that your "chicken" making all that noise?
All right, I'll call 911. Think he did it? Could've he done it? Couldn't done it? How could've he done it? Couldn't be? Could it? Hello 911? How are you? I'm sorry it was just a reflex...I know it's an emergency number...it is an emergency...my friend is being accused of being a smog strangler and I know he didn't do it...they're putting me trough to the detective in charge of the investigation...what is my name? Who am I? I'm eh...George Costanza...
They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.
And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's pretty sick.
Damn, I was too overanxious, he must have noticed that.
Elaine is having a "houseguest." She's picking him up at the airport tonight.
So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry?
It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.
All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.
Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later.
Can you relax, its a cup of coffee. Claire is a professional waitress.
Yeah, but why would you... (Kramer is eating a peach then disgusted he spits it out) Bad peach?
That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it. (throws watch in garbage)
No, I do not like the bank. Ive heard the expression Laughing all the way to the bank. I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when theres nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, its empty and you still have to go through the little maze. (walking on the stage like he is going through a maze) Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? Im almost at the front. Id like a reward for this please.
You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back.
I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.
In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.
Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem.
Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.
Oh. like they wouldn't have found that anyway.
So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night...
Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. You had to give him a box of cigars.
Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog strangler. (George leans close) would you suck a mint or something. Can I come right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where we are. Where are we?
. . . All right (gritting teeth) Just give me the ticket.
I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.
(putting the phone back to his ear) Yeah.
Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?
You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.
No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.
I gave you a taste. What do you want?
No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls.
I got your message, (sitting) so I came straight from Atlantic City.
Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener - what other conclusion could one reach? (The phone rings.)
So she tought I did it to get back at her
Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?
No social reason for them to be here.
Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.
They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What do they look like."
Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. (Faint) I don't care about that.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON UP (Jerry puts his head down - he's not looking forward to Kenny Bania)
Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.
No. We gotta go to the soup place.
Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.
Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!
Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, Ill see ya.
Oh, great! Alright. (We hear the announcers calling the game.)
It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination. I would have killed this man. Torn him limb from limb, ripped the flesh right off his bones ...
We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men.
I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?
Well it?s very flattering. How did you get these tickets, I heard they're impossible to get.
'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?
(to Elaine, still joking) He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!
Yeah. (hands racquet to Kramer) I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it.
Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?
I didnt know what the coma etiquette was.
Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.
Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment for two days. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my parents. they'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own I'm sure it's gonna be some awful dump. Wait a second.. Have you checked in The Plaza yet?
Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days!
What you must understand, Elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) Youve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.
Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?
(to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?
Great, its yours. I can't stand the sight of it. Elaine, heres the car keys. (tosses her the keys)
Im just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.
I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!
Alright, but let me ask you this question.
Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something.
Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.
I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.
Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.
Hey, guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!
Oh, I cant begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.
So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything.
Thirty-six. What's the signal? Howbout this? Chicken wing? No, no, no, I got a better one. Head patting.
But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.
You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.
Aw! You'll be fine, you were in there for what , a couple of minutes.
(long pause -- did he hear "ridicurous" -- should he say something -- can't decide if he should. Finally...) Did you say, "ridicurous"?
So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?
We make all these plans - this idiot goes a hundred miles an hour - the whole weekend's over - incredible - just like that -
Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?
Sure, Beth, these things happen. (Brief pause) So, have you told many.. people yet?
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.
Yeah. (Kramer sits in the seat next to Jerry) Uh, uh, oh, oh, Over there. (points to the next seat over)
No, it's a nine-hundred S. (happy) It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo!
The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. "Who was that clown?", "I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?", "The guy's a clown!". How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, "What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!"
Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?
Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!
Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car!
No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.
Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.
Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. (George laughs) So, when do you move into the apartment?
(Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together?
Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.
(Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.
That is so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood horse?
What's happening? What, you doing, come and talk to us.
Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.
The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.
Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner.
You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?
(Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.
Let's go out and celebrate! (they all get up)
Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.
I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.
I'll call back, thank you. (hangs up the phone) He went to South America!
Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. He's a punk, a patsy, a hack.
She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass.
That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.
Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.
Yeah, uh, Ok, uh, tomorrow uh, where da ya - where do you live, uh, up town? Upper west side?
Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
I think I saw one a coupla doors down.
I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to Jack)
Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, "Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land." (Imitates cannon operator) "I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you."
Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.
Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?
Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met!
It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?
(pulling Leo back in) Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you.
(to George) No. (to Kramer) I told you not to say anything.
Youre gonna get back together, anyway. Its thousands of dollars!
Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?
Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!
No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.
(holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the fridge?
Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.
Elaine? How did you rope her into this?
Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?
Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?
Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?
Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. (Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks at Kramer.)
I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you?
Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.
Oh. yeah. Alright. (pushes Kramer and Elaine out the door, then sits next to Sidra on the couch.) So, where were we?
I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.
No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?
(Disgusted. To the woman) Oh, come on. You know he's a postman, don't ya?
Well thank you very much, it's about time.
Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!
It's Kramer isn't it? I knew it!  The greasy door knob the constant licking of the fingers, he's hooked to the chicken isn't he?
So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?
A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the dish and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit.
He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.
I didnt know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrants going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesnt make sense. Am I wrong?
What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
Get out of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The Heart Attack')
Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?
I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.
I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket)
Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order)
Elaine, George (introducing them to Bania with less enthusiasm)
But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
What did you have to give your TV away to George for?
You guys both have class at the same time?
No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station.
That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. (pointing at the umbrellas) What've you got in a push-button mini.
(Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!
Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count on me! (hangs up)
We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.
Yeah, Im going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days.
Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I would've asked her.
Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.
It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.
I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.
Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. >click click click<...
They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
(wiping his brow) He could use a couple laughs.
You know 'm just curious, How did you know she wasn't my girlfriend?
Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... what kind of a sicko would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide (small fingers opening imaginary drawers) Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT hard to get round black buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this? ... is it such a great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, you'll never find them - they save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they're going to fall off too that's the other thing ...
So, where do you want to eat tonight?
So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the Spokes model category?
Yeah, yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. Would you mind. I'd like to take the picture back.
I don't know, but you don't have it.
Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.
Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia, watching Jerry on TV. Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.
Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.
Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.
Hey come on, you're getting it all over the floor!
I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress.
Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.
Well, I have some money. What do you need? (pulls out some bills)
So I guess , you're not getting married?
Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.
So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.
Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral?
Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.
The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.
Alright. (Approaches host) Excuse me, this is your party, right?
Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
(pointing toward the guy) See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.
You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.
I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out.
You're still trying to gget that free sub?
So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club.
(Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key?
So tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?
I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?
Go look at your face in the mirror.
Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.
I kinda like this opera crowd, I feel tough... Anybody else got a problem?
Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...
The fabric of society is very complex George.
(looking after the guys) That nut is always up to something.
So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, hes thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, theres nothing left?
(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.
"I don't know how you can eat that spicy chicken,"
I mean that's fine if that's who you are...
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!
George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!
Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.
Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa.
From my house. I got a whole box of them.
Why dont they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, Just Back. All back; No front. You walk in the front, youre immediately in the back. (Jerry picks up a tie display, and shakes it rhythmically from left to right.) Look, Elaine, tie carwash.
Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?
(doubtful) I don't know, do you have a--
So what does he care if you put lifts in?
What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?
Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!
It has nothing to do with her sister.
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.
Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.
That was Elaine , she changed her mind. She's not coming over.
Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.
Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.
everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah?
Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?
All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.
Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?
I think that's a "what's good for the goose is good for the gander".
Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.
It's been three days and he hasn't called.
I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.
Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there.
Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.
Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time.
Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do?
Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.
So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.
Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
(derisively at Kramer) Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?
Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?
You know I dont get that whole suicide machine. Theres no tall buildings where these people live? They cant wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?
George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments.
Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.
There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?
Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...
(in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room) Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad, you look so different.
Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.
No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.
No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.
Let me have a look at this thing.
Yes. Hes a doctor. (Elaine starts to leave. ) Wait a second. (Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in Elaines purse.) (to George) What are you doing?
Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a little. .
We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.
That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.
No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 1030.
Course you may not see it for twenty years.
I cant believe this. So what are you saying? You didnt like my act, so thats it?
Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer, say it isn't so.
Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. (Rachel shocked)
More Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I don't even have any wood in the house!
(outraged) He's a doctor!.I mean it's supposed to be like a sterile environment."
So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.
(to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)
(to the Drake) So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome... (to Elaine) They loved the TV, *loved* it!
Oh, Hey, there's a name you don't forget.
You think they have fleas there, don't you?
Don't feel right? What are you talking about?
1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass!
No, no. Still doin the big sweep across.
Youre you. Were having lunch with Art Corvelay.
Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
(TO GEORGE, REWOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?
Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.
Did you at least get him a card?
An inch! Can you move over an inch?!?
(annoyed) All right. (after a pause) Hey, you know what's weird?
Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!
I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it.
What do you mean you don't think so?
No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.
The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.
Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is.
I hear you're going out with David Putty.
Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..
You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?
Is it...? Could it...? Could he have...? IT IS! (Grabs Kramer.) Poppie peed on my sofa!!
What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time
It was the single worst moment of my life.
What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him?
(interrupts)like a shark fisherman with a bucket of (?) Ch....
That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.
She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.
It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
You what? You passed? How could you do that?
Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh...
Oh no. Thats impossible. Id rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.
All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.
(facing the lengthening line behind him) Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.
Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.
All right, the whole elevator business, let me just explain-
You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while, no matter how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because they're crawling , crawling on your skin. Up your legs , up your spine , up your back.....
Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.
Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?
Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.
I dunno, watch it on TV I guess. Why?
Get in there. (he pushes George in the direction of the restaurant)
Oh. (chuckles) Really? You don't seem that desperate.
All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.
Hey. So, ah, Ramon this is my friend Elaine.
(Reasoning) You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place!
Listen, Joel. Theres something I have to tell you...
All right Ramon, Im going to get going.
(on the phone) Hello? No, Im sorry Bania ... Im not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye.
I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?
Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?
Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.
(after a very awkward pause, cheerily) Hey, neighbor.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.
Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!
Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye.
Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?
(for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.
(long pause).......Sure. ( humms a song then stares at the toothbrush)
Hey listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, why don't you have dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if you want, you know, have a little company, take the pressure off.
Well. (calling down the hall) Call if you're gonna be late!
Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--
Oh, man, look at this mess! You know what's gonna happen if they see this?
So as he's telling the story he starts crying.
I just got the most bizarre message from you father, Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!
How ya doing? (George nods) Can't talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his brace) Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his eyebrows) I like that. (George sticks his tongue out) So how's life without tonsils? (George quickly indicates with his arm that he wants ice cream) What? What's that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?.. (George signals that it's more) Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy.. (George motions for ice cream again) What are you doing?
Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.
You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?
Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it is. (vehement) Just take it!
Well, I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble.
(Giving Newman a sour look) I'm just hanging out in this hell-hole because of George.
Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.)
Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.
Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
Hey, when Im driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. Im always waving everybody in. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. ...All right. All right. Ill have a chicken salad.
There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it..
C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.
You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!
What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!
Ohh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands. So.. (Goes for his coat)
Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...
Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.
The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?
Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!
I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and Ill just make up some excuse why I cant go to the game either.
Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)
Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.
My stomach, I , think it was that cookie.
What you do say about a guy like this, huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. But your loyalty is beyond question.
Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.
Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.
I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.
(To Elaine) Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get some coffee.
Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in!
(Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.
Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number.
Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice?
Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!
Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it.
(Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?
George, I've been sick all week. Elaine was too. Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes. Do the math. Yeah, maybe I will get out. Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first. Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something. Yeah, Selwyn's. Okay bye.
Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you.
What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead.
Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen "Girlie" Brown would be very proud of you.
I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?
Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'
(Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do?
(quickly moves over toward Matthew) What the *beep*(fuck) are you doing? You little piece of *beep*(shit)!
Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house?
Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!
You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me.
I had a statue! What should I do?
(Like a little kid) But, I don't want to be a pirate!
What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again.
Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you.
Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?
No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.
(still watching tv; sounds like basketball) Bottle-wipe supercedes it.
Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!
Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.
Oh, no, uh, go ahead. You got a pen?
You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.
Well, we fight a lot for some reason.
I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal?
Oh! Rimsky -- great great book if I may say so sir. I almost read the whole thing.
Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?
Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?
(Stopping him) No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!
Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.
Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.
Really? (They start to make out, Jerry sees the pilot on the plane) Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!
No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.
Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order.
He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly . I would like to have a good show.
(Fed up) Alright! Excuse me! (Gets up) I'm not buying any of this!
I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.
Ohhh... You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.
$40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
Well, I didnt uh really mean a pony, per se...
Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.
No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?
I think he's the same age as the father.
Who was in town on a business venture, and um..
Elaine? What does she have to - (notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.) Oh no...
Well, You can't go in there it's like a gas chamber in there.
You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.
I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' (mimes throwing) 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?
Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!
I guess you can take anything, but actual work.
Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.
Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I-I just wanted to ask you a question when we we're going out did you have orgasms?... Okay, thanks... No that's it... Ya, Okay, bye.
12 gauge. Seems to be the most popular gauge.
No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.
If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, Im telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. Im sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.
Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.
Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs.
I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... (Jerry stops, and mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica on the phone at work.)
About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!
Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.
Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
If I like their race, how can that be racist?... Hellooo??... Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!... Yyy-yes, I am calling George... Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!
There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.
You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.
(pause) I don't know, they just tell you the night before.
Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.
I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket.
Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing. Perhaps it's an homage.
No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.
All right, lets go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.
So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was just wondering if there were houses there to rent.
Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
How about when Harrison Ford jumped out of that plane, and he was shooting back at them as he was falling?
Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.
I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect.
Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?
(back in booth) He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life.
I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!
Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.
Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.
I'm NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT! ..
Well, we need change and all I have is twenties.
I know. He got the hit in game SIX. So, so then what happened?
I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
(upset) Ohhhh, what are you doing? Kessler, its a tape! I taped the game, its one oclock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.
Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here!
Of course I want to talk about it.
Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.
(getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.
I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there.
Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.
Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president James Polk!" (ELAINE had echoed "Uh-huh. Yup." during it)
You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool.
You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.
I don't understand what the big deal is.
Are you sure he cant hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.
Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's.
Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?!
So what did you do there all day?
By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks.
Well its not like it's a really funny story or anything.
Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by the big showcase tonight.
I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that? (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying)
But they not you arent handicapped, arent you ashamed?
(interrupting) "Elaine , I really don't...............pay much attention to men`s faces."
That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. Its like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you doing today?
So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouth-to-mouth.
We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk.
Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.
It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.
So write a letter.. move to another...move to Staten Island., 'lot easier to blend in a sea of people in Staten Island than China believe me.
I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. "The New Yorker is stealing my ideas." ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real.
Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry won't let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesnt that bother you?
What? (to George) What did, what did you say?
Well, what kind of a kiss? Was it a peck? Was it a kiss? Was it a long make out thing?
You do of course try on, when you buy?
George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?
(Pointing) He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..
Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle?
Coincidence? This guys in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment?
I don't know what you should do with it.
I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.
Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 630 and gimme a call.
Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer.
Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.
. Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it
You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?
Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.
Of course I was getting you a note.
He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.
Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.
Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..
Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?
Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!
Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!
oh you're afraid he might look like Zippy the pinhead
Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school.
(to Kramer) It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Wheres she gonna get five thousand? She doesnt have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. Shes gone. Then you come in, Why dont you loan her five thousand? What do you care? Youve got five thousand. Give her five thousand!
Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!
All right, all right. Whats the big hubbub, bub?
Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something.
Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.
"Guys And Dolls"? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?
Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.
You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.
So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.
Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought.
They sealed him up with the mint inside.
It's like we're living in the '50s here.
But the question is, are you still master of your domain?
[with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?!
I cant. Shell get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.
You got toilet paper on your heel there.
Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?
What are you looking at? (Kramer goes out onto the terrace and looks down.) Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold.
Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!
I'm saying "get the hell outta there"! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call, Jean-Paul! A wake-up call!
What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasnt the one.
We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing.
The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.
Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!
Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city.
What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's - it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it, and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you. (Nodding)
Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing...
Well I guess if I?m the Miana I should go. All right, all right.
(smiling) Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.
Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!
Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off.
I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away)
I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.
I dunno , I'm gonna ask Shelley ,but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident.
No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.
What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?
Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
(Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?
If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.
Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.
But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?
So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.
So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.
Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here.
Its a list of excuses, its for that guy, Horneck, whos at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I dont have to see him. (Elaine laughs.) I need it. (Elaine starts writing on the list.) What are you doing?
If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like Lex Luthor.
Well, thats it. Look, Im going to Vermont. I dont want to think about this. Im selling.
Hey. Why didn't cha get the big one?
I think if ones going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. Its common courtesy. I dont know. Thats just the way I was brought up.
No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.
Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately.
Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention, Elaine laughs) Maybe it's time you got a different hobby.
What if hes in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (Jerry knocks on imaginary glass.) How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? (He makes a hissing sound.) By the way, whats happening with Sendrax?
Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.
Yeah, I blamed it on you. Hi Tim.
And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.
I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.
(to the Barneys sales associate) Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?
Either that, or theyve got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why dont you just go to the cashier?
I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?
Yes. I do. You show me where there's a can opener in that drawer. (Answers the phone.) Hello! I'm sorry, I'm just fighting with my wife.
This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.
Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.
Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.
She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.
I *just* learned that. (proudly holding the Yo-Yo)
Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?
I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)
No no come on really, get another one. Itll take a second.
(realising) Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. It belongs to the Friars Club.
Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--
Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents.
I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.
(Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that line?
Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?
Elaine its her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back.
Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles...
(in a hurry) Ya how you gonna get all this done in time?
Ramon, what are you doing here? You could get in trouble.
Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!
Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things about you from George.
To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in, in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in "morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? fine" Ten minutes later you see him in the hall, "How ya doin'?" Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow "Hey" You start coming up with nicknames for them. "Jimbo."
But if you go back with me , then I'm not.
Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them.
All right, sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) George?
That's funny, that's funny! "I'm sick of cleaning." That's very funny.
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?
George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality.
Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it.
And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.
Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.
My car? You drove it into the swamp!
Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!
Yea. (pulls at the t-shirt) This is Golden Boy's son Baby Blue.
Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.
A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.
They really should mention that in the breakdown height, weight, goiter.
(interrupts) I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.
No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first.
(Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them!
Would you turn that down! What is that crap!
If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.
Yes, I know youre not gonna do it. Thats why I bet.
I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around..
Wait 'til I tell him about the book.
Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.
Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.
Im getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other line beeps) Im getting another call, see ya(answers call) Hello!
She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. [sarcastically] I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... >click click< Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? >click click< I'm back...
A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?
All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a mnage  trois with her and her roommate.
No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.
well, you know, sometimes a square is everything
I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.
OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers?
Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?
Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy.
It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.
Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me.
You're cut off, you're out of the loop!
Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.
(Gesturing to Ellen) Kramer, George, this is Ellen.
Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.
If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.
Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.
(After seeing how much his parents like her) Now, I'm not so sure.
So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here.
I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.
Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. (standing) I'm going to the bathroom.
If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.
I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.
402? (Checks his wristwatch) Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup!
Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.
(still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.
Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!
I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.
I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--
Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.
I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.
No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.
Especially that big kid up in the front. (Mr. Pitt is shown on the television, trying to hold up the deflating Woody balloon.) How old is he? (The phone rings.) Hello?
You're really going to town with that turkey there.
That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?
Technically, you're sauted. So, what are you doing for that?
(Opens the door) C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? (Starts jiggling his keys - as if he's calling out for a dog) Huh? C'mon! C'mon!
Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar!
Have you said anything to her about it?
(Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?
You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.
Well, would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.)
Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.
I know, and then you say to yourself, From this moment on, Im not gonna waste any more of it. But then you go, How? What can I do thats not wasting it?
Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?
Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch?
Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?
"I don't know but I was spitting out and rinsing like there was no tomorrow."
(writing) Here's my address and number. And really, thanks again.
He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.
Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?
My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on. (Kramer enters with a bucket and starts filling it with water on the sink) Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.
Didn't you see the sign on the door?
I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation.
Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.
Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people.
Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.
Actually, yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!
Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the lunch with me?
Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it.
What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?
What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.
Oh my god, you're kidding. (dives for his wallet) Hang on a second. (reading from his registration) It's JVN 728.
I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes when someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within the gay community. They're probably discriminated against because of that, people say to them "Y'know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but I think think it's about time, y'know that you got in shape, tucked the shirt in and lost the wife". But if people are even going to assume that people that are neat are gay, maybe instead of doin' this, "Y'know I think Joe might be a little... [waves hand back and forth]", they should vacuum "Y'know I think Joe might be >vroom< [makes vacuuming motion]. Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little >vrooom<..."
Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!
If only the coin hadnt hit the table.
(interrupts) What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today. (on the phone) Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we would do that. Okay. Great! Thanks a million! Okay, bye.
Well what am I going to tell Alex?
so the woman was walking around in a bra
Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.
(putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to Sopie's) Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship.
Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.
... I think. Have some more wine. (Jerry pours his whole glass of wine into her glass.)
Hey you know George isn't to happy, ahh, about your new friendship.
H... G... F. Seat four. One, two, three... f-- Hello Newman.
What, he doesn't like my taste in music?
Gee, I just didnt expect it from the way youve been acting.
I mean I'm happy sometimes, but-but not now.
I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers.
Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?
I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? "You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know "No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back."
Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?
(sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.
That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!
I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.
Fifty years they were married. Now hes moving to Pheonix.
Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.
"I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery."
Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!
I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory.
So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?
Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer!
(A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.
I didn,t tell you to park in that lot .. Now someone's gonna have to drive you every time you need your car.? Take the bus!
You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?
Whats the difference?! Thats the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!
So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?
I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?
Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.
You know, Kramer's gonna clean up on this place.
Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?
No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.
(While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands him a nickel)
Oh, I cant believe it. Let me see that. (Jerry takes the paper.) Thats four and a half points in three days! Thats almost half my money!
No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?
He asked you to watch them not wear them.
I thought we were going to the movies?
(Shouting) Come on up! (Opens his door for Elaine)
What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?
Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners.
I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals.
(bored) Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it.
Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!
So what your genitals are still lined up.
So what are calling me six times a day?
I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...
why don't you just break it off with her. tell her it's over
Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?
Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, You think?
Good. And Ill tell you what... You dont have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.
So are you gonna get him a chair?
Good shake. Perfect shake. Single pump, not too hard, you know, doesn't have to prove anything, but, you know, firm enough to know he was there.
What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these, like Superman? I've got to unlock this mystery.
Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?
Whats with the pink lining and the candy stripes?
Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--
I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened.
Well there's always a place for you, on our team.
Its not promised to anybody? Cause shed take it in a second.
Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.
So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, "Jerry"? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They're putting it on the air! They're giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California!
Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.
I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..
What are you all out of breath from?
Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - theyre doing sign language now.
Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.
If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.
My honest opinion, I think she made it up.
I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.
No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?
All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! Just wait here and I'll get it for you. ... Kramer this is Tia.
The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper!
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.
Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.
Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.
Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.
By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.
(on the phone) Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.
Well what about me! If you're going like that, I?m not going like this.
I gotta talk to her. What do you think?
(nonplused) You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?
Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?
I'd be very interested in something like that.
Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.
I gotta say, thats pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.
You're passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago!
(looking of into the distance) I guess that's true...
Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.
So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...
Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.
You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?
No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him.
Dont worry. (whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!... Its Jerry!... Jerry!... From next door!... Never mind where I am!... Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!...
What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of temperament?
Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. If you're there it'll be a better group.
She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing.
It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?
(looks round) Don't worry, I'll get you out.
I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. (Lena is puzzled.)
Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it.
Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!
No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.
Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money.
It's okayit's just a hot dog, (still sobbing) everything is going to be okay.
Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?
Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?
Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?
(Gestures to his forehead) Youre getting that vein again.
That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.
I got you an apartment in the building.
Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.
(to George) So did you bring the lease? (George takes the lease from his inside pocket and hands it to Jerry.) All right, gee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time.
Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they want
Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?
This is a person I like, its not How to score on spring break.
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.
(cont) and this whole justice league, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman. You mean to tell me Superman can't cover everything?
So you want to go to the party on Friday night?
I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?
Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! (Kramer gestures sympathetically) And who buries a bird?
(His thoughts) I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver.
He might want a show about anything and everything.
Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent. It's very boring.
(seeing Elaine enter Monk's) Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body?
(wistful) I don't know, I just see you guys together.
The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. Cause it says Waiting Room. Theres no chance of not waiting. Cause they call it the waiting room, theyre gonna use it. Theyve got it. Its all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and youve got your little magazine. You pretend youre reading it, but youre really looking at the other people. You know, youre thinking about about them. Things like, I wonder what hes got. As soon as she goes, Im getting her magazine. And then, they finally call you and its a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. Well, I guess Ive been chosen. Ill see you all later. You know, so you think youre going to see the doctor, but youre not, are you? No. Youre going into the next waiting room  the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You dont wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You dont want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in? Do they scalp tickets to these things? I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two...
I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.
Religion, my friend, thats what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that its going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.
So he's been lying to me for two months?!
Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place.
Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.
Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, "Why knock my brains out?"
Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there.
(throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?
I cant believe it! This guy ripped me off!
Yeah. You know, kind of a peace offering. Cute.
All right take it easy, just take it easy.
Let's check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil.
Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.
(walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!
(What's goin' on,) like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--
Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters)
Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.
Where did I take it? Where Did I Take It? (stabbing a knife into a cutting board) Umm, to that place on, uh Columbus and 85th. Okay?
Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 1130.
Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.
Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?
How late are the stores open? Im thinking of maybe uh, buying a new TV and smash it over my head.
(reluctant) Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too.
Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.
Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.
I think I offended the wake-up guy...! (worried)
I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.
you know I'd like to hear about this job of yours
Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?
Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other line. Just a second.
Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.
Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless.
Whenever I see the news and they're hauling in some kind of terrorist, psycho, maniac, mass murderer guy. You notice he's always covering up his face with the newspaper, with the jacket, with the hat. What is he worried about? I mean what is this man's reputation? That he has to worry about this kind of exposure damaging his good name? I mean, what is he up for a big job promotion down at the office or something? Afraid the boss is gonna catch this on TV and go "isn't that Johnson from sales? He's up in that clock tower picking people off one by one. I don't know if that's that kind of man we want heading up that new branch office. He should be in bill collection. I think he's got aptitude."
Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.
Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.
Hey look ,you know, you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here. You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me.
Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...
So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?
"Wait a second ..Where you wearing those shoes in the cab?"
If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.
Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes outside)
Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.
I could tell you what I did, but you wouldnt believe it. Its not believable.
George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'
(tearing through his laundry bag) Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on, let's go.
Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.
(referring to George's outfit) And what mood is this.
Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.
Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?
Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?
Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down. (To Elaine) What?
Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner
You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?
All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.
Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?
Hello? Oh, hi honey. (annoyed, weary) Yes, I told him. I'll get it. (George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry to argue with Meryl on the phone.) Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...
(pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?
No, let's just do it. (Fire alarm goes off) What? What is going on? What is that about?
I still don't know what the idea is.
Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?
I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.
I don't know how I feel about it.
I said, "How come no one's killed her?" Probably shouldn't have said anything,
Leo's furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at George's book) What is that doing on the table?
Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!
He went to get some steak sauce. Why?
Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, that's it. They go to the next show.
Wow. Kenny Rogers Roasters. Finally open. Hey, look at the size of that neon chicken on the roof.
Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.
Hmm. So you feel "women and children first," in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.
I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.
Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.
(Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my domain. But I will tell you this I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!
Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...
Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)
Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?
He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, that were manufactured in Korea.
Now, there's a career path you may have overlooked.
(as Ping rambles on ) ...S'cuse me (Ping looks up) Kind of an expensive call.
(Sarcastic) Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.
So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?
(taking out his wallet and handing over bills grudgingly) Fifty dollars.
Well, what's going on? What is this thing?
(disappointed) Answering machine. (jovially) Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.
Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
Look at you, youre still thinking about it. Ill never feel comfortable.
So, its okay? I could just tell her she can have it?
Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?
He is merry, I'll give him that. (notices a cactus on the table) What's this plant for?
Ah, don't worry. I made reser... (catches himself)
You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!
You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial.
Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here.
(To George) Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?
Yeah, well that relationships really got a lot of potential.
Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log.
Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.
(TO GEORGE) Hey George, you ever see one?
He left me there. You see the mind games?
Im sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!
Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.
There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing.
Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didnt want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And its been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. (to Kramer) All right, so, just take what you want and lets get it out of here.
Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.
(flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb.
Got it. (but now a man-hand grabs his arm) Uh!
(As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George.
Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.
(under his breath) Well, this worked out just as I had hoped.
(doubtful) Yeah, you'll make it up to me.
I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.
I've hardly been out to dinner with them.
I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.
Yeah, I cant eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I cant dance.
(eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.
Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?
Here you go. (Poppie stands up and takes the money.) Anyway, I'm sorry again about the...(notices a large, wet stain on his couch)...the...the...
No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch)
No he's going downtown to guard the suit.
Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!
I-I-I don't like the opera. What are they singing for? Who sings? You got something to say, say it!
Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything. Why don't we all just go to Paris?
No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy.
(To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.
What happened to you? You were going like a hundred miles an hour.
I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.
Alright.. (Heads for the door, grabbing his coat)
Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time.
Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?
That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is.
Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about it!
Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?
But I don't know if this is gonna work.
But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?
Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.
Why don't you put it in the *bank*?
All right, all right. All right, thats enough! Lets get back to my deal. That undercoating, thats a rip-off, isnt it, David?
Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.
Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that "Miss Congeniality" on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going? (Kramer enters.) Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey, what are you doing tonight?
Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
Well, once I didnt have dinner until, like 900 oclock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage  meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya? Throw out my garbage for me.
So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.
But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.
Hello. Didn't I see you at the pro shop yesterday?
It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck!
Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...
Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.
Hey, lll just keep swimming. Hey, hey. Im not done. I know what you're up to Ramon. Because Im a member here, this is my place to swim.
I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
He used to go there a lot on business.
But you said, it can be very serious.
C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!
I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.
This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!
Could you excuse me one second? Im sorry.
You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.
All right lets go. We'll meet you back down here in ten minutes, hopefully with the money.
What happened to your head when you got hit?
What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him? 'Cos I asked him about the Knicks?
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.
(thinking) Well, the drive home should be a delight. Im speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I dont care. (to Vanessa) That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room?
Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.
Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?
Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) Thats it. Done!
Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)
It's not one of those 976 calls, is it?
(To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.
So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?
Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!
I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that couldn't be.
I thought youre like Hitler in the bunker?
Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley.
Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?
You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!
"I dunno how you could forget . He kept reffering to himself in the third person. "Jimmy's under the boards. Jimmy's in the open. Jimmy makes the shot."
Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.
It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.
(continuing) The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.
Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.
Jenna's like me. She's very... (searches for word)
"So what about the Penthouse. Did you ask him?"
If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?
(Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.
Course you know there is always the possibility, that she called an audible.
"Yeah!!! What is that? I mean isn't that sick. I mean , I'd be embarrassed to have that in my apartment."
(picking up the phone and dialing) It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.
This is the man you have a crush on?
You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me.
Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.
(pause, to Donna) You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name...
You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.
George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.
Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone to ghost read it.
I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.
Wait a second. (Grabs the icebucket off the counter.) This'll scare 'em off. (Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. Jerry gets back into bed.) Well, good night, Ollie.
And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.
I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.
Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?
Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.
I don't know what to tell you, Elton.
Seth, it's me. What's more important than catching up with an old college buddy?
No. This is why you're not in the pilot.
George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!
(places two slices of bread against Kramer's face) That is close.
So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.
Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune.
Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.
George, I didnt sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. Im just going to be honest. Thats all... Yes, Im nervous... Are you listening to me?... Just put some soap on your finger. Itll slide right off... Then try axle grease... (Kramer enters; to the phone) Ill call you back after I talk to her... Bye.
Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses... I need an awkward pause.
No I wasn't there. (enters and slams the door)
So she kicked him out of the apartment.
Yeah well King Edward didnt live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.
You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."
I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.
Well, Ill tell you what. Ill choose you for it. Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...thats it, you gotta win three.
Do you want to go with him? You go. I dont mind.
(from the back of the club, leaving) That's it I'm calling in the big guns.
No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up?
Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. (And to George) What do you mean you can't tell me?
You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!
So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.
(to George) He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.
If I see her, what do I say that Im doing here in the building?
What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.
Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.
Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah.
I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, "Oh This is so good. What's in it?" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not.
September 21st, first day of Autumn. Leaves changing colours.. Beautiful colors.
You know, I think he wears a piece.
You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?
Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude.
Why, you don't think it's a good job?
....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant? Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it in there by helicopter, you know keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. "We got the hair but I think we lost the Zest." ....rejects the transplant with organs. Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . Guy just standin' there and suddenly... ..Bink! ( motions hair flying out of his head)........lands in someone's frozen yogurt.
Oh that's George. (presses the intercom button) Yeah?
Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.
Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.
I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?
Yeah. (pointing at Elaine as he goes into the bedroom)
Whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guyll be like, I dont think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life? And of course the womans looking at the guy, thinking, What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?
Could you move your car back a little?
So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up The good, the bad, or the ugly.
Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at no more than three miles an hour.
I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You know (does the motion for the check) Check, Check. Unless the waiter isn't too shape then you gotta total it up. Sometimes they come over, "Do you want the check?" No I wanna be pen pals, can't you see what I'm doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people.
I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say.
Well, you know; not everything. I do what I can.
You told Testikov, (Elaine nods) that Tolstoy wanted to name his book "War-- What Is IT Good For?"?
Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets.
Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that.
That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up. (phone rings) Excuse me one second.
Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?
Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.
You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...
Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really.
(turning on the commercial) Right, quiet dignity. As opposed to, say, this?
The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.
Oh, shes really great. I mean, shes got like a real warmth about her and shes really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better.
Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?
(pointing out the obvious) George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him.
Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours.
Franco's no good? ...They got no team leaders.
(to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!
They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.
I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.
No, It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago . she's trying to become an actress.
He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. He's a time slot hit.
It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.
I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it.
Wouldnt it be great if you could ask a woman what shes thinking?
No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.
Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.
So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?
So you just did the opposite of everything?
Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.
His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I wouldve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. Hes so self-involved.
(standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. (indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.
You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.
Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.
What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display. (takes the peanut butter jar away from George)
Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.
We'll see about that. (Runs to the window and shouts up to Kramer, who's on the roof.) Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win!
You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it?
That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.
Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.
I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes.
But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.
Great, I had fun. Wheres the TV, wheres the VCR?
I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldnt do that.
The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.
Because she's my wife! (The door buzzer sounds; Jerry answers it) Yeh?
Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?
You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go... up.
Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something.
No I can't she didn't leave her name or number.
No, I tried it on. It fits good.
(to George) I mean, come on. (a thought occurs) No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from *Seals and Croft*.
People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.
Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)
Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad.
(to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?
Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!
Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.
I dont know. Theyve been in there since, like, World War II. The rents three hundred a month.
Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!
No, but he's not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR)
No ,no I don't, I mean, Don't be silly..
oh uh nothing, she just.. choked on a jujube
So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?
Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on.
He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?
Elaine, you cannot judge a person on a situation like that. I mean it's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert
Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime.
What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.
Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!
Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- Ill be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too.
(Stops pulling on the pants) Alright, alright, That's no good. (Moves Kramer over to the couch) Let me try getting them from the bottom. (Goes for Kramer's Leg) Just gimme one leg.
I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
(leaving) You two keep an eye on each other?
Why should I have anything for say for myself?
And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.
No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--
(finding Frankie, in his hole) Frankie... come on out of there.
George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.
I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.
Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.
(Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.
So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?
How 'bout if it was something like " I can't find my receipt my place's a stye.
Yeah, let me just stop by the cash machine and I'll meet you over at the coffee shop.
Well you can't take her maybe you can't take me either.
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. (Picks up the phone and dials.)
(Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.
Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document.
Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.
Pam? What do you care? (Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying a Brentano's bookstore bag.)
No, Uncomfortable? Not at all. (ASIDE TO ELAINE) My friend's wife's breast sticking out - why would that make me uncomfortable?
Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.
Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.
Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.) You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?
So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?
Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman...
Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.
So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?
Hey, it's one thing if I asked you "Could you do me a favor?" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE (Obviously up to something. Jerry doesn't suspect anything - yet) Whey you told me what you went through on the plane, it makes you stop and think. You appreciate having a real friend.
Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.
We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.
I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife fight for a citrus drink.
First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did.
The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting out that marriage.
I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation. The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?"
So you want to just abolish all home package deliveries.
Kind of in the middle of something here, George.
All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.
I cant. Im on my way out. Theres no way I can do it.
He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV.
She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.
(To Nina) Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy, huh?
I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.
Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?
So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George?
No, I just wanted to see what time it was.
I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them are doing her dance as they go)
I mean, if were gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.
Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?
Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal right now. (covers Jean-Paul with a blanket)
(hands up) I don't want it that way.
Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man.
A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?
How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!
Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket.
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!
Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!
Well it's been quite a night I could sure use a cup of coffee.
Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity. 5? 3? Oh, it was just an expression. All right, well, that's very sweet of you. Okay, I'll call you later. All right, bye. Hey!
She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence
Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?
(tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggage, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangements, but we can't seem to be friends when we sleep together.
Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.
Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. (holds his nose up like a pig) You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.
Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. Its completely shrunk. Theres absolutely no way I can wear it.
I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I cant imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but thats me. Alright
(Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal.
Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.
I just thought ahh maybe I could talk to Roy, if um
Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)
Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drakes coffee cake
I got a date with that girl, Lena.
Thanks, because I would really like... (distractedly puts coffee cup back on the table)
(privately amused) Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while. (indicating Elaine) Her too.
alright I changed my mind, uh yeah I don't think I'm not gonna go now
Don't look at him. (Phil starts to knock on the door)
Um, I haven't got my watch on. It's being fixed.
Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?
Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.
The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.
Well, look at this guy. Look, hes got everything, hes got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners.  This is not his first load.
Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.
Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.
Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?
Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.
That puddle! (Kramer sees the puddle and does a double-take.)
Oh. No. What, you mean because of the "Chang"?
I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.
I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.
Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?
I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous!
(to Ramon) Oh. Okay. (to Elaine) Wh, what is he doing here?
What do you say to a person like you?
You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you... (catches himself)
I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?
What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?
Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
Oh my god. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops!
I don't need a reason to give gifts, it's my nature. I love to make people happy.
Im always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice. Never quite sure, Is this the best lane for me? For my life? Theyre always a little bit ahead of you, Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there? Yeah, come on over here, pal. Were zoomin over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it. The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen? Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday well be going, (Jerry pretends hes driving in reverse.) Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. Im gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.
Kramer, do you realize what's going on here? Do you know why you're here?
Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.
Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show.
How do you like that? (tries to turn away again; thinking)Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I cant, I cant. Im stuck.
Yeah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.
Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
Alright Kramer, enough of this. Let's go find George.
Why don't you just get rid of it?
No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture.
Im Dan. Can I have my list back, please?
Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?
Excuse me, uh...dentist? You a dentist? (The guy shakes his head. Jerry moves on to another guy.) Dentist? Are you a dentist?
Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.
That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.
This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-
....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together.
I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.
(bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.
All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. She's at CALVIN KLEIN's right now.
Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test?
So you have no control over the remote?
Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.
Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly) and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it.
I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.
Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again?
So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?
(Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.
What is it she think you can't do?
I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.
Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.
I got it! (snaps his fingers) We give the keys to Elaine.
And youre sure the floss was the catalyst?
It's over there. I know where it is.
You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.
Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other?
Well, well, look at you. It?s a little skimpy there isn't it?
He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.
Kramer's Andre, he's fooling around with these 976 numbers (Kramer walks out of the bedroom) hey I told you, I don't want you doing that on my phone
Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.
You'll be out before we get the check.
Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it!
So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?
And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?
Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up)
All right, but you have to go now.
Well, well, why are you getting rid of your refrigerator? (he gets up from the table and carries a dish into the kitchen)
Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?
I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care
She went out to get her head shaved.
You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.
(weary) Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out?
It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
I don't know Kramer, ahh, my concern is that ....
Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?
Oh yeah, Sfuzi? I- I've gotta do that.
Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.
Listen to this "I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."
(as Kramer walks by) You're a master of race relations.
So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?
wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to just sense it's in front of the couch?
Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.
Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts, so he killed him.
. . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?
How could I know she would start to laugh?
Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.
You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.
That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.
Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. Youve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?
So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!" So he says to me, "What are ya gonna do about it?"
Yeah, well I don't trust this guy. I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.
(ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.
Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, "Hey, they like the soup! Keep it up!"?
It's been three days already, forget about Lupe.
How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean, it's only this wide!
Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, Yeah, I got this new thing Platonic. My idea, my name, callin it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- dont do anything, and go right home. Whatd you think? I think its going to be big! I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didnt work. Yknow, I bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, Uh, Hi, uh my names Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, its a Riconic relationship.
(Reading it) "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." - What is that?
Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.
Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.
Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him.
We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.
'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?
So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?
What's going on here. How is that possible?
Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?
(While looking at posters of women wearing glasses) I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.
I've been waiting a while for this. You know it's a shame Tony got all banged up, we're not gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
(agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!
I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've been so helpful.
No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.
Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.
Ill have the, ah, turkey club without the bacon.
(watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans?
So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?
I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.
All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the bottle of fungicide.)
Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.
Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.
How long are you suppose to leave it on for?
No, don't stop, Kramer. Keep going, don't let him get away.
So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?
I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, its very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, Call the police. You really should call the police. So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, Yeah, Im calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... Im gonna see some real action. Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out The Report. They give you Your Copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I dont really think were gonna crack this case, do you? Its not like Batman, where theres three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up, hes dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him, hes a PENGUIN!
Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?
He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.
There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair, striped shirt?
I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. (Slams the door on Newman's face. Then tries to delay talking to Newman by keeping the conversation with George going) So, you want a protein shake, or something?
Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift. I know, it's a label maker. The Label Baby Junior. Yeah, I hear they're good. Well, label me thankful. Okay, well you enjoy those tickets. Buh-bye.
You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?
How come? I told you - It's fantastic.
Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese. (buys a newspaper out of a machine)
Why can't I buy my father a car?
Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's got this strangest habit. She eats her peas one at a time. You've never seen anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. I mean, we've had dinner other times. I've seen her eat Corn Niblets. But she scooped them.
What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
(Joking about the bra-less wonder) Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.
Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.
Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?
(like a frustrated child) Why can't I know?
Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.
(Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?
So George, how do I beat this lie detector?
Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.
I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example.
See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. (Elaine laughs.) All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free.
(spits the nut) OooH!!! You. you ate these? You sucked on these and put them on the plate?
Well... theres a little bit of a problem.
She thinks youre a guy that doesnt like coffee.
(aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?
And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.
Well this is a great place to sit you got here.
Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.
(handing his dad a gift) Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.
Well you might as well look it over.
You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?
You know, I think I'll just take the check.
(Trying to block out Kramer, he starts to sing along with the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus..
Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!
Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby.
Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?
(Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine?
It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. "It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad." But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, "I refuse to put any thought into this at all." Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?
How much did you wound up tipping her?
Lean your head back. Open your mouth! (Grabs Kramer's head) Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!
Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.
And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month!
Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income.
Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a...
I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special treatment.
Oh, about the... uh (Jerry pretend to wash his hands)
okay , bye (to George) What happened , did you take it off?
Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?
(To Elaine) It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's unconscious.
You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.
Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?
Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?
In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?
Yes it is. I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior.
Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?
Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am  rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give...
You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.
You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?
Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.
That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact.
Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--
No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.
Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here...
An old friend of mine, whom you may have met, George Costanza, has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formally a highly placed official with an outfit known as the IRS. And as we speak, at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information. And she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise.
Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again.
Hey, what happened to your coat? And what is the smell? Is-ya, What are you drunk?
Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?
(leaving; singing) She'll be coming around the mountain...
He can't just throw me off the plane!
You know, I really need to use the bathroom.
And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?
Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you?
(grimaces and takes the shovel back) I'll dig.
Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.
Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!
Revenge date? That sound like you more than me.
I was out in the snow last night.
Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?
You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?
You don't think she's just talking to me?
(to the phone) Oh, its you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldnt have had to do this. Now thats two long distance calls I made to you why cant you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again; to nobody) Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much.
It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something.
Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?
No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.
Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.
(moving over to block the door) Where are you going?
You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?
Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.
Why didn't you just ask her for it?
I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?
Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar.
That was brutal. I cant go back out there.
Hold it. Broccoli? Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce.
Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.
(C0NT'D) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.
All right, so youre chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead.
It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.
Hello Elaine? Patty Lawrence had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?
Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.
I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.
Cheque. Now, the fact is, if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, yknow, cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they dont know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster (Jerry draws imaginary book from a holster.) Who do I make it out to? Theres my ID. Theres something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I dont know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, I dont have any money, but if youll contact these people, Im sure theyll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I dont have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?
I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright*, I forgive you...
(removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?
(Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to look, but Jerry stops her) I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs.
(nudging George) Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.
You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry?
Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets.
Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?
That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.
(Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.
..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye. HA Ha..Who do these women think they're dealing with? Did she think she was gonna leave this incredibly erotic message on my tape and I was just gonna let it go. Not Bloody likely...
No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.
Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.
(Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing?
Youre wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!
I'm not sure, but I think she was nice. (takes a sip of water)
And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.
So you were talking, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") you're having pleasant conversation, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") then all of sudden...
Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.
Hey Kenny. (with some fake enthusiasm, just to be polite)
Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.
You know, the water pressures terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower.
Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.
Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?
Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.
(Noting) You know, I've never seen you drive.
Well how did he react when you gave it to him?
Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.
Ive got the softball game on Wednesday. Its the championship.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!
Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.
And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya?
Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.
(stares at George, incredulous) "Back on"? What was it doing off?
What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with. [To attendant] What is going on?
Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.
(jumps in surprise) Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be gone.
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why dont you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin anything?
...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry.
Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess youre not going in anymore.
Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?
It has nothing to do with whose house it is.
So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.
Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to Elaine)
I don't know, but you better keep it up.
O.k., good, I'll see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.)
All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, "It's been real," move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.
I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.
Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!
Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.
I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.
(annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? Besides it's not a submarine and there's no room for a periscope in a car.
So, you wanna come up for a few minutes?
Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!
How can I want it now, if you want it?
I love the day date. No wine, No shower.
He could have said "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.
I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.
What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one.
Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me?
Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.
He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes.
Well, for one think, don't listen to him.
(Shrugs) Oops. (Continues walking along the route, whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street, then keeps walking)
Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment.
Okay, okay. Forget it. Its okay. I didnt mean it.
George! Can we focus on the car, here?
I think we might have one left in the stock room.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want.
You didn't like that crack about the pen.
So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!
I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.
Oh, like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping carts with one bad wheel?
So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.
Oh who made you a Mohel? Whadya, get your degree from a matchbook?
(Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.
Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.
(Joking around) Hey, didn't I beat you up in the fourth grade?
Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? That's like half a pound of turkey!
It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse "ha's." You know those?
(Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.
I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!
Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.
So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots.
Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, "Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. " "What are you watching?" "I don't care, I gotta keep going." "Who was that?" "I don't know what it was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going." Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, "Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel." You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, "Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of here. I'm going to bed."
Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere... I got my bags, I'm ready to go.
And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
(examining the label) Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.
Im going out. (he comes out of the dressing room, while Kramer remains inside)
Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up...
(seeing Fredo's tombstone) Oh, my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up! (hands the shovel to Kramer)
Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?
You are. I can't get that thing in my car. (referring to George)
I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.
(cynical) This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday?
There's girls everywhere. I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator. They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?
All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.
I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.
You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.
(Kramer shows Jerry and Elaine the paper) "Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research".." Government funds genetic research at area hospital" ... Yeah, so?
Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?
Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.
It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?
Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again? (listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone. C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me. (hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello.
(into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!
So you were with him that day at the track?
Alright, come on, lets get out of here.
(Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.
(leaving the room) I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much.
I love these nature shows, Ill watch and kind of nature show, and its amazing how you can always relate, to whatever theyre talking about. You know like youre watching the African Dung Beetle and youre going Boy, his life is a lot like mine. And you always root for whichever animal is the star of the show that week -- like if its the antelope, and theres a lion chasing the antelope you go, Run antelope Run! Use your Speed, Get away! But the next week its the lion, and then you go Get the antelope, eat him, bite his head! -- Trap him, dont let him use his speed!
Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!
Which part? The renovating the restaurant you dont own part or spending the two hundred million you dont have part?
Oh! my god. What the hell is this? ..... Don't tell me.......Velvet!!!
It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook?
(admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.
(tapping the spatula while waiting for waffles to be done) Any second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready.
...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the patient!
Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestl's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--
and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye.
We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.
Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?
Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel.
Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?
All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff.
(cutting in) I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman.
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang"...
Alright, I'm gonna get this. This looks good.
There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.
I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.
Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.
Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me.
Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe well get together.
At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.
Well you know what this means, don't you?
Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up?
Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.
Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for?
(Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell smoke?
Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.
Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.
That is a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. Some guy from NBC saw my set, he wants me to do a showcase. I might have another shot at a pilot.
Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?
Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.
Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer, sitting on his lawn chair with a sparkler)
So lemme ask you this how long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night.
Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world He's Boring.
(nodding awkwardly for a moment) All right, I think we're done here. (Jerry leaves and Phil shuts the door darkly)
No, hes It. He wins. It is good.
Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. (pretends to pull hair out)
Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both killed!
Oh, its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.
Well, it couldnt be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?
Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)
You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.
Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made.
Dont worry about it, it wasnt working anyway.
Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?
I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!
she's one of these people, always have to be different
Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour, then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night.
You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? When I'm on stage that's all I hear; You stink, You suck. We like magic.
Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.
By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.
I guess they leave that up to the general population.
Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know its missing, and he took it! And of all things to take! I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. Hes crazy.
Aw.. right, code of silence.. how's that going?....Ha!!...
Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.
Elaine got a new number because she died.
So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye.
Well I started screaming, "There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina." Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running (In the background -- CLERKS VOICE 57) and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!
(looking at Kramer's moustache) Uh, we're not doing that anymore.
All right. (picks up the alarm clock) Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 650... volume check. (music playing, he starts swinging) What kinda music you wanna wake up to? Top 40, classical...
Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?
Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.
Doesnt think anyone can tell. So cmon, do we have a deal?
Good, going good (scratches chin) And the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty good - not bad - I gotta get out. (scratches chin, nose then covers eyes with hands)
Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.
No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.
Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.
Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? Im sorry. I didnt mean it. I took it out on you. Were still friends. Were still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, Ill tell you what. Ive got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.
Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.
(Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.
Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, "Oh. Tube socks." What are you gonna do about it?
He was running from a bee. (Elaine laughs)
I don't know, opera, it?s not my kind of thing.
Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying "mickey"!
No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.
Hello? Yeah he's here. (to Kramer) Hey! It's for you.
Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered? (Sees the pac) What happened?
(answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.
I dont think so. You know they, theyre so fragile.
You like the couch? Ill tell you what Im gonna do.
Schumann. (George stops himself, frightened. Jerry looks around the lobby.) Where are they?
What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)
Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.
Well I don't want to take too much off.
(Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?
It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.
A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see 'em. Come on, I'm calling! (thumps hand on table) What d'you got!
I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy.
All right, just give me a western. (unhappy)
Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.
Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?
They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.
May I see you outside for a moment please?
No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o.
I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.
Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.
I cant believe Im gonna do this. (Jerry opens the door and exits the dressing room. He walks over to Bania)
Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up(?). Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.
(agreeing) well three years is a long time to be married.
(Picks one up) Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?
Well, how much are you going to invest?
I dont know, I don't feel so good.
Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something.
Im takin it, Im takin the place. Im gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. Im livin here...Im movin.
I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.
Uh, this is George. (reaches for her name) Im sorry...
What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp, why do you want shade?
I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.
Listen, uh I just remembered... Im... uh, getting a facial.
Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door.
He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them
You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.
He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.
I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
Latex? And what do I do with latex?
Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, (looking at the TV) Kramer, turn that up.
No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out.
Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game.
You see , I kept up my end of the pact.
George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say,kookie talk.
Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed...
I have no patience for lactose. And I wont stand for it. Um, Ill be right back.
And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.
That was a one in a million Mohel.
He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication.
So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.
Oh, no. Its not that I dont think you can. I know that you cant, and Im positive that you wont.
I thought you were going out with Celia?
Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...
I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.
The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..
He asked me to. We were getting along.
Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.
If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened.
That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother.
You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about the Costanzas'
Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll never get another date with her. She'll freak out.
I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for him for a second.
No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.
No. We both just saw the same monkey.
You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.
Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.
There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.
No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West? Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.
Really? How come you never pursued her before?
You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.
Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! (Kramer exits.)
(Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?
Ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.
Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.
Well, that's it! Tonight's the night. I'm getting one. No "if and's or but's".
Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats right behind the glass?
Why didn't you come up with your own?
Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?
I want this baby fully loaded. (listens) Well, how soon can you get it there? (listens) Oh, that's terrific. (listens) Okay, thanks, bye.
I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!
(motions of making out) Well you were involved in some sort of amorous...
(impatient) Gone! (starts maniacally laughing) (briefly stops to point and explain) That bumper sticker.
hey you know it's weird because that voice sounded a little familiar to me
Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than "coffee machine show."
What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?
I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.
Ill call him. (Jerry picks up the cordless phone. He points to the rotary phone on the coffee table. Kramer, George, and Elaine struggle for it.) Hello, Ray?... Hi, Ray, this is Ravas friend, Elaines friend, Jerry... The King of Comedy, right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? (He covers the reciever and yells at Kramer and George.) Would you shut up?! (to the phone) Yeah, you dont want to talk about it over the phone?.. You dont want Rava to hear?... Yeah, I understand... You know that coffee shop near my house, Monks?... All right, tomorrow... One o clock... Great, okay, bye.
Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours. (And with that, Jerry made the most fatal mistake of his life)
No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?
That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.
Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there.
Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you?
(beginning to cough and struggle) Getting weak... Losing power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing without me. Nothing!
(fidgets like he has no room with George next to him)... Could you move over there?!
What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him, I dont think were right for each other. Hes a guy! At least with a woman, theres a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.
Yeah, and youre just what shes looking for too  a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.
-programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'
I dont wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do you think?
There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.
Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!
There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that...
I asked. Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian football.
I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.
Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.
Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips.
No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.
It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!
(uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.
Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?
I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?
There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?
Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday.
Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?
Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives. (Picks up phone and dials) Hello Tim? Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you? Well it turns out I can use them. Oh, you do? I understand. Okay. Bye. He already made plans, he can't change them.
We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these women.
Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.
No, "yada yada" is good. She's very succinct.
Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go.
I just wanted to say how sorry I was...
You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...
Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.
Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
(pointing at Georges shirt) See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. Its too high! Its in no-mans-land. You look like you live with your mother.
...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to.
Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide.
All right, all right. (trying on the suit jacket)
I dont know. Its got a pink lining.
Hey buddy. I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's like in there, all night long things are creaking and cracking. And that red light is burning my brain!
So have your parents found out about it?
I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work.
The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.
I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a riot.
What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, that?s not fair, what about George, Susan and Elaine, what do you need me for?
(he hits a few keys and looks over at her) Cash advance... yes (hits a key)  no (he looks over again) balance inquiry... no (he looks again) receipt.... no (he looks again) processing... processing... (He opens the box, pulls out his money and then looks at the woman and says) I won!
Well, good night [holds hand out and shakes hand]
So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you this thing was good!
I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how theyre going to look at a thing like this.
With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.
There's no watch ... I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep good time. My parents gave it to me, but I didn't like it. So don't mention it again, okay!
Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers?
Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day.
All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.
No body said youre fat. Hes a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy.
Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George.
Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office
Okay... but theres no cake or anything, if thats what youre looking for.
Oh, I see. So you can go, "Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!"
The Improv is playing "Rochelle Rochelle" The musical.
You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?
You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?
Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?
As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protg of my own.
Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?
It's like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action.
Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?
Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.
Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.
But I could do that and the music.
Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?
Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
So forget about the books. Did you read them?
wait, where are you going? where are you going?
(grunting as he throws bread into the air)
Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg.
You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.
Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)
Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.
"What are you doing that for, you got a job"
Well, we gotta get it washed (pulls off a few flyers)....Ah, the keys are locked inside!
See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think?
(Losing it, mad) Look, it's not my shirt.
That's what I do with him [points at George]
In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.
What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them.
No. I think it's Demi. (the "i" sounds like an "e")
Really? Did you hear that? Somebody else was killed!
(picks it up) I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table.
No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?
I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!
Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.
Yeah. (subdued) I don't think this is the jacket.
Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!
No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?
Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.
How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?
I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand.
(out of window) George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!
Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thingreal bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though.
Hey is the same thing as hello. What do you think Jeannie.
Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment. How 'bout I make it up to you with dinner?
Actually it's being taken care of right now.
[not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]
(Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.
On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!
Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?
As a guy I dont know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I dont know how to say, Bill, I feel I need to see other men. Do you know what I mean? Theres nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think thats the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because theyre two guys. Thats almost all we need to have in common. Cause sports  sports and women  is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, So, whats in the refrigerator?
It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?
(to Kramer) Hold on a second. (to Morty) Hiya dad.
Yeah, yeah, take care of it. (Jerry throws her some toilet paper) Come on, George, what is it?
You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is! I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, someone asks me which way is Israel, I don't fly off the handle.
More cereal? that's your third bowl today, you had it for breakfast and lunch.
Okay. (closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self) Didn't come true.
All right, Elaine but this is beyond news. This is like Pearl Harbor. Or the Kennedy assassination. It's like not even news. It's total shock.
(extemporising) Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was registered under Slappy White.
Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.
Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!
Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.
(Continuing reading) "The Human Fund. Money for people."
I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.
George, I want you to promise me something. If Im ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.
Oh, I get it, this is about the button.
When's he leaving? (putting some items into the refrigerator)
How come you're eating your peas one at a time?
Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry.
I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.
This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes) Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?
No you can't. (hangs up the phone) Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?
YEAH? (speaking loudly so the visitor can hear him through the intercom)
I have an idea. (Elaine enters; to Elaine) We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three.
Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?
They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor.
What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. "I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other people. You won't be around me. But you will be around." "Take care now." Did you ever say that to somebody? "Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now." "Take care. Take care." What does this mean? "Take off!" Isn't that what you really want to say? "Take off now."
What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers.
Look at this, my ankle's all bitten up.
(with no emotion) It's okay. Everything is going to be all right.
Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've never heard anything like this in my life. Listen to this.
What do you think? It's like a poker game?
Im just gonna get my jacket, Ill meet you downstairs. Whats the matter, did you call?
Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, whats going on?
Would you excuse me a minute? Im gonna go to the bathroom. Ill be right back.
Can I make it up to you? Ill give you fifty bucks for the jug.
Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom.
See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! Then come out with the regular!
Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?
Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town.
When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.
Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.
I don't think so. Why would I do that?
oh look at that I got oil all over me. Can I have your napkin?
You spent the night at James's? Did we?
Oh yeah. He's good. You know he's John Ritter's cousin.
So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought ... What a coincidence. We're just about to eat.
Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.
It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.
Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.
I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.
First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.
Can't you at least die with a little dignity?
No, Elaines got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and hes suppose to do it.
Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys.
George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.
Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...
Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.
(apologetic) Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.
You want food, don't cha? (nodding his head up and down)
(interrupting) No no it's ok. (walking Rachel out) So we'll go see Schindler's List later right?
How would you know? You don't speak Korean.
That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?
You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.
Hey, I had nothing to do with it.
What is this? What are we doing? What in god's name are we doing?
Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.
How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go.
So, Puddy, I decided Im gonna go with another 900 convertible.
I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.
All right Newman, one more peep outta you, you're out of the whole operation!
Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh
No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.
You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.
You did not tell me not to sell.
No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex.
Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.
That's the way they do it in Vegas.
Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt.
Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight!
(examining the button) Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like a tooth.
Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on.
Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..
You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift.
Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on.
No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.
Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.
No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?
Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.
(locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.
(quietly) I told you to cut it out.
Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!
Hey. So how was"Blame it on the Rain?"
So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?
I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.
(Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..
Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?
No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. Maybe we should ask him.
(Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.
'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off the table.
Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.
Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door)
Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.
Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.
You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.
Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.
I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something.
I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.
Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.
They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world "I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable." (George is baffled)
I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.
I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.
No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him.
Yknow I think that even if youve had a relationship with someone, or lets say, especially if youve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, its very difficult. Isnt this? Its hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. Its like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, Look, a rabbit. The other goes, So? I believe this is your card. Look, why dont we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?
(singing) Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home.
So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more "grease monkey".
Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
Yeah.. When he's dead he'll be relieved... Oh by the way Viking Press sent a Fedex for you to my parents. They brought it with 'em.
Good idea. (phone's ringing, goes to it) (muttering) There's a beach towel on the rack.. (to phone) Yeah.
So what? A lot of older men have that.
Well, I dont really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.
I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I dont get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, Im not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, theyre so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, thats it! Its the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we dont know bout that, we dont know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas weve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! I dont think she likes me. The amazing thing is, that we still get women, dont we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. Thats why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like Where to meet men? Were here, we are everywhere. Were honking our horns to serve you better.
They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same.
Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?
Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday?
Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet.
(Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-
Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that?
Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that. (stepping over Elaine then George's legs to get to the large blue chair and sits down.)
(to Mickey) Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?
No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?
Not our "all the way", their "all the way." I got the stink of responsibility on me.
Elaine, see this T-shirt, six years I've had this T-shirt. It's my best one, I call him Golden Boy.
Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?
Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?
We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy.
Look, what do you want me to do?
No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.
You had how many dates with him? Three?
(to the phone) No believe me, Im always up at this hour. How are you?... Great... Sure... What time does the plane get in?... I got my friend George to take me...
Theres one thing I dont understand. Why does it please you? (to the phone) George Costanza, please.
No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman.
No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.
What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you.
I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?
So the roommate laughed at everything I said.
(continuing unphased) You wanna get the other end, cause I wanna get it in the hall.
Oh! I got a message. (presses button on answer machine)
(cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You havent been out of the building in ten years!
Right in front of me!. How do you know we're not together. Two guys, sittin' laughin' drinking Champagne Coolies.
(to himself) Hoh, that Milos. (to Patty) Well uh, what shall we do, uhm, care for a cup of coffee?
A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little decision.
(Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here?
Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist enters Monk's)
Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!
I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
Nothing. I'm sure "Jon" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! (Laughs uproariously.)
you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?
Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me.
Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.
Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.
Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal.
So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.
No, no......(long pause . they stare at the walls) Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?
Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?
Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.
(to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello.
Oh, excuse me... Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.
Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get in touch with you.
(Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So we're on for later?
Well, I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.
So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.
(Reads the pill bottle) What kind of pills are these, anyways?! "For Smuckers"? "May cause panting and loss of fur"? (Turns to Kramer) These are dog pills!
Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.
But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.
Hey, have fun at the... family reunion. (George exits) So, what do you know about this Jack fellow?
Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now.
Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.
Over here. You can see right through here.
Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?
I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?
Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something?
Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.
What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in it's path.
(about the massage)You know I think this is really helping.
Oh, Im sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.
He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.
Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.
Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.
(ranting) I can't believe how a little thing like George going too fast - and my whole weekend is gone - the plans, the packing, ... everything.
Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.
Oh right, the new job, how is it?
How do you do? (introducing himself) Uh, Jerry Seinfeld.
I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.
'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'.
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you dont have to be home on time.
What, theres something wrong with Loni Anderson? (pause) Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it.
Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to begin with! Let's face it. I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's that!
How many times you been out with him?
Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined.
Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame.
Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.
Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend. (puts his arm around Elaine's shoulder, but she shrugs it off twice)
I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
You can't. That's why they lose very few players.
No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.
Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?
(shouting) Kramer what am I going to do did you hear that that guy's gonna put a kibosh on me he's crazy he's out of his mind....
Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!
Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway.
Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.
So why don't they talk like that now?
No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey)
Why would he steal a box of raisins?
Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it!
Well, senator, Id just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it.
I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?
It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.
I live in New York. (slams the cab door) What the hell happened?
I'll tell you, that There for you crap was a stroke of genius.
Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.
Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight. In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.
Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.
I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I, guess she passed out!
No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.
Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.
We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.
(To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?
So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show, I waited for you, you never came.
So what do you have to say for yourself?
Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?
I wonder where Elaine is sitting? I really wanted you to meet her she's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend Tony
She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults. Things you would know very little about.
Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.
Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome.
How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?
Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.
Yeah have a couple of pieces, weak, weak gum yeah
Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.
Of course he did ..The guy's working ya.
See, its never as bad as you imagine.
Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me.
(To his parents) So? What do you think?
Is that like the end of the world or something?
What do you think the dry-cleaners is your own personal closet!
I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.
That was our babka. We had that babka!
I don't get this. How did this happen. I don't have a dog.
Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!
Kramer! (tries to hide he's upset and jealous)
You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now.
So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!
I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!
Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out?
What are you doing? Were going out for dinner in ten minutes.
Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents.
Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. (Elaine smiles and rolls her eyes at him) What brings you here?
I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.
Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What drives me to take chances like that?
So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City. I'm performing at Bally's.
I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I cant stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion wont even exist. It wont. I think eventually well all be wearing the same thing. Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where theres people from the future or another planet, theyre all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided, This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and boots. Thats it. We should come up for an outfit for Earth. An Earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits. No speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, That was nice. I could wear that.
Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.
Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews.
...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana...
I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.
Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place.
Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!
Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it!
What would you say if I told you that...
Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?!
There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.
I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?
Hey, I called you last night, where were you?
Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too.
No, its not that. It wasnt all one-sided.
All right, what are you gonna say to him?
..And then she starts talking about her panties.
Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally!
Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors.
I don't know. That's like asking "Where's Waldo?"
You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.
(Knocking on Kramer's door) Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey.
What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do whatever it is you do. You disgust me.
Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! (Kramer enters.)
Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.
No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.
Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?
Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?
No, look, you don't understand. I, I want the picture.
(pointedly) Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars.
Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore...
Ahh, too bad you got a little, George Costanza thing going on.
Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know, we can't go anywhere near there.
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
(Nauseated at the saying) Would you please stop saying that?!
So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)
I just hope that whole pony incident didnt put a damper on the trip.
Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.
(sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there and I will.
All right, let me ask you this when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?
Kramer!!! (Jerry points to the lamp post they are about to crash into)
Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.
Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse.
(a lightbulb goes on in his head) Riverside Drive.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.
Hey, is that my maple syrup? Oh, ya. (Kramer hands it over.)
Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred!
Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.
(holding up the '# DAD' shirt) We're even.
(scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.
You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.
(accusingly) Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.
They're ladies' glasses! You know all you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.
(exasperation) You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents.
You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. (with a British accent) "Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you".
But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.
No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.
(Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What?
So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else in real estate?
So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing?
You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy.
I dont even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, Ive met them three times in my life.
Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night.
What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back.
By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?
I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.
Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone.
(smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good.
Ya. (hits the button, opens the door. To Elaine) Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys.
There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.
You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.
Lemme see if I understand this. In other words, you held out
So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?
'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.
It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? (Kramer holds a broken Tony)
Ah, actually, I ka, kinda had some things to do.
Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?
Let me see those. ( smells them) Oh! I know the chunky that left these Chunkies......NEWMAN!!! I've got him.
So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. Whats the matter?
So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?
I don't have to be funny, I don't care.
No eight years isn't such a long streak.
I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?
No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe it. I lost him. That stupid idiot. Now what are we going to do?
No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.
I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.
Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger.
Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.
When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!
(To bartender) Can I have a club soda? (To Ronnie) Goin' on tonight?
(imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape?
Wait a second. .Just give me a second
Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.
Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.
(To George, in a 'cha-ching!' motion) Vermont! (To Ellen) With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to! (George is disturbed. He gets up, goes go Kramer's door, and knocks. They talk) Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I can't wait.. buy-bye. (Hangs up. George and Kramer come into Jerry's apartment, confronting him) What? (George takes the phone off the hook) What is this?
Yeah, killed. Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark.
It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
I don't know. What if I get caught?
You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...
"Don't you see what's happened, he couldn't talk , he's wearing these shoes, he's drooling."
Well we're sitting here together. Why wouldn't you think that.
Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this, now she's got nothing.
Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years.
What do you think it could've been just some dude?
I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?
I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?
You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.
You got a lot to learn about pancakes.
You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em.
It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.
Yes it will, now give me those keys!
No, absolutely nothing. (They get up to leave) You're fantastic! (They meet up with Kramer and George on the way out) Hey guys!
Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George "Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again."
Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.
All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go.
I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.
Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.
Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.
You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.
(to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?
This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!
And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
If I told you, you woulda given it away.
Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-
On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?
Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.)
What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what they're saying.
(thinking) I cant believe it. I got nothing! I dont even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...
But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure.
(Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.
What should I do? (to Alton) Uh, were taking a cab, arent we?
Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched voice) Gone.
Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD.
(Once again, the audience hears his thoughts) I'm so car sick. I'm gonna vomit!
No, it&Mac226;s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i...
Hey, guess what. I just bought my father a Cadillac
Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions.
I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.
Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?
Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...
So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.
No, really, I just got off the phone with him.
She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.
I once got Happy New Yeared in March.
No Elaine he's normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York.
Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine.
Yeah, big missing goin' on (spreads arms wide)
Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!
(smugly, under-his-breath) Not only that, I broke his thumbs.
I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?
Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.)
Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.
So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
Yeah!.. Thanks.Oh! my god you saved my life.
I cant think about it now. Come on, Im going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.
(To Assistant) I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?
--but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is inadvertently sent an insurance--
Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.
You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.)
Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.
Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.
Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?
And she wants to break up with you..
Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.
Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series.
So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER
Why dont you ask that doctor what it is?
(Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.
I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.
Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.
Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?
I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)
Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?
My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you dont make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life.
He really did an amazing job. Look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid! (Jerry opens refrigerator.) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups! Come here, look at this. (He gets on his knees and points.) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there?! He must be like Rubber Man!
Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.
George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman!
Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them.
Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.
Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, George Louis Costanza. Here I am about to go to the electric chair and my oldest friend is dating the governor
I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.
You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding.
Kramer, why do you have to (noticing Newman) Hello, Newman.
My bet? All right. Ill open with a tuna sandwich.
My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin' "where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?"
(CONT'D) And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.
You know I went out once with a nude model. Never let me see her naked. Hundreds of people see her naked every week, except me. Needless to say it was quite vexing.
(livid) Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one!
So Kramer, what are you going to do?
(trying to shut the trunk hood) Something wrong with this trunk.
Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.
NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye.
All I said was I liked the pen!
(talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass.
God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?
That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?
Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.
We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, hey maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!?
You are the Queen of Confrontation. Youre my new hero. In fact, youve inspired me. Im gonna call George about something right now.
Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!
(Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the 80s, and its still relatable today.
So why don't you leave it at Newman's?
I thought it was open to the public.
Ah, so, ah, flower shows and, shopping for pretty bows, and then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight?
O.K. from now on I want you to call me "Jerry the Great".
Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.
Inka-dink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink.
(acidly) Shes full. So, Big Daddy. Im just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?
Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! Nice job on the circumcision but it's not supposed to be a finger.
Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.
(surveying the restaurant) Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it!
Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.
These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin' to make that call! (George comes in)
Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually do it)
I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway.
If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.
Shes waking down the street and it hit her in the head!
I didn't know it was possible not to know that.
Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.
(Resisting) Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I-I can't wear this!
Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.
(Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) "Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone." (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out "Just go" while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. (Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her.
I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?
I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.
Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here.
Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!
Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.
I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?
I don't know  he's got some valuable antiques, He's worried they'll break something.
(very disinterested) Hum... ok, what else you got?
Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?
Well, its a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno...
(turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isn't that your charter group?
I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.
No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.
Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets.
Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.
So how come you're not going over there for dinner?
Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.)
I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.
So George and I went up to NBC and we told them the idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract.
Elaine, he's a.. he's a male bimbo, he's a mimbo
We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.
What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police dont use them for, you know, crowd control. (Jerry crouches down, and makes like hes riding a pony.) Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, Im talking to you. Behind the barricades! So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldnt it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... Baltic, thats two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, thats it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.
I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?
And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.
Uh, how about a couple of people like us.
How could you eat fish on a plane?
Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.
You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin them whenever I want!
Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.
All right, fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone)
You stink. You know you stink. What is this?
Hey! Same initials . How do you like that?
"Hey, by the way, did you ever call that guy from the health club.?"
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?
But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship.
Um, actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet. (takes the paper back)
Ugh, the four worst words in the English language.
Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set.
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers...
That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. (goes knocking on Kramer's)
All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...
Hey Doc, check this out. [does an around-the-world with the Yo-Yo]
No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car.
This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy.
I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all.
Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'
Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?
Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!
(to himself) Once a week? (to Uncle Leo) So how's Lydia?
And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.
You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.
Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! (Kramer is speechless) I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet.
Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.
So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!
And you didnt even hear how she sounded.
Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?
The female orgasm is kinda like the bat cave, very few people know where it is and if you're lucky enough to see it you probably don't know how you got there and you can't find your way back after you left. There are two types of female orgasms, the real and the fake. And uh I'll tell you right now, as a man, we don't know. We do not know, because to a man sex is like a car accident and determining the female orgasm is like being asked 'What did you see after the car went out of control?'. 'Uh I heard a lot of screeching sounds, uh I remember I was facing the wrong way at one point. And in the end my body was thrown clear.'
I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.
But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.
You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!
No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.
Hi. Hi Winona. Nice to see you again.
Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.
(yelling) Yes I told him the Packyderm story!
Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.
She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?
Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and tear.
You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.
You know my parents are coming in and I got some clean up to do , so if you and Potsie are done scheming....
You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.
All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've flown first class, Elaine-- I can't go back to coach. I can't... I won't...
Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.
Oh yeah, well why don?t you Just get lost.
Kramer, (Trying to pass him) get outta my way!
So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.
Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.
So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial?
No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off.
(continuing to pack) That's a nice four seconds.
Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)
Just, uh, plop it on the counter there.
Okay. I'll get it. (Goes into the bedroom.)
No, I think the head does most of the stretching.
Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)
I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.
Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?
And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.
It's been known to happen....... telling you right now Elaine, this guy 's gonna dangle that dress in front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule.
You know what? That was the amazing thing.
Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!
Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.
I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.
I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man.
You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.
I mean all that stuff is so small.. ((ELAINE is wryly assessing him)) stupid..
You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.
Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?
Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.
We're in the middle of a discussion here.
Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.
I don't know, this? (Shows his neck to Sara.)
I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.
They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?
Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?
Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.
(accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?
On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?
You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS!
What do you think the worst part of being blind is?
No, no, no, it's... "She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her."
Yeah, Im sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.
Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?
Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together.
No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.
cool guy? what are you, in 8th grade?
All right. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle Arbys no more than once a month. And in exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game, and doesnt read a book.
So, you would date a married guy? That's so hacky.
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em. (starts backing away as Kramer follows him around the room carrying the underwear)
But you were supposed to get me a refund.
Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I?
Oh, nothing happened, you know, but is was great.
She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?
So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?
No kidding. (thinking) Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!
...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.
(Scoffing) Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.
I don't know how long this is gonna last.
What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?
I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So(throws away belt) thats it!
Ya sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? (Meryl laughs. The owner of the coffee shop comes over.)
The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.
A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?
(Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here.
Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?
Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.
I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.
But your were an executive, this is fast food.
Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.
Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere.
Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,
Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person.
Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.
Hey, do you know what the Whip does?
He bothers me. I dont even answer the phone anymore because of him. Hes turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.
What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?
When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.
You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.
But you know... not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me.
I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
Let me in, it's me. (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the dressing room) Here. You don't know what this is costing me. (hands Kramer the ticket)
We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.
Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town.
Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?
Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.
I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...
You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.
He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.
And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.
Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that?
Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy.
Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.
Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.
Women need to like the job of the guy theyre with. If they dont like the job, they dont like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. Well, right now, Im the regional management supervisor. Im in development, research, consulting... Men on the other hand  if they are physically attracted to a woman  are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men dont really care. Menll just go, Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? Youre just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why dont you shower up, and well get some burgers and catch a movie.
Thats different. I didnt have feelings for those people. But you, youll backslide
Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.
Yknow what? This is not that bad an idea.
Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort?
You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.
What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage death match.
No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.
Actually, we met in the gym locker room.
This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...
First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.
I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.
Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...
Yeah, dont investigate, dont pay me back, it was an accident.
Get a march goin'! March it! (She exits)
The average person in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.
In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!
Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do?
Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?
But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.
Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.
Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.
No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.
And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking?
(Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say "Hi", and I say "Hello".
Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.
(on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV for another minute) The letter, that's the letter!
[quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!
I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg." But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, "Would you mind?!"
(Stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. (Approaches the intercom) C'mon, let's get it together.. (Through intercom) Yeah?
It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
Just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces Kramer) Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!
He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.
(Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in.
Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.
Oh, The Muted Heart. Glen Close. Sally Field. Well, that should be good.
Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!
Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.
Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.
Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?
That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I got.
It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.
So lemme get this straight you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an clair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, "What the hell, I'll just eat some trash."
Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.
Ma, I told you, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan... Okay, bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Rava) My mother. She forgot how to make French toast. You know how mothers are.
All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little.
Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll uh try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. (Goes into his room, and comes back out with the jacket on.) Ahh, haven't worn this one in a long time.
Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary.
Hey, I've been back four days, I want my mail.
And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises.
You're pretty comfortable up there eh, Bubble boy?
This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.
(Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.
All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? (sits opposite George)
The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what youre doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? We have soda, we have soda, we have soda, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. Its a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and youre watching TV and youre drinking the exact same product that theyre advertising right there on TV, and its like, you know, theyre spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and Im standing there, Maybe Im putting too much ice in mine.
Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
All right, bye. (to Elaine) You see this? Any thought pops into their head they're calling me because it's a local call now.
You know what? No champagne. Anyway. . . I'll see you later.
Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?
Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.
Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.
(hands it to him as he asks ELAINE) So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?
Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.
No, no I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like the title and insisted that he change it to "War and Peace"!
Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh...
Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?
Who wouldn't like him? I like him. And I'm a guy.
Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be.
I don't even know if I remember the number.
I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.
I don't think the network will go for it.
I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that.
I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?
Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...
Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' "Where's your jock strap?" Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.
Well we went out one time. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
Thats not too bad. Its not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
I just want a, touch em a little.
(Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat.
No. So, we're still on to see uh, Firestorm tonight?
Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.
Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.
Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.
No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
Yeah, yeah. Sometimes shes on time, and... sometimes shes late.
Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?
Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations.
That's enough. (They leave. George comes around the corner.)
Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.
Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.
Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again)
Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?
Sample? (under his breath) Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book.
(bewildered) Why would she try and kill you?
So, how did you get up there? Did you say you had to use the bathroom?
Thank you very much, that's great- >click< Oh! Hold on a sec, I got a call on the other line. >click click< Hello?
Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?
Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing "no") A little taste! (still shaking) Come on. (still shaking)
That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.
Youre already moping! Would you take the place?
Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, they'll believe us.
Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??... Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women!
I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.
It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease?
Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.
Is there, something I can help you with?
Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women.
(pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you lay it out on the bed.
I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.
(Still pulling on Kramer's pants from the ankles) Man these are tight. (Yanking) Squinch your hips in
I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.
We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-
"Naaaaaa...I can't watch a man sing a song."
Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?
Its a good mirror. (They look at their menus.) So, what are you gettin?
Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this?
Now, all we gotta do is write it.
Well you've really built yourself up into something.
She was looking for someone to go to the show with.
Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy. You don't have to mention the bubble boy? I know about the bubble boy. I'm aware of the bubble boy. Why do you keep reminding me about the bubble boy?
We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?
Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?
Yeah, I know. There's no call for that kind of attitude.
I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?
I don't even think you could do it.
No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.
Yeah, so Joey?s a great lover of the opera
Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money?
No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'
I think theres a mental hospital near here.
Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?
(re the underwear pile) Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.
Hey you know we were just talking about you.
I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.
That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.
Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful.
(consternation) Oh no. (to the bedridden two) It's go time.
I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life.
Now we have to buy a new couch?!
I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck.
You didn't ... (makes motion like he's lighting a cigar)
Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.
The old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go "how do you like crotch?" If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly.
Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.
Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.
Well at least you and I are okay again.
Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--
I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.
Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes.
You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for?
You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.
How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it.
That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen -
Oh, really. (Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.)
The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal.
I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating.
No, I told you, it's just a dry run.
Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strange the whole flight?
George, I am loving this no wallet thing.
(reaching into his pocket) Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for it.
So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?
(Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there.
Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!
Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?
(proud to Peggy, under his breath) Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. (winks)
Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me?
See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'.
Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?
No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing.
uh, well I can't help you there (weakly).
That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!
All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape.
You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?
I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine!
So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo?
Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.
Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?
I was going to say, "Being a good host."
Are you sure? Oh boy, here we go.
You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.
Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?
Well, you want your organizer back don't you?
She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator...
C'mon up. (To George) Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'
Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)
Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.
Well, the pickle breath is a good start.
You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.
..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.
Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit.
I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? "Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!"
..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Packyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of (wipes his brow) pizza and uh the uh and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling em (does juggling motions) he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. (Swallows and takes a breath) Well we all just lost it. (Fulton not laughing, stone faced) It was really really funny.
You're lucky they let you drive a car.
Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business.
You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. (Picks up the phone.) She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...
(looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie "Cinderfella". I got 'em at an auction.
A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning..
Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of lobster)
No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver.
You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars.
I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.
The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
You want to get something to eat first?
I can't figure out what's going on here. I can't follow the plot. Why did they kill that guy? I thought he was with them?
But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.
Let me call him back... Hello? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.
'51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?
(coming out from the bathroom) who was it?
Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in.
Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.
Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again.
They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.
Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine.
There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.
Maybe we should get you to a hospital.
Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?
I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
Oh, I cant. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly.
Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.
And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!
I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.
Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet?
He went back? What do you mean he went back?
Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.
Not because youre dirty, not because youre clean  just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine...
No,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.
Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?
Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.
(holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.
(Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.
I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad?
Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.
To the Paul Simon concert in the park!
The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.
You're not a little anything, Newman. So just pack it up and move it out of here.
... I just got a postcard from Elaine?
Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this uh considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check?
You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
You were saying Stan? I-I'm sorry about that.
Well, your day's getting more interesting already. (Jerry shows the phone) Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.
Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.
I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.
It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.
I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?
(in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.
(on phone) Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago.
Thats not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table repeatedly.) You know, maybe its not that bad an idea.
(Joking around) Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.
(looking at the Wizard) Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents.
She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?
How can you talk to someone like that?
How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet!
(to Kramer) ...( words missing)...laugh , everything's nice and at the end of the night I go for a little contact. I get the PULL BACK. This woman said the filthiest things I've ever heard in my life. I get the Pull Back.
All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry.
Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here (points to kitchen), here (points to living room), or here (makes similar circle with his hands).
(sarcastically) Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.
You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me. He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back.. I'm putting this guy ....RIGHT OUT OF COMMISSION....
Forget that. He's a ball player. MVP< 1979. I'm making wise cracks in some night club. This guy was in game six. They're a perfect match. They like go together. They're like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.
Already? That was fast... I assume he's not a High Talker...
You know it and I ditched all my junk food.
I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!
Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.
So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.
This is no good. This is no good. Call her house.
(looking outside) Hey Newman, is that your red car?
What's even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics.
(trying to divert Vic's attention) What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that?
(Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..
Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. (George gives Elaine a look while Jerrys back is turned. Jerry turns around.) I saw that.
(to the phone) Hello yeah yes it is really ah, ah Could you hold on a second? (to George and Kramer) Hey listen to this, some woman found an electronic organizer, my name was in it, she wants me to help her track down the owner.
I will, I just walked in the door.
Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)
No, it's tarragon. Hey Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had about you having my apartment keys and everything.
(trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.
You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!
I bought you a Cadillac. (hands over the keys) Here you go.
Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.
(Stunned) No, keep it. (Elaine enters the apartment) Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.
What the hell he's supposed to be on medication I don't understand he told me he's getting medication what happened to his medication!?
No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.
[whispering] No, no news. You better get out of here.
I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.
You never really had the right comeback, anyway.
Its very good cantaloupe. (Kramer leaves; to George) So thats it? Youre out?
Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.
"You find you need to use a lot of obscenities at the dentist.
(to the phone) Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my moneys gone... Well, call me right back. (Jerry hangs up.) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasnt been home or in his office in the past three days!
Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.
Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.
Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to rides alone.
to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?
Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said "Too bad he's gay".
Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that.
We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident.
Wait a minute, that's my ticket! You didn't even want to go.
You cant go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.
Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, "You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"
A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!
What! You're the one who ruined her life.
(opens the door for George) Where did you get that?
You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little...
Right in the head! (leans in and points at Testikov)
Oh, I was just looking for er, some... gum or... mint.
That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus?
George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.
Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer!
Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.
I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.
Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?
(reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.
Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.
I had a very interesting lunch with GEORGE Costanza today.
The uh toilet brush is under the sink.
We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? (turns to George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George?
(thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And Ive still got another day! Ive got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. (to Vanessa) Thats a nice watch. Do you wind it?
Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.
Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time.
In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.
Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.
So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new guy, in a big pot of love stew.
The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the other -person.
What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy?
(Being frank) Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.
So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?
All right, forget it, forget it. Im not taking the place!
... if this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this woman to help me I would have killed this man. I would have strangled the life out of him with my bare hands
You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.
What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?
Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.
(A couple of days ago I used a public phone), go over time on the call, hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, "Yeah, operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?"
I cant blame you. I cant believe she never called you back.
Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what youre talking about, now, come on, come with me. (stands up) I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.
I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club.
Oh, alright ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....
Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?
There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...
So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?
My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? (to the intercom)
Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?
It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.
H-Hey, Kramer, wait up. I'll go with you.
Kramer! (We hear Kramer's door slam open and shut. Kramer enters. Jerry comes out of his room.) Hey! Where's all my sneakers?
Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's uh yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it?
(Trying to change the subject away from Nina) Hey - Hey Kramer, what are you doing? You want to borrow something? You want to eat something? Come on in!
I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.
A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guys got a coma going like this  you dont want to mess with it.
All right! Take it easy! Take it easy.
(Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying.
I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber.
I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
(looking at the cop) What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think he's getting coffee.!
Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!
And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
Ill have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.
(Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really?
No, I told you I admire your hearing.
"Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old married couple--" *I told you that pear was washed*!
And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?
Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up)
Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!
I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.
Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?
Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.
All right. Come on sit down. It's about to start.
Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?
Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.
All I said was "I like the pen".
I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.
Thats the bet! That youre not doing it!
(to Bania) Excuse me. (he goes back in the dressing room)
We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?
Hum, well it all comes as news to me.
(Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.
Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it.
All right, so uh, let's do something later. How 'bout a movie?
Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.
Yeah, but this is different , this is like ,you know, semi digested food stuff. You know the next stop is the stomach and you can take it from there.
Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. "Oo that little tail really turns me on."
What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I
Oh no! >click click< Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!
You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.
I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)
I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.
Well, whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.)
I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.
Well, I painted my apartment again. Ive been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, its a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize its just the thickness of the paint, but Im aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, its closer and closer. I dont even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. Thats where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control... Thats why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching TV. Thats why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there.
That voice. That voice. Shes driving me crazy.
...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.
Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.
We found out his super power was lack of money.
Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.
[forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell out of here!
(firmly matter-of-fact) Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.
I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
(taps George's chest) Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six.'
But there's no "t" in your name. What about G-bone?
I know it's a big problem.. she puts like four pieces in her mouth, it's ridiculous, I don't think we're gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine?
And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my...
So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.
But you made it through the day before.
He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything.
No, see, we didnt have ponies. Im sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..
Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.
Yeah. Im having a wonderful time. (it's obvious he isn't)
How do you stop a kid from growing?
I don't mind at all. Why should I mind? What did he say?
So how did you leave it with him?
John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.
Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.
What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?
You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.
Who do you know? He knows my hair.
No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.
Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.
Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?
Newman . Open the door, Newman, I know you're in there.
Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down. It's a business.
You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.
Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket.
No, but ah, seen any good movies lately?
Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!
I thought you said you were a good driver!
(tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back) Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.
I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.
I would like to know what my names doin in this creep's organizer to begin with.
You picked up on a vibe, from a nun.
Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.
I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.
Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.
Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.
I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.
All right. (goes into his hallway and comes back) You got my fins?
Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer. It shows at least he's making an effort.
So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on me.
Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.
How about we leave and, come back in a week?
No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.
Alright, then just get rid of it. You wont have any problem.
(to Rava) So, wheres this boyfriend of yours? I cant wait much longer. Ive got a flight.
So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these types of people.
Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die.
May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" across the painting)
Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out.
Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.
I think it has something to do with me.
Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this.
Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.
(Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla.
Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno.
I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?
(walking over the the buzzer to answer it) Oh, that's the Flicks.
Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?
I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.
He's been sleeping a lot. He's still groggy.
The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.
Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.
No, believe me it's not good. I'll mail you a new one with something really funny written on it.
I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?
Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!
(seeing that Kramer has a new watch) What's that?
(in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine) So did you figure out Darryl's... you know.
Maybe I didnt want to talk to him.
What do you need a job, you got Audrey.
Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.
The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.
I don't know. (takes off his sweater) This sweater really itches me. You want it?
(to George) You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.
We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.
Well, thats a lot of money. But, if thats the way its gotta be, thats the way its gotta be.
(on the phone) Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.
(placatory) Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me.
Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer enters)
(He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.
Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.
At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.
No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.
Wow! Hey, theres Clare. I better go down.
And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.
I dont know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three oclock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someones door and tell them to keep it down? Youre really altering your whole self-image. I mean, what am I, Fred Mertz now? Whats happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. Theres a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh... shh... shhh... shhh... Doesnt work, cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me. Some people you cant shush in a movie theater. Theres always that certain group of people, isnt it? Theyre talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They wont shush. Theyre the unshushables.
No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. Whats important is you two getting back together. Eh, then well talk about the car.
He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?
You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.
And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.
I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going "I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?
Get in the car! Get in the car!
(stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored)
Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. (To Kramer) I never should have cashed those checks!
What if she's got no interest in you?
(Takes the bottle from him) Just swallow 'em.
Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.
You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!
I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.
I thought you just said she doesn't know??
(To Guard) I just wanted you to scare him.
Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?
She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love!
I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.
But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.
Course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.
So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?
Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?
What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.
Hey, were kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?
No!!! The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him, you break his spirit!
Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...
I'm gonna get that. (walks across the set towards the blue curtain)
Oh, great. Ok we'll goin' away. I think I'm excited.
Hey, hey. uh Pamelas birthday party, didnt I see you there? Jerry.
I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.
No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.
I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?
You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal(sp?) before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.
I'm not a foodie. I don't, "Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty." Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book. What is this? The story of the bill? "Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.." What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating from the restaurant? What is this about?
(Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.
Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
The apple pie you had today at Monks
What are you doing? Were going out to dinner in ten minutes.
Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--
All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?
Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here.
...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're there approving new clothes.....That's a girlfriend job! How dare he!!
I don't know, but we don't have much time.
You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
Hey look at this. What is going on here?
Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. >click click<
I think I may have made a big mistake.
(stopping them) We better not. (they make out some more; then stop) T-They're gonna be here any second.
We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.
The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.
Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency.
Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?
I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.
(impressed) Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.
I'll see you tonight. (he's opening his door apartment as Kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe)
Make sure you get this area here, where he needs the help....
Anyway, you know why I didnt ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab.
(To Amy) Aha! So it's true! You were making out with him!
Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!
So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day?
With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.
Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.
Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.
I know. Im really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.
Golden Boys always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry. Here... touch Golden Boy!
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.
Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to an open box) isn't that one of yours?
Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that canvas?
(hangs up the phone) Yeah, I really needed that suit.
(after the guy) You think you're better than me?
Nah, I dont go for these non-refundable deals. I cant commit to a woman. Im not going to commit to an airline.
Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie.
Girls. There's girls right here in the store. Look, look, there's one over there. Look, there's another one. Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there. What's the matter?
(impatiently cutting in) Hey Elaine What about the crest.? What d'you think of the crest here.
You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there.
(arriving at apartment, sees Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from Kramer's) So you live right... there.
Yeah, but how could you be so sure?
You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!
But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?
That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's.
Hey, get out of here...hey officer, he's fooling around back here.
No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.
Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George.
(Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything?
Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.
(Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My, isn't this an awkward moment?
Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.
If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?
No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.
So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.
Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.
We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.
I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!
It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?
You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't remember anything about you.
Where do you suppose that could've come from?
(Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did!
Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10?
Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...
I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?
Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. (indicating) Come on in. You got the cigars?
Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?
Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs phone up)
Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why dont you just settle it like mature adults?
Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.
I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.
Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And Ill need that in the form of a question.
I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.
I saw one once that could do sign language.
Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?
Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....
She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply)
Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her!
You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.
No, we don't care, we just want to go.
So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?
No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?
I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back.
Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.
(acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?
He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.
No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?
So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.
I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble. I'll do it myself.
SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya! (the inter- com buzzes) Yeah?
Never. (The elevator door opens.) Wait a second. Thats her. On the right.
Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...
And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?
I'm gonna go let Elaine in. (Kramer reaches out to stop him leaving)
Yeah, Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would you describe Kramer's hair?
Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.
See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.
Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll *all* be over...
That's not going to be good for anybody.
Have you noticed people staring at your head?
Look Ramon, about the other day. Im sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway.
Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.
You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're lifting heavy suit cases.
He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. (Mimics brushing his teeth) Away from the gums... (The door opens a little, George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and Elaine, then enters.)
(to George) Snow. Snow, that cant be good for suede, can it?
I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?
(Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.
Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.
Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
(on the phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second. (George walks in  Jerry asks George) So we definitely dont want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes his head NO) Alright, were back together again, great. Bye bye.
We cold play Sorry! We cold play Steal the Old Mans Bundle. (Vanessa not amused; Jerry thinking) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to Vanessa) What kind of perfume is that youre wearing?
I really think you're making too much of this.
Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.
What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What are you Peter Lorre?
NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.
I like that. (He opens the closet. Elaine walks out with an angry look.) What do you think, George?
Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?
Dirt? That's alright, (for Jenna's benefit) because there's nothing wrong with dirt.
If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld.
I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.
Oh my god! Look what's goin' on here! She is depraved! (Grabs a towel and brings it to Lena.) There you are.
Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for? I don't know about that, I'll have to think about it. I'll let you know. Okay, bye.
What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming "There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!" And then, when they all run into the other direction, we'll jump in the car!
(Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!
Yeah, I think it is. (They walk toward the man. Jerry hesitates.) Wheres Elaine?
You want to spend the rest of your life with her
So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box.
I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?
Relax, hes late. Hes always late. Its part of his M.O.
Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.
Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.
Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!
Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, thats a good idea.
Well, I brought them up there to take his records--
Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it.?
You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 950, I'm not gonna be able to make it!
(leafing through his mail) Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.
[mockingly] "Please hurry". Look at you. Look at what you've become.
No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.
We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
It would be nice to care about someone.
Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?
Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?
Im not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll em down below my knee?
Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.
Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?
Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun.
I mean it's a terrible mistake, I mean he thinks I ruined some deal of his at NBC, I don't know anything about any deal at NBC.
So you want to catch a movie later?
Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.
Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?
Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I?
Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good things.
No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing. (Jerry picks up the phone and dials the number) I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?
Oh, yes. Particularly if youre not in it.
Yours?....You know what I'll think I'll brush later.
Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
Excuse me.( gets up and opens the door)
Come on, Go in, go in! [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again]
(Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after him!
If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.
A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.
I would know if I had a blender.
Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...
The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!
Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?
No, gore-tex. It's new. (Checks his pockets.) Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that.
This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.
Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?
Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this?
Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?
He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.
I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.
Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may depend on it.
I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.
Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if its done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels!
(to Kramer) Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot.
Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?
They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give!
Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. Alright, it's time to go. Come on.. Up.
I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.
I am not gonna taste your peach. I ate some one's pecan last night, I'm not gonna eat your peach.
What do I say if he picks up?
I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.
George, this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on. (Jerry leaves.)
Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me (flustered, he indicates a nose pick)
Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?
When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion.
You wanna go with me up to (clap) the Bronx and see if there's any flyers on George's car.
(Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.
I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need "the clown" in his title, as clown? Bozo, "the" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...
Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men.
So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.
So what about the "Maestro" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.
So, ah, what are you doing around here Ramon?
Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?
You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this jockey and the jockey got off the horse and started chasin' him.
Yes, but lets just stop it right there.
Uh, again? (Limping towards the door) I'll be right there.
What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!
Im meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.
"No no you said George likes spicy chicken."
It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.
Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited.
I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I - I don't even remember the name of the town.
That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his fathers band. Hed loan it to you.
Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.
What are we doing out here? Aren't we going to go in and eat?
Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.
Have you thought any more about that trip?
Vandelay Industries, Kel Varnsen speaking. May we help you? ... Oh Hi Keith. Na, I was just jokin' around
Uh, I don't know, we used to go out.
No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1,900 dollars.
I said I couldnt believe you liked that commercial. So what?
(Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!
(sound of gunfire) Pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, Pkeeew!
(thinks) Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize?
Yeah. What's wrong, why? ( George runs back to the bathroom)
I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?
You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.
But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there, "Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin. Well I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on."
Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a, its a little crumpled.
Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.
Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?
I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?
They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.
The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.
(defensive) At least it was just the handle!
(Walks over and starts pulling on Kramer's pants) You just gotta wiggle your hips a little bit.
(gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!
Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?
Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)
This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little off.
Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.
Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?
Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket.
You know, what you need is a song you can share.
who do you think she is? how dare she? you want me to get the manager? too bad they don't have those old ladies walking around with flashlights anymore we'd flush her out
(Like an Army general) Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys.
...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.
Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin?
No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.
(talking to Beth on the phone) Could you put him on, I'd love to say hello.
Well, then Im not going to the game either. Okay? Ill give him both tickets.
Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.
Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!
Thats comforting. Shh. Hes coming. (to Ray) Ray?
Alright, I'll change my shoes. (Heads back to his apartment. George follows.)
No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.
Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business thing...
Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!
So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?
It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library
Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!
Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it.
Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your..
This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.
One of the problems in life is that when youre a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, I got the front seat I wanted the front seat! I called it. And the other kid knows hes got nothing to say He called it. What can I do? If there was a Kid Court Of Law, it holds up. Your Honour, my client did ask for the front seat And the judge would go, Did he call it? Well no, he didnt call- BANG! (Jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled.
(Excited) I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!
And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.
Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!
Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.
I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!
What, are you serious...why, why did she call?
I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.
Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit.
Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.
I said yes, but I don't feel right about it. I mean I hardly know the guy. That's a big step oin a relationship. The biggest. That's like going all the way.
(Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) I didn't say anything.
(into phone) Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. (to George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!
Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go.
I don't have your suit. I gave it away.
[rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your point!
No, I dont eat dinner. Dinners for suckers.
Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer.
Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?
Now thats not fair! So where did you meet this guy?
Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?
Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh...
So I dont know what shes using it for.
Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guys out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, its true, men hear a drill, its like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, Honey, I think Jims working on something over there. So they run over to the guy. Now they dont actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. Thats what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, What are you using, a Phillips-head? You know, we feel involved. Thats why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, thats just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they dont cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, thatll hold.
You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.
You know, we never had one fight before this deal.
No, no. It-It's really funny. There's these two guys-
Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though.
You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... (he spots a mailman crouched emptying a box) Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.
So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.
Especially when you got a layover in Sarajevo. (Bosnia Herzegovina)
Dont you think she woulda heard I was there?
Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.
(On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.
I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?
He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.
Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.
Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?
W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.
Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job.
Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.
(To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.
Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read.
You know, instead, Im like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.
Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail.
Oh...yeah...uh you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.
You got a little shmootz there (picks something on her sweater)
Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him )
Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot.
What do you think the Nazis were doin? (Imitates the Nazis salute) That was the heil-five.
Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.
Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.
What do you mean you're in the same class?
So youre saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, its all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.
Nope, the cop says its my word against his. Theres nothing they can do.
That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.
(Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled "Ori-dent") Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!
In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.
All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you.
You what?! Get out! (pushes Kramer) Ten thousand?
Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I?m serious, I?m not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.
Ah, I should have got the egg white omelet.
What are you so worried about this for?
Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.
Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model.
I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...
Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?
Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give it back to me.
Id rather not say it out loud. Its embarrassing.
Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...
You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.
Alright, Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.)
Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!
She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.
What do you mean? They know we're here.
Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. (The door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
"The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour". I'm confused.
First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?
I didnt tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog?
Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.
50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.
We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! Well be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life.
Yes, come on! How often do you get engaged? Come on!
Don't you ever talk about her like that!
Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car so I don't toss it in that dumpster?
You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.
Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.
But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?
You're going out with the stationery store guy?
Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that?
It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.
Now, I should tell you that, at this point, she's under the impression that youre - a - ah
So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?
And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry)
Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation.
Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea.
I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.
You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?
Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery.
Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it.
(Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!
I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.
Did you see the look on that guy's face?
Well, if I hear an anguished "oink", I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look (HE POINTS AT PASSERBY) Human, human, human... (HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR, WITH ALARM.) (WITH MOCK ALARM) Wait a second! (Grabs Kramer)
Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to go?
There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.
Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?
(answering, quickly) If you know what happened in the Met game, dont say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, Im sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no
How you gonna get out of *that* one?
Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand and put it on his shoulder)
I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, "Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me." But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?
...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, "Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now." "This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration." You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration, (waves imaginary wallet) "Here's fifty-six people that know me." Cop goes. "Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check."
I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?!
(to Morty) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street!
What is this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesnt fit him).
So you're not gonna come back to New York with us?
uh uh because then it would be all grown up.
I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked.
So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?
I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different... sources.
Donna, really, youre making too much of this.
The captain of the toes. (phone rings) Hello.
If you need more time, you should have more time.
I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.
No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, hes treatin me just like a regular customer, now!
The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)
I can't believe she threw out my napkin.
"Of course.... But that's got nothing to do with it."
(sarcastically) Yeah, Levine. And Im Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.
Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) "Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."
Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)
I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night only, the big screen. My hands are tied!
Hey, hey, what are you doing, that?s my quarter.
What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?
Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. (Joel shakes his head agreeing; Jerry smiles) You know, its their annual terrorist luncheon.
(Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.
(apologetically) Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.
Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?!
Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.
(to Elaine) I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog. (to George) Get this one "I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest".
These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you?
Hi. Hi. Look, I don't know what you think --
You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.
I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.
Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in.
George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods)
No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.
A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?
You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.
Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.
She wanted to thank us for the apartment.
Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. Its the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... (Jerry pushes the door shut.) ...MUST BE CLOSED!!
I'll pick you up at your apartment. We'll go to the Eight.
We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie.
Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?
No more crutches, that must be a relief.
(reading) 'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie, hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'
Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men
No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!
He doesn't even care if a man answers.
Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?
(seeing Kramer struggle to open a soda, spilling it all over) I think the damage is probably already done. (interrupting Kramer's inadequate attempt to clean up the soda) All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene.
He's a boy who lives in a bubble.
Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read. I was wondering if-
All the time. Ive been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I cant live like this. I dont know what Im gonna do. Im heading for breakdown! (to Harold) Cant you do something?
Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact with --
Cops eating Milanos. What crazy town is this?
And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.
Oh, did you get that outta my bag?
Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?
(animated) Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and you sold a Cadillac?!
It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.
Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes.
Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.
Wait a minute! (A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.)
Oh, well, I didnt actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into him there. (putting on coat)
All right, I'll see you after school. I,,m late for Hayman's hygiene.
So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.
You better finish your little caf latte there. They won't let you in with it.
Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, "Photographs - Do not bend".
(Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing is now?? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!
(Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So, the last person in should close the door!
I mean I met her three times. I dont even know her last name.
I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting.
What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?
See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.
Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. and we got to talking, he sells Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.
Ah, dinner! Thats it, youre all the way back!
You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.
No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!
Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned it...
Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . What could he do?
(more disgusted) Ohhhh! You cant! Its impossible! Theres no break in the conversation where you can go, All right then... You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.
Hey ya know I read an unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the other day, did you know the original title for "War and Peace" was "War--What Is It Good For?"!
You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.
Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.
Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.
I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?
I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.
Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in your friend John Germaine's band there.
(thinking; quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression 'The best revenge is living well' I've said this, in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice, doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him, 'Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting, french doors, a divan. That'll show those punks.'
Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.
No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it. (thinks out loud, opens phone book) Becker, ... Becker, ...
Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our prices, we'll give you the store.
(to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?
Okay.. (Opens the door to a frantic Elaine)
I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!
Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.
(Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.
Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you.
Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?
Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.
My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.
I, I'm not happy with what I wrote.
(after Bookman exits) That is one tough monkey! (turns to Elaine) So you were saying?
Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.
My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!
(He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.
You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?
(Chuckles) You don't know the half of it.
Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.
I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?
Well you should hear the message from my nut. Where's George and Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, I feel very vulnerable.
What is that? (Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.)
So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?
Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.
Kramer, they're fumigating. There's toxic gas in there.
Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it.
Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.
Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?
Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?
No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald cure.
Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going "Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going."
(to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)
This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.
It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes the door) Give me that back.
If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.
No I can't I've got some stuff to do then I've got to meet Keith at my apartment at three. I'm helping him move.
Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves, wanted to come home and start working on his floor.
Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do.
"I don't think so. I think they were getting dressed and not only that; my shirt was out!!!"
Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?
So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't?
There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.
(taking a catalog) Can I have one? I need one of those old-looking phones. So you wanna grab a bite?
Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.
Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!
Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)
Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex.
So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?
You want to go to Mendys, Ill take you to Mendys.
OK ... (nodding his head up and down) This is it cha know
Look, its a very awkward situation. I dont wanna be presumptuous.
Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.
Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?
(to the phone) Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you- Oh, Hi. Joel... Oh, you just came in... Listen, I cant make it to the game tonight... I, uh, have to tutor my nephew... Yeah, hes got an exam tomorrow... Geometry... You know, trapezoids, rhombus... Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. Theyre at the Will-Call window... And Im really sorry... Have a good time... Well talk next week... Okay... Yeah, I dont... Fine.. Fine... Bye.
What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. (acts like he did in the movie) Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. (does the next look) I mean, beyond that, Im risking a punch in the mouth. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?
Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person -
So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--
Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it?
George? (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.
I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!
Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.
I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
You know I can't get this *damn thing* to sleep. (about the Yo-Yo)
All right. (opens door - Red light floods hallway - a buzzing sound emanates.)
Im gonna make an appointment for you. Well go together.
Expecting Newman? That's funny because I just happened upon him down at the Kenny Roger's Roasters.
Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?
Babu? Babu...[waves Babu to come to table] Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just, it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?
What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?
Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.
I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.
oh.. uh.. you know your breath is a little garlicky you better take some gum.
But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!
So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.
No, shes a little too cheery for me.
Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?
So, I guess you dont find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?
Alright, sit down, sit down. (Grabs a pill from the bottle, and starts advancing tward Kramer - like an owner with his dog)
I think thats the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!
Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.
Oh, no. I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with it.
You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!
Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. "I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa " Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... (Naomi exits) it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality.
Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.
(answering the phone) Hello? Yeah, the van is still for sale. Sure, come on buy.
Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up)
Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal.
No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.
Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?
Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.
(looking at the TV) Look at the picture on this thing...
I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from.
Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.
Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.
I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.
I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.
We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.
But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment shes going right for that machine.
Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy.
Pretty good. I think she might be the one.
It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.
Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.
He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story??
All right, go, it's a race! Come on!
You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!
The dating world is not a fun world...its a pressure world, its a world of tension, its a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I dont know what they need. I know I dont have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one Im- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, were all human beings, what is the story? Ive never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, Ive never been in a situation, when I thought to myself I could use a cotton-ball right now. I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they dont need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, theyre like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? Theyre huge and two days later, theyre out, theyre gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin with them? The only time I ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, theres two or three, that look like theyve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I dont know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl whos left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I dont know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. Lets move on. The dating world is a world of pressure. Lets face it a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance youll end up naked at the end of it. You know? Well, Bill, the boss thinks youre the man for the position, why dont you strip down and meet some of the people youll be workin with?
(to the Drake) Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye...
Well, what do you think the big holdup is?
(giving him a steak from the fridge) Here ya go.
Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you.
Yeah. a-hu. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?
well aside from that from that, how did he like the sandwiches?
Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.
I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go "Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!"
But then I found out about the skin cancer.
Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.
Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over my side.
(Pointing) But are you still master of your domain?
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?
So you want me to get the books? Is that it?
Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?
I can't believe your a friend of mine.
Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, "This is good, who is this? I like this person". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, (pretending to wake up) "Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!"
Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.
Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
(to Elaine) Where's Kramer? Shouldn't he be here by now.
I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?
Fasten your seat belts. we're goin' to see the baby.
Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop, clip clop. They're nuts for it.
Are saying you're banning me from the store?
Anyway, I don't need your help. (Turns to leave.)
Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?
That orange dress is burned in my memory
(to George) Hey, there's Pat. (calls) Hey, Pat.
Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way.
Oh (laughing) Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting.
Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.
And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.
Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.
There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts.
She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?
Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
Uh, hang on a second, You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck.
Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?
The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.
Why'd you have to say anything to her?
You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?
all right lets be reasonable, Bania. Im taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal.
Oh, they're all the same. Here. [gives him Dust Buster] Now if you'll excuse us, ..
Let me tell you something Babu. You go back in that kitchen -- tell your chef I want the works.
No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.
Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.
This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?
I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club...
Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?
Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits on a couch.) Hey, what about this one?
Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?
Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.
So, what are you up for? How about Mexican?
Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?
Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy.
Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'
I dont really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because theres that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, youre sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, Im really sorry about this. I dont know why I left that stuff over there. And thats why I could never be a maid, because Id have an attitude. Id find them, wherever they are in the house, Oh, I suppose you couldnt do this? No, dont get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldnt dust. No, this is too tough, isnt it?
Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.
Listen, Joel, I dont think we should see each other anymore.
In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.
I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy could write checks to himself right out of my account.
Y'know a lot of people have asked that...
I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
It's not even my car, it's a rental.
(examining) Hey George, you know what? I think this crest is different. It's got a moose on it.
(Trying to read the note) What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit.
Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.
(finishing) The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.
Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit) And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.
Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?
Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much. (To Kramer) I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!
Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???
What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?
(Fishing for his keys in a kitchen drawer) You know, when I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time.
No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter (pauses) Oh no!
What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods.) Did he tell you whats gonna happen? (George shakes his head.) How long were you there?
(Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.
Hey I don't even want the pen now!
You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?
Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)
(Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 'French Impressionist Paintings'?
(quiet) Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..
Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.
(flips a roll of paper towels in the air) Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.
Come on up . (looks at his watch) ...What's he doing here now?
(on phone) Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act (pauses for response from Adrian) No new material (Elaine enters) He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week, it killed. (waves hello to Elaine; pauses for response from Adrian) Thank you, thanks fo.. you will not regret this. Ok, Bye. (hangs up phone; to Elaine) Hey.
Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
But you yada yada'd over the best part.
No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I wouldve said tonight.
No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.
To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go "Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch." According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.
No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.
Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?
(Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here..
(shrugs) Hey George I think I want to bring a date to the wedding
She's the model I met on the plane.
Understand you had a little talk with him too.
You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?
I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright, I'm dropping you off at work, right?
It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
Just put a coffee table book over it.
Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit?
Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. (Newman considers the implications of this.)
Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So...
She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.
I know exactly whats gonna happen tonight. Im gonna try and act like Im not impressed, hes gonna see right through it.
Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?
(under breath) Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..
Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..
(disbelief) So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?!
(Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.
(pointing at the operation he mouths the words) Did it go in?
Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.
I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something.
(To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom buzzes) That's Elaine. (Kramer buzzes her in. Jerry talks into the phone) Kramer.. (To Kramer) George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.
A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?
You know, if your future was a little more certain..
Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!
Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?
What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says " Aw, I'll just have some coffee." There's no truth to that.
You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?
Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!
That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?
So, Im on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the...
Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this? (moves his arm) He's gonna think you're a mental patient.
No, I kinda tried to test his hearing.
Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?
Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.
Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, "Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms."
Aren't you going to take the check down?
The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.
Just get the key and let's get out of here.
We don't hear that. (They enter the elevator)
No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!
What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying...
You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?
I don't believe this. (They run into theater)
Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.
Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.
OK, fine. 'What do I have to do to put you in this van today?'
Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the etiquette?
Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.
(to Kessler) Yeah. (to the phone) Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem.
So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought.... And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me.
Oh, well here. Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it again.
How long did you leave it up there?
No appointments at all? (motions to Elaine to move over)
Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.
Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.
So Whatley sayd to me, "Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic."
(Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.
Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
We won. Were in the finals on Wednesday.
Same as you cant overwet. You see, once something is wet, its wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die youre dead, right? Lets say you drop dead and I shoot you. Youre not gonna die again, youre already dead. You cant overdie, you cant overdry.
Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.
Yeah... hes specializing in whales. He's working on lowering the cholesterol level, in whales all that blubber -- quite unhealthy. You know its the largest mammal on earth but as George says "they don't have to be."
Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your guy?
(CONT'D) What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.
Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)
You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events.
You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.
While you were in jail. So you're free.
An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. (Elevator doors open) Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. (Everyone but Jerry is now in the elevator. Jerry's still addressing them) Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?! (Elevator doors shut. A few people in the hallway are looking at him, he turns and addresses them) I am not an animal!
Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?
Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not, a chicken.
You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.
Where did you come up with all that stuff?
Here. Take a look. What, what is that?
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
I suppose if it was on the protg's way to the mentor, they might.
So, tell me anyway. Who was the BIG mastermind?
U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you?
(Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.
They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
(to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here.
That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this, okay...
I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?
I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a "magical world" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.
(in a tuxedo) So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a woman that won't have sex with you.
In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?
Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (Jerry smiles. George laughs.) So, how's the book coming? (George's laughs taper off...) I say, how's the book comin'?
Oh, what about this one? Look at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for. (Sits on the couch.) Oh, yeah!
Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.
Well, if that's not that, what is that?
So why didn't you tell her the code?
How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?
No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car.
Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.
You, sidle? Y-You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!
Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?
Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and put it in.
Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.
You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe its Manage A Trois.
The main thing is to keep the line moving.
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.
Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?
All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?
youre a real pleasure. (Jerry is being sarcastic)
Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.
She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.
So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?
Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage from her yet!
Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case.
You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.
So get this we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.
Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.
So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.
Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something.
Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo.
Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.
(picks up phone) Hello? (listens) Oh, hi Mr. Pitt.
Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.
(to Kramer) So how's your karate class going?
That's a hell of an organization they're running up there. I can't understand why they haven't won a pennant in 15 years.
I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. Shes going to move in.
No, I actually find you quite charming. A bit verbose at times...
He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.
(Trying to get rid of her) Yes, I think it's a fine idea. Well, good night.
(yell) Move to the back of the drawers!
This has 'international incident' written all over it.
I dont know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I cant decide.
I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing.
Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal [and, ala Carson] Wild, Wild, Stuff...
(To cashier) I'd like to speak with the manager, please.
Its great! It speeds up the intimacy level. Its like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish (snaps his fingers) three days.
So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?
I was. But, shes got me, like, hypnotized.
Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.
Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do some TV spots for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store. That was Leapin' Larry himself, I'm gonna meet with him tomorrow.
I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.
Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.
Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.)
Come in for two minutes and sit with me.
(reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.
But that is not what they would have you believe.
I thought you were gonna watch a video.
(emphatic) I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!
Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?
The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?
Good question. (More to himself than to Elaine) Why are we calling?
No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I dont know her name.
Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!
I mean, she called me. I havent called her. She started it.
So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?
Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.
All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier. (Elaine drinks straight out of the orange juice container) Hey.
I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!
She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.
Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there.
You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.
The crook has the machine. The messages arent for him. Hes the crook. Why would he answer- (Jerry gives up on the explanation and turns around to see George standing behind him.) How did you get in here?
(answering machine) leave a message and I?ll call you back, thanks. JOE DIVOLA Jerry, Joe Divola. *Pbt* *Pbt* *Pbt* I have a hair on my tongue, I can't get it off, you know how much I hate that? Course you do, you put it there. I know what you said about me Seinfeld. I know you badmouthed me to the execs at NBC, put the kibosh on my deal. Now I?m gonna put the kibosh on you. You know I?ve kiboshed before, and I will kibosh again.
(to the Drake) Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. (To Elaine) Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?
Yes. I do love her. (to baby) You have a very nice place here.
(to George) That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.
Were you crying? I mean, its just a grape. Youll find it.
Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Jerry hugs Kramer, then grabs him by the cheeks.) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think Im in the clear here. Elaines not moving in. I dont have to confront her. She has no idea I never wanted her to move in. Im golden!
There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?
All right, all right, I?ll wear this. It's bad enough I?ve got to go to the opera I?ve got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here.
(CONT'D) You want me to help you with that?
(Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.
(in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.
He yells and you don't get your soup.
How do you know she's not my wife?
Well you said they could come and take the records.
Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time.
(TO KRAMER, REBOX) Will you let me help you with that?
It was just an innocent comment! I didnt know she had a pony!
Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?
The % thing to do is just not think about it.
But you gotta know how to work the projector.
You know what? I'll be with you in a minute.
Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god. Wel-- how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud.
Look, I gotta try and help the guy.
Yeah , she's coming to see my act tonight.
Yeah. (thinking) That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. (decisive) I'm gonna do it.
Coach to India - The only way to go.
I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?
They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again.
No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?
No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-
(Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?
Im not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. Ive decided Ill do the work. Im gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? Cause you send your money out there  working for you  a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me. Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.
I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?
Oh, oh take it back. Let's get another one.
This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.
Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?
Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.
Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?
Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?
Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.
How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!
It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.
(Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.
(to waitress) I' ll just have a cup of coffee.
I'm laying down! Then we'll see how he does up there, without all the assistance.
Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, No egg white omelets. Look at that.
(Confirming) An alliance. (They both shake hands and laugh evily) Now get the hell outta here. (Newman leaves)
It's this one here in the back. (Tilts his head back, and knocks Elaine's trophy out the window. A loud hissing sound and commotion is heard from the street below. Everyone runs to the windows to look.)
What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?
Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference who's tall. We're all tall.
I have to go over to my grandmother's.
So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right?
I did not. You guys gonna go through some red lights?
I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave.
That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?
What do you mean they're not going to do anything, they're the cops, they gotta do something, he just put the kibosh on me, do you know what the kibosh means, its a kibosh!
So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.
Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it?
See ya. (Jane Leaves; after the door closes Kramer jumps in shock) what's with you?
(Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven!
But you did actually throw his coat out the window.
That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.
Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.
What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up.
Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.
Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.
Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.
All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?
What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?
(opening the door) Well, it was nice meeting you.
Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine.
Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?
Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?
My whole night's ruined. I didn't do any sets, didn't do any movies...
What happened you didn't give her the papers?
(pulling out a tape from his pocket) Vvvvup. Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your feet up?
OUR LIVES!! . What kind of lives are these? We're like children. We're not men.
Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.
Ohh ... (takes the ticket and heads for the dressing room)
Okay, how about this I'm in my apartment, you come in.
Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.
Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.
You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the "Astonishing Tales of Costanza".
It's stuck. (pained) Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood.
It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.
You should have her work on it for you.
Elaine, how about this shirt? Is this okay?
But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full.
Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it.
Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?
Yknow Im sorry you had to leave so early the other night.
I'm going to the hospital to see Fulton. I'm not even saying hello, I'm going right into material.
Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.
Oh, that guy was your cousin! (walking in front of George so he gets the picture to leave)
Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?
Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.
A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.
They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?
He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?
What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.
You told me that already like two months ago.
I think the thing I admire most about the Chinese is that they're hanging in there with the chopsticks. Because, if you think about it, you know, they've seen the fork... by now. I'm sure they've seen the spoon, they're going, "Yeah, yeah, they're OK... We're going to stay with the sticks." I mean, I don't know how they've missed it, thousands of years ago, Chinese farmer gets up, has his breakfast with the chopsticks, goes out and works all day in the field with a shovel... Hello?... Shovel! Not going out there ploughing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues.
Uh-huh, yeah. (Smiling, nodding, clearly wanting Bryant to shut up)
D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?
Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.
Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?
Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.
I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..
All right. That's it, I can't work like this.
(in the hallway, hearing the door lock behind him, turns back) Kramer!
Well, I-I-I told my wife not to bring it.
(Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off George, and puts it back on his bed)
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.
(ironic outrage) The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!
Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.
I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!
All right, that's not bad. Now get over here!
That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.
(Interrupts) Excuse me...Excuse me... Are you asking him out ?
Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?
Great talkin' to you. (Nina leaves. To himself) What the hell is e-mail?
Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!
Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!
Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.
Vanessa, thank you. Ive been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.
Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.
Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.
Back and to the left Back and to the left
You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!
Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. (opens the fridge and gets a bottle of water.)
Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself.
If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. Hes always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess its because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.
You know last time you had me throwin' a rye bread up three floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off your car, where does it end?!?
Oh, heh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.
No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.
Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.
Im not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want.
Why did you force that mint on me? I told ya I didn't want the mint!
I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.
(hanging up the phone) Oh! There's my Chinese food, I gotta run. All you.
Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.
Honey, what'd you do with the can opener?
First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.
And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She says, "That's funny." ... That's funny!
You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal.
Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.
How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!
(Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical..
Because you were too busy stealing a book.
What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it.
Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks.
So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
(noticing a coffee table book) Oh, you got the Civil War book. I saw some of that show, it was wonderful.
Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.
I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.
Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up!
The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.
Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.
Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!
Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- Zip, I'm gone. (makes a running motion with both arms and his right foot)
You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...
What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present)
There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a "Smell Gestapo". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush...
But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!
(to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.
Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?
Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin?
(thinking) Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?
Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.
Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because moneys a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you dont care about money when youre hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, youre like the ruler of an empire. More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives. Then after the meal, you know, youve got the pants open, youve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. Theyre mystified by the check. What is this? How could this be? They start passing it around the table, Does this look right to you? Were not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?
Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.
Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a men's room. That's the end of that.
So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.
Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?
(proud of himself) Remember me? I said I 'd come back with someone and I did. Surprised?.
Widower? Wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research)
Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.
(Joking around) I think it's the stench of death.
Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?
Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.
Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
(adamant) No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back.
You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?
There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.
Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.
How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?
Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.
Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?
Hey ,You think that Shelly's upset that I made such a big deal about the pecan.
Jim Fowler? The animal guy from "Wild Kingdom" is coming to your apartment?
Listen, Matthew, I-I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do.
Anyway Beth, you know i was thinking on my way over how when i was 9. I wanted these handball sneakers, they were all black but they came in adult sizes so you know i never got the sneakers. (Beth looks him confused)
(Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?
I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'?
Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?
We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it?
I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.
This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.
You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.
I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!
Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on?
Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!
Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind.
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. ! Celebrate! How about some champagne?
Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.
I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.
All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.
Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.
Look Kramer, i-i-if I'm gonna live over there, y-y-you gotta take some of this stuff out. I mean this thing is really freaking me out (holds up a ventriloquist dummy). I feel like its gonna come to life in the middle of the night and kill me.
Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.
I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?
Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises?
Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.
It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.
Yeah. Specifically 930 shows. Seen any good 930 shows at the Paragon, Willie?
You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.
How could she not tell me where she was staying?
Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?
...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.
(adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.
It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
(Nervous laughter) Yeah.. like a pirate.. (Attempting to get on another subject) Anyway, ah, you know, we're hoping to, um, raise enough money.. with this.. uh..
That?s what I?ll do, I?ll just call him and tell him, I?ll tell him. That?s all I?ll do. He's a human being, I?ll talk to him. He'll understand. Right?
I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.
I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.
Hello,  oh hi Elaine .. what's going on  no he just left  you broke up with him?  ME TOO .. what happened?  oh smoking you know you're like going out with C. Everet Coope  me  nah  I couldn't go through with it  I just didn't feel ready  so what are you doing now?  Oh, great idea, I'll meet you there in like thirty minutes. Okay bye.
Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.
I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I? (throws coat over his right shoulder)
You gotta go to my chiropractor, hes the best.
Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.
Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.
Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.
If there's a serial killer lose in your neighborhood, it seems like the safest thing is to be the neighbor. They never kill the neighbor. The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right? "Oh, he was kind of quiet." I love these neighbors. They're never disturbed by the sounds of murdering, just stereo. Chain saws, people screaming, fine. Just keep the music down. And all these women who always fall in love with the serial killer. They write to him in prison. Here's a woman that's hard to disappoint. I guess she's only upset when she finds out he's stopped killing people and she goes "You know sometimes I feel like I don't even know who you are anymore".
Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! Its a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!
Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls down, make it an eight room luxury suite.
What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.
All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now.
That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!
Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over this whole operation!
I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot.
(animated) You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I...
Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to 'em. Mind if I walk through real quick?
Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.
Oh. (notices a car being jacked up by a tow truck) Hey, isn't this Kramer's car? (yelling up) Hey, Cosmo!! They're towing your car!!
How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable special . I 've never gotten a cable special.....well that's it I'm not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado. (to the silent Kramer on the couch beside him) ...Exactly.
So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.
I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? Thats what I want to know. I mean, its the championship, Im hitting everything.
so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?
On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?
(opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?
Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for show.
Why do I have to go on the tour?
Well, Im sure you did. Who wouldnt love a pony? Who wouldnt love a person that had a pony?
(Fast) Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me!
Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!
Why don't you go to another nail shop?
No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.
Do you have to write all this stuff down.
I tell ya, I don't see it happening.
Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.
Just go back and ask him again. (Slams the door on Kramer)
Who takes care of your boy during the day?
I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.
Well, it has nothing to do with you.
"Hey! Hey! Watch it.!... You're drooling all over the floor. How much Novocaine did that guy give you."
He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.
(reluctant) Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy.
I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody up.
Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton. **
Well I think I get the gist of it.
No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him)
What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.
He's... trying to get something off his chest.
I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)
It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.
A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in The Blob.
(standing in the bathtub) Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.
Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.
It's a cigar store Indian. (to Elaine) Read the card.
(Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah?
That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and-
I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend.
Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.
Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.
You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go 'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.'
It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a "Tada!" gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say "I'll see ya.", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)
Not that I would think of doing such things.
(To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?
(yelling) Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.
I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?
Oh the baby's fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt.
Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.
(to George) All right, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend Im disappointed. Youre going to really see me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this. Maybe you should go in the other room.
Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.
But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.
well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.
I don't know. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley..."
Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?
(advancing on Gary) ...and he told me that that... (becomes indistinct)
Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?
Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there by two o'clock. We should take a cab.
That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great! (he starts to install the table)
So you dont know whats wrong with him?
If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.
Boy, It's the way they just slip it in there too.
I know enough not to get on them.
So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!
I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.
Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.
Hold it, hold it...Look your gonna need the jaws of life to get out of those things.
Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the sirens song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?
(to Elaine) So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?
Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?
All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter)
George got him fired. He squealed on him.
Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?
Yes, so people are just dialing it by mistake and getting you.
No economic reason for them to be here.
Hey look, there's a spot right in front.
She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.
They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
I don't know, but you look like you're happy.
I never heard anybody curse in a toast.
I cant believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.
I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?
She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing to George) He likes the pop-in, too.
Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!
Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?
You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. Hmmm. What do you want?
Yeah, well, I didnt- Is that something you want to borrow?
I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?
Well, uh, I uh, I dont want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe its not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.
Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?
I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!
(Nodding, trying it out) "I'm there for you."
No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.
I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.
Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.
It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.
Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?
(grabbing the list from Kramer) You're not getting any plantains.
(dry) I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw? (really disappointed) Let's get out of here George.
The wheels are in motion, things are happening!
"Of course" was the last thing he said?
And who is on the show? Who are the characters?
It had fat in it, it's not good for you.
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?
The way I feel when I go places with you? (Kramer enters.) Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?
Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat)
(calmly getting up with plate of chicken) Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, (drops chicken into sink) was, for two.
So were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.
Well, I don't think I want to date a protg whose mentor is a Costanza.
Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.
Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly.
Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat!
No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.
and that's why you're going out with him
(Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this.
You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends....
We're gonna have to talk about this later. (Elaine holds the door open for Jerry while holding her leg) Thank you. Taxi!
He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. "I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"
Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?
Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.
Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump over the net.
Go outside and see if he's still there.
All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm away, gets phone) now... the failsafe. The wake-up guy... (dials)
I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.
So what happened? You gave her my tax papers? ... My papers?
(barring the way) I'm sorry. I-I don't know you.
(frustrated, to self) The whole system is breakin' down!
oh I'm sorry I didn't get most of that.. isn't that Kramer over there?
George used up all my guest passes already.
So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.
Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before.
I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?
I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.
But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.
I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something!
We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.
What're you doing? I thought you were changing.
(thinking to himself; picks up a tube) "Fungicide". Fungus?
Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves)
hello. Oh, hi. What's happening?  what? oh um, sure,  um, yeah, okay, uh. I'll see you then. Yeah, yeah, Bye.
Oooh! I got a pain in my side.
hey, uh.. (Kramer walks around a little) what'd you get there?
Well ... ok, I guess (voice trailing off)
Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone)
Um, you know, its the damnedest thing. It went away.
All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll meet you in front of the theatre.
What are you doing? You're choking me. Elaine!
Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, "Those aren't buoys." (Father starts laughing) Father...
Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.
So what's going on with Simon? Did he leave?
They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.
We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!
Oh I'm stressed! (makes like Kramer, outstretching his arm. Jerry heads for the freezer for some ice cream.)
Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.
What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.
You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.
Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.
Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.
(To himself) Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over there? It's not like somebody died. It's "Beaches" for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't.
I'm sorry. Got any booze? What's say you and I get ripped!
Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?
Fluff and Fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.
Best friend- Ive never been to your apartment.
Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!
Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.
Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!
Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.
(Pointing) I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.
Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours?
You know, I really... Ive come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that theyre just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you dont really wanna see them. You dont call them, they call you. You dont call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you dont really have anything in common with is to pretend youre hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend theres a little desk around you. The only problem with this is theres no way you can say, Hey, its been great having you on the show. Were out of time.
Dont do the apples. Its enough already with the apples.
Good, as a matter of fact. I almost had my own show in Japan.
How would you describe the smell in this house?
I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race.
You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.
More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.
(acting like he was walking on stage) Hey how ya doing? Good to be here.
Because you know we used to go out.
They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.
But its common sense. Hes got super strength, super speed. Im sure hes got super humor.
You raise the feet, get blood to the head.
oh I though you didn't care about his looks
She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?
A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision.
What, your sad little horsies, the house with the little curl of smoke, the sunflower with the smiley face. the transparent cube... (as she leaves)
See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.
Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.
Ah, just, you know, I don't know. Stuff, I gotta do. (grabs coat and throws it over his shoulder)
Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?
Uh, you know, why dont you go first, you just had a long trip.
You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!
Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?
I really think the M&M should be you.
What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.
The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.
Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!
No, but wait, wait And then you dump them off onto Kramer..
Yeah, theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.
Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.
No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!
Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there?
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?
Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!
Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.
Well how long you are going to keep this up?
(Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.
Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?
Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.
Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.
Well, I'm very mysterious by nature. (Jerry knocks on the door) A lot of women find that attractive.
I did. Im just curious. Its been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points? (to Vanessa) Its up six points!
Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price?
I mean, every time I see him, it's Tony this, Tony that. George is like a school girl around him
Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida.
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. (casually leaves)
He feels funny. You don't have to do this.
I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it.
So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy.
Yeah, I took her home one night  we kinda started up a little bit in the car.
Yes. Yes I am! (to Helen) What else did she say on the phone?
Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.
I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? (Kramer comes in) A real dermatologist.
You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.
Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions.
Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?
Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.
It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.
Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.
Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.
That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this?
(as Kristin is storming out) Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?
I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.
And that waist cincher, that was the topper!
Do you know what this is all about? Do you know, why were here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about We should go out? This is what theyre talking about...this whole thing, were all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, were all out! There are people tryin to find us, they dont know where we are. (on an imaginary phone) Did you ring?, I cant find him. Where did he go? He didnt tell me where he was going. He must have gone out. You wanna go out you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...Then youre standing around, whatta you do? You go We gotta be getting back. Once youre out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, its my feeling, youve gotta go.
I'll see you later. (he leaves with unseemly haste)
Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of?
I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.
I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.
(to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?
Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?
Yes I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition...
What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I dont even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. Thats what I want. I want an admission of guilt.
Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?
Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you.
Lemme just check my messages. (to himself) Maybe a nicer girl called.
What are you talking about? It's my car. Let me pay for the gas.
Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.
(into the phone, with a disguised voice) So, what's going on?
Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed like ten new minutes.
Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, (has his one hand up and his other hand down) he was down. Now he's up, (switches the positioning of his hands) you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?
It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.
Im supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?
I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin else.
Oh, see the baby again with the baby..
Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.
Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding.
Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.
All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura opens the door and gets out). What? What?
And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.
Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.
I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.
Suspected serial killer, he didn't actually do it.
I'll go if someone else drives. You going?
Theres nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.
All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?
Right. For the reducing of the pond scum?
All right, now you call it in the air.
Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please leave.
Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
(testing Joel) So, Im thinking about going to Iran this summer.
Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum.
Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.
(looking behind the counter) Hey, is that Babu? It is! (walking over) Hey, Babu!
Is there a captain's hat involved in this?
Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you do likewise.
Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't do you favors after you dump them.
Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way.
Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.
I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...
Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more.
But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.
Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. (Kramer picks up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.) Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! (Kramer starts filling a pot with water.) What are you doing with that?
Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank.
Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?
(disgusted) Ohh! You know, and sometimes shell go, (imitates Marlene) Hello, Jerry? And Ill go, Oh, hi Marlene. And then its Jerry...
(explaining) I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.
Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.
No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?
Why would I leave? This is my apartment.
All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.
Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut.
(interrupting) Can I talk to you for a second?
Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.
Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what are you doing?
Well, just give it back, and I wont say anything.
(downcast) No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
Okay, take it easy. (hangs up) That was Keith. we're going to do something next week.
I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!
"No ,Elaine and I we're just discussing whether I could admit a man is attractive."
Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.
Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father.
Well, this is it. I'm really gonna do something about my life, you know? You know, I think I'm gonna call Melanie again. So what if she shushed me. GEORGE, I am really gonna make some changes.
So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.
Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye. (Hangs up) Hey, I'm flyin' first class.
Alright, that's it.. (Grabs Kramer, trying to pull him out of the car)
Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*!
(sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand.
All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.
Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.
Then what do you call it? People dont just bump into each other and have sex. This isnt cinemax.
I always feel bad for the silver medal winner in the Olympics. How do you live with that the rest of your life? People are gonna keep asking, "- How much did you lose by? - I don't even know...! It was like...(very fast) now.now...now.now..now..was like, like... now..now..now...! It was it...! Eh, it was it and I lost. I trained, I worked out, I exercised, I did everything, I was doing push-ups, sit-ups, I never did anything but exercise and work out for 20 years, I flew half way around the world and aaaaaaaaaah!...(showing a tiny distance between his index and thumb) And that was...it was a photo-finish! Silver...(stretching his neck forward)...gold. If I had a pimple, I would've won.
You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola!
I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table.
Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,
Go ahead shake his hand. You're Jerry Seinfeld. You've been on the Tonight Show.
All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.
He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?
Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.
Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination? You couldn't possibly visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life size snotty puppet. I guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. That's the end of the line for a mannequin. "What ever happened to Bob?" "Have you seen that new Volvo commercial? He's got a bulls eye right in his face." Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, I guess these are the two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves. Well dressed or getting killed. I'm sure there is some pro-mannequin organization that doesn't even like you to use the term mannequin. "Hey they're not mannequins, they're the life deprived."
Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?
Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?
Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)
They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
Look, youre a nice guy, its just that... we dont have anything in common.
All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.
Aah! .. right. The ones from Oregon that are only ripe for two weeks a year..
(Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?
I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister...
Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?
Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail.
I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.
(on phone) But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.
They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!
So you go in the bathroom at eleven your in bed by what, two?
Hey what about Dr. Resnick My Uncle Leo is going to see him tomorrow .
You got it ALL wrong. I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoans
I don't know if they have land guys.
And she was beautiful in that bra! I'm crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging, free wheeling attitude!
Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.
Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.
I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.
Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.
I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...
(to Kramer) Hey (snaps fingers) get your stuff, let's get going.
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal, (steer).
So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?
(TO GEORGE) Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?
(Takes the ticket back and looks at it, flips it over) The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too.
(smiling) Really? That's great. You said that to him?
Well , as I said this type of thing is very common in show business
There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing *just* a bra. I can't get that image out of my mind.
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.
Well, at least have some reaction to it.
Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He couldn't! (listens) Alright, I will. (listens) Okay, bye.
I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.
You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.
Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio.
She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.
Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...yknow, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, its dark, theres bubbles happening, theyre all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, Cmon babe, lets go. You come by, you open up the lid and theyll- (stiffens up, as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, theyre in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, Tomorrow, the dryer, Im goin. You wait here! The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you dont see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So theyre showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isnt your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first.
Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?
Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please.
To wash my hands. Theyre sticky from the orange.
(Reading words George wrote on his hand) "Matthew, Luke, Paul", what youre cheating on your conversion chest?
(To George) You're off bread. (To Elaine) So what happened is it over?
Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're puttin' it in my box now.
Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.
Where are you going, you just got here?
Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?
Yeah thats a good deal -- you win the Pennant with that trade, hair for phlegm.
Were taking Elaine to dinner. Shes got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?
I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!
Well don't get too comfortable. As soon as Seth gets a real job you two are gong back in that chicken supernova.
Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it.
Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything.
(to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.
Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.
Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. Shes usually pretty punctual. Dont you find that, George?
But then anyone can just look in and see you.
Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.
(Surprised to see her, he gets up) Where's George?
Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.)
Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.
I can't go to sleep at nine o clock!
What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.
Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.
The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go "Excuse me, I think you missed a spot."
He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal.
Happy camper , I don't hear that expression enough.
The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be?
I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.
You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.
I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.
No, its not you. Its your stomach, hes taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
You're not qualified to work at the catalog.
O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!
You can't put a paper towel on his head.
I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no.
He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket books. Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.
No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.
Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here.
Hi. Ah look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna.
I got one problem. Youre keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that shes coming.
What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't respect salad eaters.
Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something.
If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!
If my father was moving this hed had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (as his father) 'Have you got your end?...Your ends got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your ends got to come down.'
Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.
Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?
It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.
Who figures and immigrants gonna have a pony?
(on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel! (hangs up the phone very disappointed)
Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.
What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.
Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?
Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.
Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.
Hello, oh hi Duncan, 400 o'clock tomorrow? That is not going to work. . . . Why? I'll tell you why. Because I chose not to run!
You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.
First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.
I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.
What, you got a problem with the pen now?
Why, what's wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders)
(in a hurry) Yea you're leaving at three o'clock.
(with a wild expression) Hey, Kramer! I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open!
I like that thing in your hair there.
(picking up his bag and coat) Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?
I don't have it. You want half my omelet? (holds his omelet plate up to Bania)
I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
(still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.
What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?
(on the phone) Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye. (hangs up the phone)
Hey. It's you! (pointing) Th..that's my Friars Club jacket!
Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?
(To himself) Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. (George doesn't react) What's the matter?
Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph?
Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.
Let me see that. (Jerry looks at the tag.) That is high.
Alright, alright. Uh, undo them. I'll help you get them off.
It's alright, I want you to have it.
You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it.
Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!
(indicates with his thumb) Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.
Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?
"I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite."
Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet?
You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?
Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...
(Pointing out) It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for "Avast ye matey" - what the hell does that mean?! "20 degrees off the starboard side - the Spanish Galleon!" - there's no comeback for that!
...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.
Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?
No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial.
Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to give it up.
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.
(Nodding) I think you may have something there.
You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.'
I dont know. He said hed call back.
Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?
Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in big, big trouble.
(also wearing a moustache) What do you mean, 'what is it?' It's a country right next to Belgium.
I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.
So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm gonna try to sell the van to a lot.
You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.
All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom cab.
And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.
I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!
No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.
Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test.
So you lie! What did you tell her?
Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?
Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.
All right, I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else.
All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a specimen.
No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!
Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!
(trying to defuse the situation) Look, no-one is lifting anything.
Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out...
Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.
(Pulls the note out of his pocket) That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.
(into phone) Hello Joe, listen this is Jerry Seinfeld, I really think there?s been a huge colossal misunderstanding,
(worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!
Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction.
(also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it.
Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?
So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.
No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy.
Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.
Sure, its like robbing a bank. You dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.
No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me. She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised what's going on.
I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)
You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.
He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught.
I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.
Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. It'll crush him.
Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those orange cones you have on the throughway... (Sees pilot) on the way... up here... um... I..
No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!
The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off?
No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.
He's got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, Jerry notices one of the movie goers) Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?
(naked, carrying a belt sander) I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.
Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.
No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.
Well, thats it. You two are back together.
First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, "Didn't you see my signal?" "Look at that fender!" ..Then you'd see a real fight.
Oh, see that's not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people.
(Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining room doorway) I think the busboy's in trouble.
Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?
It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.
Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.
Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.
Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.
You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!
Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.
Soon as I get off the phone wih you.
Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?
Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.
Aaa. Well ... you want something to eat, don't you?
Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.
Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery.
But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.
hunky.. Tony.. hey hey hey (fools around with his collar again)
Wow, look at you. So you got the job.
Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.
It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.
(dialing) He got em out of the house.
We didnt bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.
Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.
Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.
Ah. But they told us we must go now.
(to waiter) Ill have a cranberry juice with two limes.
I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back.
Did you say, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show" or, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"? (Elaine comes over.)
Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat...
Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want? You're not a part of society.
Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?
Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you.
I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.
Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.
(to George) You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! It's crazy Joe Devola.
So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?
Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---
Gina, do you know what a Drakes Coffee Cake is?
Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.
(mind's voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?
Yeah! I got it . It's in the apartment, but we can't go in there it's being fumigated.
Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.
A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.
Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.
Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.
(extemporising) That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go.
You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.
Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.
Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago.
Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?
Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?
Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off.
George- What?! Youre kidding... Well, whats wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, Ill speak to you later. (He hangs up.) Wilkinson, the guy whos supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, hes in the hospital.
Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.
Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's better than eating it.
I sure do miss my apartment. Maybe I'll switch back.
Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)
I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.
Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened. (listens) Well, I think you should. Okay, bye.
There you go. That'll get you home in time.
How am I going to live with myself?!
Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.
(animated) You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about.
A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?
(on the phone) Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.
When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.
Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing and
I dont bother with him. Hes been calling me for seven years. Ive never called him once! Hes got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if hes paying attention.
Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.
I mean it's no big deal. You're still drivin'. You should have been watching the road.
Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist.
I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.
A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!
Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'
Actually, I did. I put it on last night and slept in it.
Cause Im an idiot! You may think youre an idiot, but with all due respect, Im a much bigger idiot than you are.
The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.
Well put something down, youre taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac and Artie, theyre all coming over here before the wedding?
(Reading from his notebook) I got You enter, you go "Hi", and I go, "Hello." Now.. we need something here..
(Thinking) What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship. Gotta relax.
Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.
Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay... is uh...
You had a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with my butler?
(a la "Don Corleone") Never go against the family, Elaine.
Ma! Ma! MAAA! (Hangs up the phone in disgust.) Oh, ahhhh (sighs quietly)
There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?
After one date you try and improvise on her machine?
I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the "It's me" on the phone today.
Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!
Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.
I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.
How about our little Elaine huh? Attended the finest finishing schools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions. Debutante balls. Look at her now. Interviewing Mohels.
This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!
So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table
Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!
Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!
You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?
Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?
You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
See you later. (to Elaine) Well we cant all be dating podiatrists. (Elaine laughs)
You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!
Yeah, I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her.
(To George) You're givin' him back that TV.
You know I don't even know why I brought you.
That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.
I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.
You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.
There he is. He's going into that bar.
I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone.
Yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder)
(unenthusiastic) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) Im just, Im really glad youre here.
Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you.
It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...
No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?
Oh, were meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building.
Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.
So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out (as mortician) 'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'. (as Mrs Costanza, horrified) Aahh!
No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.
There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.
Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, "That's not a bad idea."
No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.
No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)
Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure there are many people who do not like me.
You're meetin' the father for the first time?
Oh! man did you see that. I ate discarded food.
You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.
Aww, right. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it!
oh you think she's Erika, the phone sex woman
No, I think I would have remembered Memma.
Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.
She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was "Beaches" for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?
Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!
The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.
Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.
Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.
Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.
I don't know , Who keeps track of Hellos.
I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it.
Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.
Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!
(through gritted teeth) Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.
It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, "This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here."
(turning to each other) I dont know. Hes an importer.
People are going to steal from you. You cant stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker, whos gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They cant get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.
You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand?
Alright! (picks up the phone and dials) Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. You know, you got a great 'John Houseman' name. Alec Berg. Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg?
Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police! Some guy just gave me a wise answer. Ask that woman.
No, go ahead. Look at this place. I cant wait to get it cleaned.
You unwittingly made a major commitment. That's a lot of pressure.
I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.
Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?
(pointing to Kramer's hair) You got some suds over here.
Oh, no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down. (George & Jerry each slide to the end of their booth seats)
You should always carry a pad and pen.
Are you nuts? You dont even know the guy.
There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her
Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid...
Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
You can't go to China What about your job?
Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.
Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.
Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!
(Arms out, complaining) I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!
I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.
(walking towards door with Elaine) How long did you last? (opens door)
Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.
So youre sure youre not still angry about last night?
(turning to Kramer) That's nice for the freaks.
Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.
Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.
Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.
I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem.
Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?
No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?
Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Caf Latte?
I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.
Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!
Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen.
(a little confused) You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables?
(Hands him some mail) There you go. Merry Chirstmas!
They did it for three years. What's another few months.
Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm alarge.
(getting worked up) I don't need the money.
We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)
Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.
Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.
Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.
(as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people.
Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?
All right! I'll do it. The race is on.
Thats what you want to see, yeah. . . . Yeah, you want to trade your hair for some phlegm.
Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.
I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.
The one Puddy screamed at in the car?
Im worried I wont be able to talk to him. Hes such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.
Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.
She likes him I mean she really likes him.
Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.
Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.
Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?
(hitting metal with the first strike of the shovel) Well, that was easy.
Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? There's no grace period.
I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.
I don't even know what you're talking about.
So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?
Do you want me to break up with you?
I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.
(sarcasm) Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.
Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.
Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)
(pause) I thought you said... "ridicurous." (Donna looks puzzled)
Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.
Good luck, It's sold out for the next three weeks.
Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her Im sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.
I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.
Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch?
Yeah, hes nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper up to Jerry.) I know, I know. Its down again.
Youre movin in, youre a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars. (Elaine is shocked, Jerry opens the door to the hall.) Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I dont even wanna see it, go, get it out.
Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.
You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!
All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! (Audience boos)
No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time?
Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
Ate? What? What the hell are you talking about? Now you listen to me, you get out of that apartment this instant. If you screw this up for me I swear....
Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?
You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.
Hey, wait a second. You know, we could share a cab. They're playing at the same Cineplex.
have some more, take some for the road.
Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?
What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.
Yeah, its some place down in the village.
Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did!
I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.
But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.
Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? Theres Elastic Man... Plastic Man...
All right. Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot. (hangs up)(to George) Casting tomorrow at NBC. 400. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful. (George looks disappointed)
I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high.
George, we're trying to have a civilization here.
I was hoping you'd offer. (The intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time.
Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, you were right. I'll do anything!
I'm not paying for anything until I get that back.
Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship.
(throws out his hands) What does he listen to? The all Desperado station?
So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you.
Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.
How many years of med school did you have?
I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I dont get this. Arent cows outside most of the time? I dont understand it. When its raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, Let us in, were all wearin leather. Open the door! Were gonna ruin the whole outfit here! Is it suede? I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I cant have this cleaned. Its all I got!
No no no, dont interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what its doing. Just let it finish.
Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.
Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting a package.
You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.
(touching the back of his neck) It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.
Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.
Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.
How's life on the red planet? (shuts door)
So then as I was getting out of the car, ...
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.
You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldnt expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.
Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?
The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke. (The phone rings.) Thats probably Uncle Leo.
(To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up)
Sure. See, things always even out for me.
Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly.
Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.
Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you (throws the bottle to Kramer.)
Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.
So, uh, whats your son doing now, Dr. Stevens? Oh, hes a public fornicator. Yes, hes a fine boy...
Oh why don't you go sleep over at Newman's.
Plus Im wearing short sleeves, I dont want to expose my tattoos. (Vanessa smiles; thinking) Shes unbelievable!
It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
What should I do, should I call the police?
Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.
Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the check to Elaine) look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.
Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be? (Elaine laughs - hu) Why can't you live?
I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide.
I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood.
Well maybe he's got like a, cheerful mental hold on you.
So when somebody has B.O., the "O" usually stays with the "B". Once the "B" leaves, the "O" goes with it.
You were livin' in the village then, right?
(Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.
You're not going to open with that, are you?
Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...(hugs Meryl.) I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!
Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler.
I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.
Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.
