Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.
I'll call back, thank you. (hangs up the phone) He went to South America!
Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.
Cause Im an idiot! You may think youre an idiot, but with all due respect, Im a much bigger idiot than you are.
Lemme see if I understand this. In other words, you held out
I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going "I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?
(under breath) Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..
Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?
You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples clothes
So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.
What do you mean? Why wouldn't I know his name?
This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.
Yeah, I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her.
No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)
And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?
George, we're trying to have a civilization here.
It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go. (to old man that enters) It was GEORGE!
A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?
Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?
Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer, sitting on his lawn chair with a sparkler)
He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?
Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.
I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out.
Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is.
Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestl's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--
(Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together?
They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?
No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.
I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.
Hey, have fun at the... family reunion. (George exits) So, what do you know about this Jack fellow?
Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?
I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!
and that's why you're going out with him
So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.
Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?
I don't understand why we have to eat now.
(to Kramer) Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night. (frustrated) Where the hell is that jacket?
All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.
Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy.
(still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.
Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department.
And she was beautiful in that bra! I'm crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging, free wheeling attitude!
You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...
Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Jerry hugs Kramer, then grabs him by the cheeks.) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think Im in the clear here. Elaines not moving in. I dont have to confront her. She has no idea I never wanted her to move in. Im golden!
Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Uh, gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. Alright let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... (looks at Joe; Joe gives him a weird look)ooo, just right... and three plantains uh ought to do it.
Yeah, uh, Ok, uh, tomorrow uh, where da ya - where do you live, uh, up town? Upper west side?
What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods.) Did he tell you whats gonna happen? (George shakes his head.) How long were you there?
Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.
Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?
Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!
You know what? I'll be with you in a minute.
You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back.
Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.
Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made.
Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?
Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I dont get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, Im not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, theyre so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, thats it! Its the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we dont know bout that, we dont know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas weve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! I dont think she likes me. The amazing thing is, that we still get women, dont we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. Thats why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like Where to meet men? Were here, we are everywhere. Were honking our horns to serve you better.
If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.
He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.
Oh, yes. Particularly if youre not in it.
Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.
All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you double what you paid for it.
Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful.
Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore...
All right, all right, I?ll wear this. It's bad enough I?ve got to go to the opera I?ve got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here.
Oh! man did you see that. I ate discarded food.
Look, I gotta try and help the guy.
I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?
Hey. How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?
Of course, I stink, you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks..
Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?
Hey, could you do me a favour? [pause] Could you shut-up?
You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.
Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, "That's not a bad idea."
Are you nuts? You dont even know the guy.
No, hes It. He wins. It is good.
(hangs up the phone) Yeah, I really needed that suit.
She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.
So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!
Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!
You were saying Stan? I-I'm sorry about that.
Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me (flustered, he indicates a nose pick)
I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes when someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within the gay community. They're probably discriminated against because of that, people say to them "Y'know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but I think think it's about time, y'know that you got in shape, tucked the shirt in and lost the wife". But if people are even going to assume that people that are neat are gay, maybe instead of doin' this, "Y'know I think Joe might be a little... [waves hand back and forth]", they should vacuum "Y'know I think Joe might be >vroom< [makes vacuuming motion]. Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little >vrooom<..."
Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.
Oh no. Thats impossible. Id rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.
Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!
So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?
But that is not what they would have you believe.
Really? (They start to make out, Jerry sees the pilot on the plane) Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!
No, you stay here in the car. I may need you.
Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?
(Opens the door) C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? (Starts jiggling his keys - as if he's calling out for a dog) Huh? C'mon! C'mon!
My stomach, I , think it was that cookie.
Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?
I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.
(turning on the commercial) Right, quiet dignity. As opposed to, say, this?
The Improv is playing "Rochelle Rochelle" The musical.
Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me?
Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.
Oh, shes really great. I mean, shes got like a real warmth about her and shes really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better.
You had how many dates with him? Three?
(proud of himself) Remember me? I said I 'd come back with someone and I did. Surprised?.
It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.
So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.
"I don't think so. I think they were getting dressed and not only that; my shirt was out!!!"
(Making nothing of it) So? Who cares about that?
We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.
(getting looks from his parents) Not you. Older people.
The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.
Youre movin in, youre a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars. (Elaine is shocked, Jerry opens the door to the hall.) Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I dont even wanna see it, go, get it out.
. Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it
This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.
...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.
Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?
Doesnt matter. Whats the young mans name? I would like to meet him.
Im Jerry, Elaines friend, and this is George.
She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.
Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.
Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.
He went back? What do you mean he went back?
Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched voice) Gone.
George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.
What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?
(to Morty) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street!
What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?
I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.
Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test.
Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!
Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.
You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.
Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys.
(quiet) Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..
Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!
Hey, guess what. I just bought my father a Cadillac
Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again.
Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?
Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.
Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles.
Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?
Yeah.. When he's dead he'll be relieved... Oh by the way Viking Press sent a Fedex for you to my parents. They brought it with 'em.
(Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.
Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.
The crook has the machine. The messages arent for him. Hes the crook. Why would he answer- (Jerry gives up on the explanation and turns around to see George standing behind him.) How did you get in here?
Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.
Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?
Great, its yours. I can't stand the sight of it. Elaine, heres the car keys. (tosses her the keys)
(outraged) He's a doctor!.I mean it's supposed to be like a sterile environment."
You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown?
(Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.
...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code.
I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
(to the phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)
What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him, I dont think were right for each other. Hes a guy! At least with a woman, theres a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.
Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office
Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. (Rachel shocked)
What do you need a job, you got Audrey.
(Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal.
(Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled "Ori-dent") Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!
I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.
(answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.
All right Ramon, Im going to get going.
Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)
Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*!
No, I think I would have remembered Memma.
I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.
No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it. (throws watch in garbage)
Hello. Didn't I see you at the pro shop yesterday?
I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.
I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!
(reluctant) Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy.
What do you mean you're in the same class?
Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?
Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?
Ill call Kramer. He can check my house.
I don't believe this. (They run into theater)
I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now.
Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here.
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!
Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!
Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.
Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?
Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?
I never shouldve gotten involved in this. Im a nervous wreck. Im not cut out for investing.
Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!
What do you think the worst part of being blind is?
(Threatening tone) So, listen, Puddy. When we first started this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you want to play hard ball, I got my friend, George, here, and he can play pretty hard ball. (Leaving the negotiation to George) George, vein it up.
Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...
(pointing at Georges shirt) See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. Its too high! Its in no-mans-land. You look like you live with your mother.
Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?
I dont get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?
(Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?
You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story??
Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.
We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked.
(To Assistant) I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?
You're not qualified to work at the catalog.
You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.
Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!
It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.
Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.
Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid...
(to George) Did you call me a wuss?
OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you know you are always welcome in my home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story.
I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I dont know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because its really not a definite thing yet. (crowd cheers him on to tell them) Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that Ive received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. (audience applauds) Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didnt even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, thats what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, You may have already won. Id like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, You have definitely lost! You turn it over, giant printing, Not even close! You open it up, theres this whole letter of explanation, Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest.
I dont know, I don't feel so good.
Well, well, why are you getting rid of your refrigerator? (he gets up from the table and carries a dish into the kitchen)
Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one.
No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?
And who is on the show? Who are the characters?
Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. "Oo that little tail really turns me on."
Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.
You never really had the right comeback, anyway.
I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!
Alright, then just get rid of it. You wont have any problem.
(Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.
(thinking) So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?
You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe its Manage A Trois.
She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
Go outside and see if he's still there.
(As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George.
Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of deadbeats.
I think what he's trying to say is, "get the bouilla-base." (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)
OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers?
So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out (as mortician) 'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'. (as Mrs Costanza, horrified) Aahh!
(Nodding, trying it out) "I'm there for you."
This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?
Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal right now. (covers Jean-Paul with a blanket)
Especially when you got a layover in Sarajevo. (Bosnia Herzegovina)
Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket.
All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.
Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there by two o'clock. We should take a cab.
You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.
Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.
I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.
So it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato.
First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.
The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.
(Reading words George wrote on his hand) "Matthew, Luke, Paul", what youre cheating on your conversion chest?
So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
I don't know, this? (Shows his neck to Sara.)
Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.
"The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour". I'm confused.
so the woman was walking around in a bra
(emphatic) I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!
They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.
(To bartender) Can I have a club soda? (To Ronnie) Goin' on tonight?
Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours.
Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself.
I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?
You think they have fleas there, don't you?
Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh, Ketchup? Pretty name for a girl.
Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet?
I don't know. What if I get caught?
I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg." But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, "Would you mind?!"
I said, "How come no one's killed her?" Probably shouldn't have said anything,
I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club...
So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.
(Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off George, and puts it back on his bed)
(out of window) George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!
It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse "ha's." You know those?
Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
Either that, or theyve got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why dont you just go to the cashier?
You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while, no matter how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because they're crawling , crawling on your skin. Up your legs , up your spine , up your back.....
Am I going? It was three nights ago.
Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's got this strangest habit. She eats her peas one at a time. You've never seen anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. I mean, we've had dinner other times. I've seen her eat Corn Niblets. But she scooped them.
Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.
I feel terrible. (Kramer smiling) I mean, Ive seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I cant go any further, but... Shes just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I cant breathe. Its like a drug.
I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.
Oh my God is that the new perfume?
(is redialing) I should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.
Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred!
Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.
Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!
...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.
What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage death match.
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!
I don't have your suit. I gave it away.
What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it.
Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!
Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo.
No I wasn't there. (enters and slams the door)
Where do you suppose that could've come from?
Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log.
(startled - eyes wide open) Hello, is somebody there? (scurrying sound) Mr.- Mr. Marbles?
Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. You had to give him a box of cigars.
I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.
Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me?
Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?
Did you say, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show" or, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"? (Elaine comes over.)
I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.
(Being frank) Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.
Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?
Well how long you are going to keep this up?
(To his parents) So? What do you think?
Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
(wistful) I don't know, I just see you guys together.
(Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
. . . All right (gritting teeth) Just give me the ticket.
I thought you were going out with Celia?
I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.
(Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So we're on for later?
That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?
Well, the mans an individualist  he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what hes doing.
Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.
She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults. Things you would know very little about.
No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture.
Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers?
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?
(on the phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second. (George walks in  Jerry asks George) So we definitely dont want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes his head NO) Alright, were back together again, great. Bye bye.
No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.
To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go "Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch." According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.
What should I do? (to Alton) Uh, were taking a cab, arent we?
Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.
No, see, we didnt have ponies. Im sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..
Why would he steal a box of raisins?
Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!
(Fast) Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me!
Oh my god, he knows. (Jerry and Gino scrambling) Go. (yelling to the door) One second.
Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!
Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!
(Trying to block out Kramer, he starts to sing along with the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus..
I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.
Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.
Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.
You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.
By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!
So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?
Hey look ,you know, you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here. You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me.
Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! Its a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!
Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.
That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?
(holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.
You can't put a paper towel on his head.
Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car so I don't toss it in that dumpster?
No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?
Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those orange cones you have on the throughway... (Sees pilot) on the way... up here... um... I..
What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!
Its great! It speeds up the intimacy level. Its like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish (snaps his fingers) three days.
(aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?
(trying to shut the trunk hood) Something wrong with this trunk.
Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.
Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. (They both walk to the booth and sit down. Suddenly, Gwen is attractive) Now this is a good looking booth.
I don't even know what you're talking about.
I know, I just can't bring myself to do it meanwhile that freezer keeps getting smaller and smaller (she smiles) (Elaine looks at her watch) oh, don't wanna keep Tony waiting
Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (Jerry smiles. George laughs.) So, how's the book coming? (George's laughs taper off...) I say, how's the book comin'?
You want food, don't cha? (nodding his head up and down)
They sell them by the side of the road. Blueberry, Blackberry ....
Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.
Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.
It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.
So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner?
So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?
Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! (Kramer enters.)
Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.
Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal.
Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?
Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? To me tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. "That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh."
Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?
All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.
(Stunned) No, keep it. (Elaine enters the apartment) Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.
Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino.
Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?
Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.
I was ready to get jiggy with it.
Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters)
She thinks youre a guy that doesnt like coffee.
They did it for three years. What's another few months.
I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers...
That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.
Hey, lll just keep swimming. Hey, hey. Im not done. I know what you're up to Ramon. Because Im a member here, this is my place to swim.
I guess they leave that up to the general population.
Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket.
Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
So what does he care if you put lifts in?
Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!
All right, just give me a western. (unhappy)
Toilet brush, oh (he pulls a 'Damn, shoulda guessed!' face). Alright, I can replace that.
(Thinking) What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship. Gotta relax.
You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!
First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, "Didn't you see my signal?" "Look at that fender!" ..Then you'd see a real fight.
You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.
I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses!
Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen "Girlie" Brown would be very proud of you.
'51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?
Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.
I will, I just walked in the door.
That's the way they do it in Vegas.
We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
"Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!"
You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.
See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think?
What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers.
(on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV for another minute) The letter, that's the letter!
Hey, I called you last night, where were you?
All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll meet you in front of the theatre.
All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?
Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.
Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days!
You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?
You know I don't even know why I brought you.
NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye.
Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.
Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.
Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.
Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh
Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may depend on it.
I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
Oh, I know her. I know her type.
Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery.
And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.
That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen -
You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...
Aah, top of the fridge. Hey George, I'm taking that waitress to the Tony's.
The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.
I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.
(grabbing the list from Kramer) You're not getting any plantains.
Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! (Kramer gestures sympathetically) And who buries a bird?
Ill call him. (Jerry picks up the cordless phone. He points to the rotary phone on the coffee table. Kramer, George, and Elaine struggle for it.) Hello, Ray?... Hi, Ray, this is Ravas friend, Elaines friend, Jerry... The King of Comedy, right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? (He covers the reciever and yells at Kramer and George.) Would you shut up?! (to the phone) Yeah, you dont want to talk about it over the phone?.. You dont want Rava to hear?... Yeah, I understand... You know that coffee shop near my house, Monks?... All right, tomorrow... One o clock... Great, okay, bye.
(fidgets like he has no room with George next to him)... Could you move over there?!
Keep following him Kramer. don't let me down.
(Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.
May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" across the painting)
Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya doing?
Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.
So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.
Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.
Oh! There coming to town tomorrow by the way.
I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!
(finishing) The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.
If I see her, what do I say that Im doing here in the building?
He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.
Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?
No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?
Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...
Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.
Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man.
Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. Weve been doing this silly, dumb voice.
I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back.
Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.
But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.
See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup...
Come on up . (looks at his watch) ...What's he doing here now?
Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.
I thought you just said she doesn't know??
You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.
Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up?
Why didn't you come up with your own?
No, no. It-It's really funny. There's these two guys-
Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.
So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head.
I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway.
I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.
I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.
You know, Kramer's gonna clean up on this place.
That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.
Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to Elaine)
So tonight are you going to make the move?
I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.
I don't know what you should do with it.
First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?
Ahh, too bad you got a little, George Costanza thing going on.
Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.
Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here!
It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.
He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.
You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!
Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit.
Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.)
They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same.
Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? There's no grace period.
Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on.
I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton.
So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else in real estate?
I've been waiting a while for this. You know it's a shame Tony got all banged up, we're not gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
You told Testikov, (Elaine nods) that Tolstoy wanted to name his book "War-- What Is IT Good For?"?
The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?
Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.
Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without.
Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. (Newman considers the implications of this.)
Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?
(Gesturing to Ellen) Kramer, George, this is Ellen.
Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.
Why didn't you just ask her for it?
Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.
In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.
You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about the Costanzas'
So forget about the books. Did you read them?
No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.
You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.
It was just an innocent comment! I didnt know she had a pony!
Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.
Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck.
What are we doing out here? Aren't we going to go in and eat?
Wait a minute! (A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.)
Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He couldn't! (listens) Alright, I will. (listens) Okay, bye.
So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?
Oh! Come om . He'll be over there for a half hour, he gets lost over there. C'mon so what is this about?
I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.
Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.
No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.
(fetching a drink from the fridge) Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.
Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton. **
The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.
Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.
Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die.
Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves, wanted to come home and start working on his floor.
Sex, thats meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; thats heavy. Thats like an hour.
Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're puttin' it in my box now.
Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits on a couch.) Hey, what about this one?
Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business thing...
The old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go "how do you like crotch?" If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly.
Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.
Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it is. (vehement) Just take it!
What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?
I don't know how long this is gonna last.
Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.
Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.
Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.
Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?
Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.
Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention, Elaine laughs) Maybe it's time you got a different hobby.
Oh. yeah. Alright. (pushes Kramer and Elaine out the door, then sits next to Sidra on the couch.) So, where were we?
I was going to say, "Being a good host."
I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)
There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?
Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?
So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?
You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.
Look, you can hang out here if you want.
(Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything?
It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.
Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia, watching Jerry on TV. Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.
I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!
Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.
I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.
Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.
I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?
Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!
All right, so I had wooden teeth, so what?
Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.
Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.
I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.
I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.
Did you see the look on that guy's face?
(Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) It'll be on your conscience.
You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.
(re the underwear pile) Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.
Yeahhh, am I imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and holds it up to Willie) Found this little cutie in the pocket. (throws the stub on the counter)
Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.
So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!
Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.
I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! **
(To Guard) I just wanted you to scare him.
Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?
See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.
Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?
So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.
Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?
So you don't cry when your grandmother dies? But a hotdog makes you lose control?
....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together.
So you lie! What did you tell her?
Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.
I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket)
Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up.
Because she's my wife! (The door buzzer sounds; Jerry answers it) Yeh?
So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist. You just called the woman for a date.
I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing.
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.
A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?
In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.
(impatiently cutting in) Hey Elaine What about the crest.? What d'you think of the crest here.
(Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.
Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...
I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.
(Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.
Yeah. (pointing at Elaine as he goes into the bedroom)
Well, I got to talk her out of this.
Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something.
Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.)
On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?
So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?
(thinks) Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize?
Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.
(cutting in) I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman.
Just get the key and let's get out of here.
I'm laying down! Then we'll see how he does up there, without all the assistance.
So what's going on with Simon? Did he leave?
That's enough. (They leave. George comes around the corner.)
(into phone) Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. (to George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!
O.k., good, I'll see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.)
So lemme get this straight you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an clair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, "What the hell, I'll just eat some trash."
I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.
(smiling with pleasure) You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile.
(talking to Beth on the phone) Could you put him on, I'd love to say hello.
You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!
So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you this thing was good!
(taking the envelope) Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em.
So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.
Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.
No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey)
I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.
Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.
Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again)
I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.
Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?
He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris.
Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!
No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.
Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.
Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, "Oh. Tube socks." What are you gonna do about it?
No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch)
I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.
So ah, what did you do last night?
Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.
Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
Ah, actually, I ka, kinda had some things to do.
All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little.
You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.
I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table.
I couldnt tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that
Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!
Hey, I got a real thing about "shushing"!
(disgusted) Ohh! You know, and sometimes shell go, (imitates Marlene) Hello, Jerry? And Ill go, Oh, hi Marlene. And then its Jerry...
I don't mind at all. Why should I mind? What did he say?
Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?
So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.
I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.
I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So(throws away belt) thats it!
He can't just throw me off the plane!
No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I wouldve said tonight.
Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!
And I don't want you to hold mine!
So what? A lot of older men have that.
You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.
She went out to get her head shaved.
I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a, its a little crumpled.
(walking over the the buzzer to answer it) Oh, that's the Flicks.
Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?
(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
(Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?
So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--
Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?
No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o.
So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City. I'm performing at Bally's.
What about this? This is blood isn't it?!
Oh. (notices a car being jacked up by a tow truck) Hey, isn't this Kramer's car? (yelling up) Hey, Cosmo!! They're towing your car!!
I *just* learned that. (proudly holding the Yo-Yo)
Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.
What are you doing? Were going out to dinner in ten minutes.
That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.
We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!
Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school.
(long pause -- did he hear "ridicurous" -- should he say something -- can't decide if he should. Finally...) Did you say, "ridicurous"?
(reading on) "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-"
Newman . Open the door, Newman, I know you're in there.
I mean, every time I see him, it's Tony this, Tony that. George is like a school girl around him
(to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello.
Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.
(on the phone) Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye. (hangs up the phone)
402? (Checks his wristwatch) Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup!
No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.
(noticing a coffee table book) Oh, you got the Civil War book. I saw some of that show, it was wonderful.
Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.
No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex.
Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!
You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal(sp?) before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.
Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...(hugs Meryl.) I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!
Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.
(to Kramer) So how's your karate class going?
So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!
Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee.
No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him.
What is it she think you can't do?
It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ...
(Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 'French Impressionist Paintings'?
The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.
Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?
Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?
I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?
No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.
What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't respect salad eaters.
Hello is this Alicia? .This is Jerry Seinfeld.
Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)
I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight....
Yeah. (subdued) I don't think this is the jacket.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.
Someone says, Get out of my life, and that doesnt affect your appetite?
She wanted to thank us for the apartment.
They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.
So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.
Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.
Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!
Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.
Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.
Well, I am sure I had a good reason.
Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?
Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?
Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
(pause) I don't know, they just tell you the night before.
You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.
Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please.
Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.
Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye. (hangs up the phone; turns to Kramer) You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.
Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before.
Theres nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.
And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.
Go ahead shake his hand. You're Jerry Seinfeld. You've been on the Tonight Show.
Yes you do. That's what you both think.
Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit?
Ya what was this? (HE IMITATES MOHEL'S FLINCHING)
Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?
(turning to Elaine; thinking) Oh no, not now.
Donna, really, youre making too much of this.
But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.
Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other?
That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. (goes knocking on Kramer's)
Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.
Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their face, you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going with somebody.
Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.
Right in front of me!. How do you know we're not together. Two guys, sittin' laughin' drinking Champagne Coolies.
Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere... I got my bags, I'm ready to go.
What should I do, should I call the police?
I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.
All right, that's enough of that. (Jerry takes the plates and hands them to a waitress.)
Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?
But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.
You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.
They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.
I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.
Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a little. .
But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.
You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?
So she tought I did it to get back at her
Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)
(cont) and this whole justice league, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman. You mean to tell me Superman can't cover everything?
You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars.
You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?
I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.
Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.
Y-You didnt do anything. Its not you, its me. Its- this is very difficult.
Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?
Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg.
Didn't you see the sign on the door?
Well we're sitting here together. Why wouldn't you think that.
Yeah!.. Thanks.Oh! my god you saved my life.
You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me.
Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going "Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going."
Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.
I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers.
Yes. (To Jenny) You're sure there's nothing we can do?
You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.
(grunting as he throws bread into the air)
A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in The Blob.
I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.
So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.
No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!
Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude.
How are we gonna get out of it?
All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a mnage  trois with her and her roommate.
Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit) And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.
(advancing on Gary) ...and he told me that that... (becomes indistinct)
She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love!
See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.
Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?
And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.
My car? You drove it into the swamp!
I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?
I would know if I had a blender.
Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.
And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?
No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?
Oh, see that's not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people.
(To himself) Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over there? It's not like somebody died. It's "Beaches" for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't.
You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?
Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didnt like the looks of the defense and changed the play.
Got lost? We went to school here for three years.
Already? That was fast... I assume he's not a High Talker...
Why would I freak out? (To himself) Pilot...
Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!
I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.
Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?
No more crutches, that must be a relief.
(Pointing) He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..
Why, you don't think it's a good job?
Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--
I'll see you tonight. (he's opening his door apartment as Kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe)
When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!
Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you do likewise.
(to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? (wondering what the hell's Kramer doing)
Ah, you know. Im supposed to meet, eh, someone -- Ill, Ill wait for them outside. (walks towards the door)
I live in New York. (slams the cab door) What the hell happened?
So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?
Hey, do you know what the Whip does?
There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.
I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.
"I don't know but I was spitting out and rinsing like there was no tomorrow."
(George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party?
(Over the phone) Elaine, youve got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin me on this car, which is yellow now!
No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
So when somebody has B.O., the "O" usually stays with the "B". Once the "B" leaves, the "O" goes with it.
No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?
Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go?
Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.
So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.
Soon as I get off the phone wih you.
What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?
I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the "It's me" on the phone today.
What, What is this? What is she doing here?
Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?
Oh, like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping carts with one bad wheel?
Well , as I said this type of thing is very common in show business
(turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isn't that your charter group?
Yes it is. I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior.
So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. Its a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and Im supposed to feel bad. Is that the way its supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldnt you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. Cause its not easy to give someone the toe, youve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... (Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) Look at that toe, buddy. (He puts his foot down.) I mean, thats really insulting to get the toe, isnt it?
What, are you serious...why, why did she call?
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?
The main thing is to keep the line moving.
All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've flown first class, Elaine-- I can't go back to coach. I can't... I won't...
Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?
I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!
Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.
(A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.
Did you look at look at this picture carefully?
So, ah, what are you doing around here Ramon?
So, Puddy, I decided Im gonna go with another 900 convertible.
(interrupts)like a shark fisherman with a bucket of (?) Ch....
Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?
Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you?
No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.
Well, go in there and talk to her. She's not going to put em on the glass.
You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world "I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable." (George is baffled)
Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.
Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.
Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes outside)
If there's a serial killer lose in your neighborhood, it seems like the safest thing is to be the neighbor. They never kill the neighbor. The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right? "Oh, he was kind of quiet." I love these neighbors. They're never disturbed by the sounds of murdering, just stereo. Chain saws, people screaming, fine. Just keep the music down. And all these women who always fall in love with the serial killer. They write to him in prison. Here's a woman that's hard to disappoint. I guess she's only upset when she finds out he's stopped killing people and she goes "You know sometimes I feel like I don't even know who you are anymore".
You cant go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!
Oh, what do you think? I found it at the back of my closet.
I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.
Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!
Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.
You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.
Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?
Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.
Elaine got a new number because she died.
Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.
Come on, Go in, go in! [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again]
Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...
Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!
I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar.
I know. Im really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.
George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?
And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?
How about we leave and, come back in a week?
Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!
Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?
You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught.
We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.
Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do?
It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?
I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.
"Wait a second ..Where you wearing those shoes in the cab?"
She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?
Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.
All right, now you call it in the air.
Elaine? How did you rope her into this?
Ohh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands. So.. (Goes for his coat)
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.
Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. (To Kramer) I never should have cashed those checks!
Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!
I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?
Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, Ill see ya.
Pull yourself together. Your going in there soldier! That's an order!
So what are calling me six times a day?
(answering machine) leave a message and I?ll call you back, thanks. JOE DIVOLA Jerry, Joe Divola. *Pbt* *Pbt* *Pbt* I have a hair on my tongue, I can't get it off, you know how much I hate that? Course you do, you put it there. I know what you said about me Seinfeld. I know you badmouthed me to the execs at NBC, put the kibosh on my deal. Now I?m gonna put the kibosh on you. You know I?ve kiboshed before, and I will kibosh again.
I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.
No, I dont think so. Ive seen you two together. You make each other miserable. Its kismet.
You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!
He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly . I would like to have a good show.
Oh (laughing) Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting.
Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.
Oh right, the new job, how is it?
How can you talk to someone like that?
Well you're not even a fan. I was at game six - you didn't even watch it.
Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! No!!! Thank you. (Hangs up.) I don't believe this. They've added Bania to the network showcase and he's going on right after me.
Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist enters Monk's)
Oh the baby's fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt.
(Excited) I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!
(Handing her a small bottle) Here, drink this.
It's like Im talking to my Aunt Sylvia here.
My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin' "where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?"
We're gonna have to talk about this later. (Elaine holds the door open for Jerry while holding her leg) Thank you. Taxi!
Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?
She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.
Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.
(livid) Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one!
I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to Jack)
Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on.
Im a guy  it always looks like that.
I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket.
Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document.
(stares at George, incredulous) "Back on"? What was it doing off?
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!
George, this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on. (Jerry leaves.)
This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.
(continuing to pack) That's a nice four seconds.
I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?
(Nodding) I think you may have something there.
Well, we fight a lot for some reason.
Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.
O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!
Well I, I can't believe this. I know Phil, he, he's a good friend of mine. We play softball together. How could this be?
No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.
(a la "Don Corleone") Never go against the family, Elaine.
Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.
Just put a coffee table book over it.
Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?
Ate? What? What the hell are you talking about? Now you listen to me, you get out of that apartment this instant. If you screw this up for me I swear....
..And then she starts talking about her panties.
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.
You'll be out before we get the check.
Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.
Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!
You're lying! You got it, I want that number!
Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.
He could have said "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.
(trying to defuse the situation) Look, no-one is lifting anything.
(thinking; quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?
When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers.
Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.
Okay, take it easy. (hangs up) That was Keith. we're going to do something next week.
But you said, it can be very serious.
Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally, yeah this is Jerry,I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and..
Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?
Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.
Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...
Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.
Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?
(accusing) You're not wearing a shirt, are you?
Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..
All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter)
So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.
Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.
I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!
Well, whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.)
Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)
What the hell he's supposed to be on medication I don't understand he told me he's getting medication what happened to his medication!?
Do you want me to break up with you?
Yeah. (hands racquet to Kramer) I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it.
What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of temperament?
You want to get something to eat first?
I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?
Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.
Suspected serial killer, he didn't actually do it.
Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?
So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right?
Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.
People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.
You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it?
There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a "Smell Gestapo". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush...
I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.
Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?
Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did!
Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.
Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.
Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)
I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.
Hey, look at the high score--"G.L.C." George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?
You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.
I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.
Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?
Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?
(looking outside) Hey Newman, is that your red car?
We didnt bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.
What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.
I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.
Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.
(pointing to Kramer's hair) You got some suds over here.
Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10?
Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?
So, how did you get up there? Did you say you had to use the bathroom?
I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is better?
Well, just give it back, and I wont say anything.
Ma, I told you, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan... Okay, bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Rava) My mother. She forgot how to make French toast. You know how mothers are.
Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.
Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up(?). Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.
I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've been so helpful.
We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.
Yes. I do love her. (to baby) You have a very nice place here.
Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.
(Chuckles) You don't know the half of it.
Elaine, George (introducing them to Bania with less enthusiasm)
Oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh that's terrific... Mulva.
Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.
...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, "Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now." "This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration." You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration, (waves imaginary wallet) "Here's fifty-six people that know me." Cop goes. "Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check."
You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But its really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesnt it? "I really am a doctor you know. You think Im not, just check it out." I dont know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. "Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and Ill give you my opinion." After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what theyre talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants.
Whats the difference?! Thats the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!
Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.
Oh yeah, well why don?t you Just get lost.
There he is. He's going into that bar.
People dont turn down money. Its what separates us from the animals.
No, it's tarragon. Hey Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had about you having my apartment keys and everything.
I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, its very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, Call the police. You really should call the police. So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, Yeah, Im calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... Im gonna see some real action. Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out The Report. They give you Your Copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I dont really think were gonna crack this case, do you? Its not like Batman, where theres three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up, hes dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him, hes a PENGUIN!
No ,no I don't, I mean, Don't be silly..
Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination? You couldn't possibly visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life size snotty puppet. I guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. That's the end of the line for a mannequin. "What ever happened to Bob?" "Have you seen that new Volvo commercial? He's got a bulls eye right in his face." Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, I guess these are the two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves. Well dressed or getting killed. I'm sure there is some pro-mannequin organization that doesn't even like you to use the term mannequin. "Hey they're not mannequins, they're the life deprived."
You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.
Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch?
Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?
He used to go there a lot on business.
(Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.
I didn't know it was possible not to know that.
I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.
I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table.
I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.
I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.
Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.
Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in.
(Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) I didn't say anything.
Okay, how about this I'm in my apartment, you come in.
You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.
Yeah, well that relationships really got a lot of potential.
If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?
Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa.
No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.
Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'
Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.
(Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?
Well it's been quite a night I could sure use a cup of coffee.
I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.
But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.
Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. I'm being audited.
Have you noticed people staring at your head?
Oh and I've got some things of yours here.
Oh, Okay (turns to rest of table) Im sorry, I didnt know what to bring, nobody told me.
(Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah?
We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, hey maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!?
(To George, in a 'cha-ching!' motion) Vermont! (To Ellen) With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to! (George is disturbed. He gets up, goes go Kramer's door, and knocks. They talk) Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I can't wait.. buy-bye. (Hangs up. George and Kramer come into Jerry's apartment, confronting him) What? (George takes the phone off the hook) What is this?
Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.
I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?
But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?
(answering, quickly) If you know what happened in the Met game, dont say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, Im sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no
(yelling) Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.
No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.
Im takin it, Im takin the place. Im gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. Im livin here...Im movin.
I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
All right. Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot. (hangs up)(to George) Casting tomorrow at NBC. 400. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful. (George looks disappointed)
I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.
What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?
We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)
Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something?
AH. Yes that's gonna make a big difference.
Sure. See, things always even out for me.
Well you might as well look it over.
When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion.
Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!
You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The Mohel circumcised my finger!
(on the phone) Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.
Yeah Ive got this old bottle of cough medicine.
I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.
Not because youre dirty, not because youre clean  just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine...
We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.
(Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.
(on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel! (hangs up the phone very disappointed)
You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
Who do you know? He knows my hair.
No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.
No, no......(long pause . they stare at the walls) Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?
You know, I think I'll just take the check.
What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?
You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.
Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.
Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.
That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.
(Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after him!
Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?
Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?
(looking at the Wizard) Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents.
Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!
So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?
I think it has something to do with me.
Oh I dont know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing.
You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events.
I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.
Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?
All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?
She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass.
Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, "Make sure you hang on to your jacket."
Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!
Did you at least get him a card?
Just, uh, plop it on the counter there.
She was looking for someone to go to the show with.
Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?
Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?
Okay.. (Opens the door to a frantic Elaine)
(into the phone, with a disguised voice) So, what's going on?
Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.
(on phone) Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act (pauses for response from Adrian) No new material (Elaine enters) He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week, it killed. (waves hello to Elaine; pauses for response from Adrian) Thank you, thanks fo.. you will not regret this. Ok, Bye. (hangs up phone; to Elaine) Hey.
Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!
Oh, heh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.
Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are?
George! Can we focus on the car, here?
No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.
'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.'
You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is! I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, someone asks me which way is Israel, I don't fly off the handle.
Coach to India - The only way to go.
No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?
Great, I had fun. Wheres the TV, wheres the VCR?
Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours. (And with that, Jerry made the most fatal mistake of his life)
What's going on here. How is that possible?
It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to go?
Well you've really built yourself up into something.
Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)
Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income.
Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?
So what about the "Maestro" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.
Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?
I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.
(Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.
Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.
Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.
Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls down, make it an eight room luxury suite.
Yknow what? This is not that bad an idea.
By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?
Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.
I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?
So Marcelino's going to take down the check?
No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.
I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.
Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?
I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?
Uhm, hold, hold on a second. (pauses counting) I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.
(tucking in his shirt) Oh ya this is Rachel.
Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.
I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? (Kramer holds a broken Tony)
Well we went out one time. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
Why dont they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, Just Back. All back; No front. You walk in the front, youre immediately in the back. (Jerry picks up a tie display, and shakes it rhythmically from left to right.) Look, Elaine, tie carwash.
(hits button) Come on up. (opens door a little)
Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.)
Oh, were meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building.
Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist.
He really did an amazing job. Look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid! (Jerry opens refrigerator.) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups! Come here, look at this. (He gets on his knees and points.) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there?! He must be like Rubber Man!
Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.
This is no good. This is no good. Call her house.
Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?
If you need more time, you should have more time.
Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?
(eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.
Hey you know we were just talking about you.
Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.
(watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this?
(struggling to open a bottle with his bandaged finger) I can't do it. (A LA GODFATHER) Look what they did to my boy, They massacred my boy.
oh you're afraid he might look like Zippy the pinhead
That's funny, that's funny! "I'm sick of cleaning." That's very funny.
Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?
Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.
Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.
We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.
He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal.
You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. (Picks up the phone.) She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...
Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
(Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that line?
So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?
Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things about you from George.
(to Rava) So, wheres this boyfriend of yours? I cant wait much longer. Ive got a flight.
Don't feel right? What are you talking about?
(to Kessler) Yeah. (to the phone) Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem.
Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to begin with! Let's face it. I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's that!
It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.
Thank you very much, that's great- >click< Oh! Hold on a sec, I got a call on the other line. >click click< Hello?
(looking behind the counter) Hey, is that Babu? It is! (walking over) Hey, Babu!
And where does it end? Then everyones doin it. Its like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, "Dont go there." - Someones gotta take a stand!
I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.
No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!
Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.
Understand you had a little talk with him too.
What are you looking at? (Kramer goes out onto the terrace and looks down.) Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold.
A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business.
"Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable..." Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been "outed"! I wasn't even "in"!
No no come on really, get another one. Itll take a second.
Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!
(reluctant) Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too.
Wait a second. (Grabs the icebucket off the counter.) This'll scare 'em off. (Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. Jerry gets back into bed.) Well, good night, Ollie.
Shes limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.
Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.
I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy.
(shouting) Kramer what am I going to do did you hear that that guy's gonna put a kibosh on me he's crazy he's out of his mind....
Well, thats a lot of money. But, if thats the way its gotta be, thats the way its gotta be.
(firmly matter-of-fact) Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.
Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?
Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!
Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?
So, uh, whats your son doing now, Dr. Stevens? Oh, hes a public fornicator. Yes, hes a fine boy...
You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.'
All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a specimen.
Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.
It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something.
By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?
That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice.
Yeah, Im going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days.
He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it.
No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.
Maybe we should get you to a hospital.
Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.
Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.
Well maybe he's got like a, cheerful mental hold on you.
That orange dress is burned in my memory
Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?
Oh, excuse me... Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.
Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.
(adamant) No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back.
(ranting) I can't believe how a little thing like George going too fast - and my whole weekend is gone - the plans, the packing, ... everything.
Yknow I think that even if youve had a relationship with someone, or lets say, especially if youve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, its very difficult. Isnt this? Its hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. Its like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, Look, a rabbit. The other goes, So? I believe this is your card. Look, why dont we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?
It's Kramer isn't it? I knew it!  The greasy door knob the constant licking of the fingers, he's hooked to the chicken isn't he?
Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania)
While you were in jail. So you're free.
Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''. And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. "Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''.
So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these types of people.
So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.
(about the massage)You know I think this is really helping.
Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane enters)
So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything.
No,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.
No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him.
(to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?
You know I went out once with a nude model. Never let me see her naked. Hundreds of people see her naked every week, except me. Needless to say it was quite vexing.
I just got the most bizarre message from you father, Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!
(scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.
Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room, searching for the TV.) ELAINE!
Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?
Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!
C'mon up. (To George) Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'
Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?
(suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.
(CONT'D) And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.
Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order)
I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
(reaching into his pocket) Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for it.
Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.
I got a date with that girl, Lena.
I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something.
So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.
Sure, Beth, these things happen. (Brief pause) So, have you told many.. people yet?
Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?
Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?
Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon?
Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?
Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.
hunky.. Tony.. hey hey hey (fools around with his collar again)
Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father.
I know, and then you say to yourself, From this moment on, Im not gonna waste any more of it. But then you go, How? What can I do thats not wasting it?
(holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the fridge?
Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad.
Don't you see what's goin' on here???... No boxers, no Jockeys...
You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.
Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.
Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.
How many session did my parents paid for?
Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.
Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?
(playing Scrabble with his naked girlfriend) Zephyr? That is not a word.
Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people.
Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.
Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.
I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?
(uncertain) Don't you hire people to do that?
Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.
The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.
(Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.
What are you gonna do about the roommate?
And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.
Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?
What, theres something wrong with Loni Anderson? (pause) Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it.
I can't believe your a friend of mine.
I don't know, but you don't have it.
Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?
Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.
Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.
(On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.
"Guys And Dolls"? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?
Yeah! I got it . It's in the apartment, but we can't go in there it's being fumigated.
Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.
I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping.
Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.
Dirt? That's alright, (for Jenna's benefit) because there's nothing wrong with dirt.
So I guess , you're not getting married?
Which part? The renovating the restaurant you dont own part or spending the two hundred million you dont have part?
You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?
I'm sorry, Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen)
Yes, come on! How often do you get engaged? Come on!
(realising) Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. It belongs to the Friars Club.
That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his fathers band. Hed loan it to you.
Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up...
George, I am loving this no wallet thing.
Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?
I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didnt want to talk to, I could go, Excuse me, Im not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away. I also have a cordless phone, but I dont like that as much, because you cant slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone  You cant talk to me like that! Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone  You cant talk to me like that!
He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.
I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.
Inka-dink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink.
Why don't you put it in the *bank*?
That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is.
He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.
I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.
Damn, I was too overanxious, he must have noticed that.
Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.
I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.
I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!
You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial.
I'll get you another one just like it!
Well, I'm very mysterious by nature. (Jerry knocks on the door) A lot of women find that attractive.
No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.
They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again.
I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door...
Okay. (closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self) Didn't come true.
(to Bania) Excuse me. (he goes back in the dressing room)
All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...
Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.
(Stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. (Approaches the intercom) C'mon, let's get it together.. (Through intercom) Yeah?
I didn,t tell you to park in that lot .. Now someone's gonna have to drive you every time you need your car.? Take the bus!
Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?
That's the last babka. They got the last babka.
Well, I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.
(to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?
Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
There you go. That'll get you home in time.
How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable special . I 've never gotten a cable special.....well that's it I'm not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado. (to the silent Kramer on the couch beside him) ...Exactly.
Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!
Well at least you and I are okay again.
Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday.
Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.
I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.
Look Kramer, i-i-if I'm gonna live over there, y-y-you gotta take some of this stuff out. I mean this thing is really freaking me out (holds up a ventriloquist dummy). I feel like its gonna come to life in the middle of the night and kill me.
My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while.
What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back.
So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!
You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.
Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it They're roommates. She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back. She's not gonna do that.
What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.
See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! Then come out with the regular!
So get this we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.
Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.
How you gonna get out of *that* one?
Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that.
I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)
I noticed she's big on the phrase "yada yada."
Good, as a matter of fact. I almost had my own show in Japan.
Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.
If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened.
(Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.
No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I dont know her name.
They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?
Why can't you do this on your table?
Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.)
(places two slices of bread against Kramer's face) That is close.
Why did you force that mint on me? I told ya I didn't want the mint!
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
Well, what's going on? What is this thing?
I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.
Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....
"No no you said George likes spicy chicken."
It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.
Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.
No kidding. (thinking) Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!
What happened you didn't give her the papers?
You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up)
Oh, o.k. (Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.)
I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around..
Listen, Joel. Theres something I have to tell you...
So you want me to get the books? Is that it?
We found out his super power was lack of money.
I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I dont get this. Arent cows outside most of the time? I dont understand it. When its raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, Let us in, were all wearin leather. Open the door! Were gonna ruin the whole outfit here! Is it suede? I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I cant have this cleaned. Its all I got!
Elaine, you cannot judge a person on a situation like that. I mean it's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert
Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.
Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail.
That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.
How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean, it's only this wide!
Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)
He's a boy who lives in a bubble.
Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?
Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?
have some more, take some for the road.
No, I told you I admire your hearing.
Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?
Uh, you don't have to take a picture.
Is it...? Could it...? Could he have...? IT IS! (Grabs Kramer.) Poppie peed on my sofa!!
Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.
Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.
All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm away, gets phone) now... the failsafe. The wake-up guy... (dials)
All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.
So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, hes thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, theres nothing left?
yeah yeah what is it with you and Tony? what are you? it's like his sidekick now?
The bad fianc&Mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...
They sealed him up with the mint inside.
I dunno, watch it on TV I guess. Why?
(looking after the guys) That nut is always up to something.
It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.
(pointedly) Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars.
(sarcasm) Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.
I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the plot. It's embarrassing. It's an embarrassment to have to admit, but I'm the one that you see in the parking lot after the movie talking with his friends, going, "Oh, you mean that was the same guy from the <beginning>... Ohhhhhhhhhh..." Nobody will explain it to you. When you're in the theater, you can't find out. [whispering to imaginary friends seated around him] "Why did they kill that guy?... Why did they kill him?... Who was that guy? What was the... I thought he was with them? Wasn't he with them? Why would they kill him if he was with them? Oh, he wasn't *really* with them.... I thought he was with them. It's a good thing they killed him.''
How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!
she's one of these people, always have to be different
He went crazy from one note. He couldnt get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.
Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?
... I think. Have some more wine. (Jerry pours his whole glass of wine into her glass.)
Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything.
It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.
She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.
Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay... is uh...
(locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.
You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --
Wait a second. .Just give me a second
Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.
All I said was "I like the pen".
Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. (indicating) Come on in. You got the cigars?
Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it.
With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.
(quietly, yet in a high and whiney tone) Well, I don't know if I....
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!
I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.
(picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt off?
Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.
Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.
But you know... not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me.
(throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?
This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!
You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.
Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city.
We won. Were in the finals on Wednesday.
What do you mean you don't think so?
No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.
Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)
(Scoffing) Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.
For crying out loud, He's Superman. (Fulton stops laughing, Jerry's face is stunned) Fulton? (looks at him) Fulton?
I cant. Shell get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.
(seeing Kramer struggle to open a soda, spilling it all over) I think the damage is probably already done. (interrupting Kramer's inadequate attempt to clean up the soda) All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene.
They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
You don't even know what a write off is.
All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff.
Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?
I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?
This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-
Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.
Thats the bet! That youre not doing it!
I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something.
So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?
Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?
Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...
She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?
Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.
You know, I really need to use the bathroom.
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, that?s not fair, what about George, Susan and Elaine, what do you need me for?
I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.
(on the phone) Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.
Hey...I'm not stupid. I'm looking in that drawer, there's no can opener.
It's gotta have something to do with Kramer
She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.
(Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine?
Babu? Babu...[waves Babu to come to table] Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just, it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?
Not our "all the way", their "all the way." I got the stink of responsibility on me.
All right, all right. Whats the big hubbub, bub?
Have you said anything to her about it?
Um, I haven't got my watch on. It's being fixed.
You know what? No champagne. Anyway. . . I'll see you later.
Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing...
(While digging in his pocket for some money, he looks over the shirts one last time) You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt..
Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.
Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?
Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that.
I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.
Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.
Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions.
(to waitress) I' ll just have a cup of coffee.
(Looking down at the shirt; mumbling) Oh, thank you.
No, but ah, seen any good movies lately?
Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.
So, its okay? I could just tell her she can have it?
George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.
All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.
We make all these plans - this idiot goes a hundred miles an hour - the whole weekend's over - incredible - just like that -
It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.
(in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.
When did you get tickets to see that?
Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss.
I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.
I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.
Ah, just, you know, I don't know. Stuff, I gotta do. (grabs coat and throws it over his shoulder)
Hmm, I really need to speak with him.
Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.
Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.
hey, uh.. (Kramer walks around a little) what'd you get there?
Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.
Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.
Well, its a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno...
Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?
No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!
Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.
Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.
George- What?! Youre kidding... Well, whats wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, Ill speak to you later. (He hangs up.) Wilkinson, the guy whos supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, hes in the hospital.
The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting out that marriage.
Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.
Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD.
(Kramer shows Jerry and Elaine the paper) "Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research".." Government funds genetic research at area hospital" ... Yeah, so?
(rising) I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the speed-dial.
So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.
Best friend- Ive never been to your apartment.
I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?
Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.
(holding up the '# DAD' shirt) We're even.
Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!
It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?
Ah, dinner! Thats it, youre all the way back!
Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money..
Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.
Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, "Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land." (Imitates cannon operator) "I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you."
Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.
What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him? 'Cos I asked him about the Knicks?
Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?
I know enough not to get on them.
Id really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.
Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door)
It's not even my car, it's a rental.
Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.
(uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.
No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car.
We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!
You really used to have a think full head of hair.
How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?
Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
Hey, get out of here...hey officer, he's fooling around back here.
You can't. That's why they lose very few players.
(leafing through his mail) Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.
(Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.
Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.
That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.
Well, Ill tell you what. Ill choose you for it. Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...thats it, you gotta win three.
No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.
You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.
Actually, I did. I put it on last night and slept in it.
I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?
(sarcastically) Yeah, Levine. And Im Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.
Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!
(to Kramer and Morty) What is this about?
It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck!
Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it.?
The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.
Youre wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!
I know. He got the hit in game SIX. So, so then what happened?
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.
Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!
We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk.
Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.
(Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here.
That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?
I tell ya, I don't see it happening.
This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.
No, but wait, wait And then you dump them off onto Kramer..
(TO GEORGE, REWOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?
I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?
You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.
I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship?
(To Nina) Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy, huh?
Who's got a tissues? I need more tissues! Look at this thing. It's my phone finger!
You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.
Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!
No, I dont eat dinner. Dinners for suckers.
No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me. She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised what's going on.
That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without the cushy timeslot.
So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.
(jumps in surprise) Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be gone.
Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!
Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine.
How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!
What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!
She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...
I did not. You guys gonna go through some red lights?
(pulling Leo back in) Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you.
(taps George's chest) Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six.'
No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage?
No, its, its just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it. (Jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) Ten-fifteen... No, dont be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, its no trouble at all... Ill see you tomorrow... Great, bye. (He hangs up the phone; to Kessler) I dont believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here!
Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.
What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?
Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
Come on up. (Jerry presses the second button and opens the apartment door. He walks back to the couch.) Oh, all right, forget it, Im gonna take it with me now... (He picks up the cushions.) Im just gonna pack up the cushions right now...
Why don't you just get rid of it?
No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.
Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?
Uh huh. When youre on a stakeout, do you find its better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?
You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!
Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
Okay, fine. (Jerry takes a coin from his pocket.) This is the official flip. No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and thats it. Agreed?
and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!
This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.
Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum.
And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.
All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go.
Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary.
Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.
What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?
Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.
Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.
Yeah. a-hu. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?
I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?
I'm gonna go let Elaine in. (Kramer reaches out to stop him leaving)
You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.
(accusingly) Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.
Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.
Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.
Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.
So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.
Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?
As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protg of my own.
Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?
All right Newman, one more peep outta you, you're out of the whole operation!
Look at this, my ankle's all bitten up.
Well thank you very much, it's about time.
Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley.
He asked me to. We were getting along.
(stands, puzzled, it's not sinking in) W-what do you mean?
People are going to steal from you. You cant stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker, whos gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They cant get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.
It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.
YEAH? (speaking loudly so the visitor can hear him through the intercom)
(reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.
Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?
Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed like ten new minutes.
So you have no control over the remote?
And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus
So I know this guy. Im getting all my sneakers at a discount now.
(walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!
Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess youre not going in anymore.
Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.
So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?
Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line.
Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door.
We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? (turns to George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George?
Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our prices, we'll give you the store.
So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up The good, the bad, or the ugly.
Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. (holds his nose up like a pig) You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.
I can't go to sleep at nine o clock!
Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog strangler. (George leans close) would you suck a mint or something. Can I come right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where we are. Where are we?
Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.
Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.
Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper of the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack . . .
A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guys got a coma going like this  you dont want to mess with it.
...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're there approving new clothes.....That's a girlfriend job! How dare he!!
Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.
Of course she doesnt have five thousand dollars!
(Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key?
Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?
No! [throws her purse back at her] No, I mean, no thank you, nah...
Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.
Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind.
"...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!"
Look at you, youre still thinking about it. Ill never feel comfortable.
(to Elaine) Where's Kramer? Shouldn't he be here by now.
OK ... (nodding his head up and down) This is it cha know
Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house?
Elaine, how about this shirt? Is this okay?
Oh, like you know what you're talking about!
(leaving; singing) She'll be coming around the mountain...
Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved.
(Surprised to see her, he gets up) Where's George?
Elaine its her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back.
(handing his dad a gift) Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.
My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didnt want to move to Florida, but theyre in their sixties, and thats the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old peoples house with a golf cart, jump out, Lets go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. Drop it! I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversations so boring. Its so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, What if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass. You know. Come back in, theres broken glass, everybodys all upset. No, Im all right. I was just a little bored there. And uh no, Im fine. I came back. I wanted to hear a little more about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Lets pick it up right there.
Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.
And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.
No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.
They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!
Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test?
Look, what do you want me to do?
You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!
Hell have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
So what happened? You gave her my tax papers? ... My papers?
Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?
(also wearing a moustache) What do you mean, 'what is it?' It's a country right next to Belgium.
Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting.
Oh, about the... uh (Jerry pretend to wash his hands)
My moms down in Florida. Shes got uh one of those condos. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?
So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial?
Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)
Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and find my number.
I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?
(Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.
Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?
(Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?
Fine all done, just looking for the soap.
Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.
Well if he's going then I'm not going.
The captain of the toes. (phone rings) Hello.
Kramer, (Trying to pass him) get outta my way!
I dont know. Theyve been in there since, like, World War II. The rents three hundred a month.
Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men
George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.
Well, it was the best of those movies.
(Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla.
How come? I told you - It's fantastic.
There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.
But you made it through the day before.
Vanessa, thank you. Ive been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.
Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.
I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.
Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.)
There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?
(To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.
I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.
Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.
How long are you suppose to leave it on for?
Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again.
Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, its with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I mightve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.
Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
Vandelay Industries, Kel Varnsen speaking. May we help you? ... Oh Hi Keith. Na, I was just jokin' around
Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?
Uh-huh, yeah. (Smiling, nodding, clearly wanting Bryant to shut up)
(acidly) Shes full. So, Big Daddy. Im just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?
I like that. (He opens the closet. Elaine walks out with an angry look.) What do you think, George?
So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?
(While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands him a nickel)
You like the couch? Ill tell you what Im gonna do.
Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.
So you want to catch a movie later?
Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for membership.
Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.
(Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying.
She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?
No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first.
I just thought ahh maybe I could talk to Roy, if um
Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer enters)
I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.
Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.
Yea. (pulls at the t-shirt) This is Golden Boy's son Baby Blue.
all right lets be reasonable, Bania. Im taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal.
I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that.
Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.
That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's.
You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.
What the hell...? Why is the door open?
I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!
You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you... (catches himself)
Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel.
Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.
What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?
But you did actually throw his coat out the window.
You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?
Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.
I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.
Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them.
Great, you're lonely and miserable again. (presses button to call elevator)
What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police dont use them for, you know, crowd control. (Jerry crouches down, and makes like hes riding a pony.) Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, Im talking to you. Behind the barricades! So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldnt it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... Baltic, thats two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, thats it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.
Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing "no") A little taste! (still shaking) Come on. (still shaking)
Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.
I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.
Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them.
He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.
Well, I brought them up there to take his records--
That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?
I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.
But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment shes going right for that machine.
Well, you know what they say. Lucky in love, Unlucky with fruit.
(examining the button) Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like a tooth.
Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.
Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something.
(removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?
So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy.
So you want to just abolish all home package deliveries.
Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...)
Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine?
Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.
Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George "Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again."
Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.
I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?
Oh, oh take it back. Let's get another one.
You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.
I've hardly been out to dinner with them.
Kramer , there's no way you're sleeping with me.
Ow. Stupid fold-out! Why'd they put the bar in the middle of the bed?
Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned it...
Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.
Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.
Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.
Id rather not say it out loud. Its embarrassing.
Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?
(Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! A dinosaur!
No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.
You stink. You know you stink. What is this?
Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've never heard anything like this in my life. Listen to this.
Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.
Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, "Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. " "What are you watching?" "I don't care, I gotta keep going." "Who was that?" "I don't know what it was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going." Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, "Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel." You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, "Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of here. I'm going to bed."
So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk.
I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!
All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.
And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises.
It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.
What, do you think I care about the money? Is that what you think? You want me to show you what I care about money? Here look, here look at this, here's a dollar here look, there, that?s how much I care about money.
I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.
Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what are you doing?
Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?
Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye.
Let me have a look at this thing.
How do you get all that wood in here?
I'm not paying for anything until I get that back.
Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?
Well, Im sure you did. Who wouldnt love a pony? Who wouldnt love a person that had a pony?
So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought ... What a coincidence. We're just about to eat.
Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?
Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives. (Picks up phone and dials) Hello Tim? Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you? Well it turns out I can use them. Oh, you do? I understand. Okay. Bye. He already made plans, he can't change them.
Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.
Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.
You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.
It's not one of those 976 calls, is it?
(like a frustrated child) Why can't I know?
Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you.
So it had nothing to do with you.
Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?
(shrugs) Hey George I think I want to bring a date to the wedding
Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.
People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I never know what to write on these things. I hate doin' this.
What did you have to give your TV away to George for?
I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.
Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.
I really have to go to the bathroom.
Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.
It has nothing to do with whose house it is.
You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.
That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.
All right. How 'bout this one let's say you're abducted by aliens.
Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!
I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.
Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?
Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.
(annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? Besides it's not a submarine and there's no room for a periscope in a car.
No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.
Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.
What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasnt the one.
September 21st, first day of Autumn. Leaves changing colours.. Beautiful colors.
So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?
You're pretty comfortable up there eh, Bubble boy?
Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.
What are you bringing snowballs in here for?
It has nothing to do with her sister.
Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.
Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.
Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?
(to George) He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.
Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it.
Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.
I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?
Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that?
(opening the door) Well, it was nice meeting you.
(looks in the creamer) Theres no milk in here, what...
You know my parents are coming in and I got some clean up to do , so if you and Potsie are done scheming....
hello. Oh, hi. What's happening?  what? oh um, sure,  um, yeah, okay, uh. I'll see you then. Yeah, yeah, Bye.
Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?
Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strange the whole flight?
Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?
So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did?
Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?
Come in for two minutes and sit with me.
They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives.
Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though.
It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.
What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with. [To attendant] What is going on?
Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.
What? (Kramer hands Jerry an envelope) My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it?
Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.
So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.
Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.
Oh! Rimsky -- great great book if I may say so sir. I almost read the whole thing.
You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.
Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.
Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting.
Hey look at this. What is going on here?
I thought it was open to the public.
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you dont have to be home on time.
This is Outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit.
Well, theres this uh, woman might be comin in.
Alright Kramer, enough of this. Let's go find George.
I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you?
But then we would have missed the whole thing.
Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches)
Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference who's tall. We're all tall.
I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.
Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!
(To himself) I don't believe this! (Walks over to a security guard) Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with shoplifting..
And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's pretty sick.
Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, "Why knock my brains out?"
Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
"I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite."
It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!
Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I-I just wanted to ask you a question when we we're going out did you have orgasms?... Okay, thanks... No that's it... Ya, Okay, bye.
Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?
Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! Nice job on the circumcision but it's not supposed to be a finger.
I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.
You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.
(explaining) I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.
I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.
So he's been lying to me for two months?!
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.
You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!
Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see her tonight.
Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.
(more disgusted) Ohhhh! You cant! Its impossible! Theres no break in the conversation where you can go, All right then... You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.
You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?
She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.
(tapping the spatula while waiting for waffles to be done) Any second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready.
Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?
I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.
He was in the shop. I thought you told me he wasn't going to be there.
(as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people.
Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour, then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night.
I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!
Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.
The apple pie you had today at Monks
Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there?
to himself Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.
Let me call him back... Hello? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.
Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)
Listen to this "I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."
Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.
Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--
Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.
So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.
So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. Whats the matter?
Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.
Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?
You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?
I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?
Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.
You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.
Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you.
Good. And Ill tell you what... You dont have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.
(Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-
Are you sure? Oh boy, here we go.
Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and tear.
What do you mean they're not going to do anything, they're the cops, they gotta do something, he just put the kibosh on me, do you know what the kibosh means, its a kibosh!
Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.
I didnt tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog?
But I don't know if this is gonna work.
What is that? (Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.)
Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now?
They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
So, you wanna come up for a few minutes?
Don't you ever talk about her like that!
(seeing that Kramer has a new watch) What's that?
Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?
How come you're eating your peas one at a time?
Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it!
You didn't ... (makes motion like he's lighting a cigar)
(in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room) Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad, you look so different.
(looking over the list) Hmm ah. I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?
I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.
(standing in the bathtub) Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.
So she kicked him out of the apartment.
What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?
I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go "Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!"
Is there a captain's hat involved in this?
I dont know. Its got a pink lining.
So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?
I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright, I'm dropping you off at work, right?
Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.
The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.
He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. "I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"
Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...
No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.
How could she not tell me where she was staying?
How late are the stores open? Im thinking of maybe uh, buying a new TV and smash it over my head.
Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.
Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why dont we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. (All three sit down) Now, look, you both find each other attractive, right?
You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?
Yeah, I know. There's no call for that kind of attitude.
No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?
Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you.
Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease?
You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!
On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?
Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.
Hey what about Dr. Resnick My Uncle Leo is going to see him tomorrow .
I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!
Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.
Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.
Do you have to write all this stuff down.
There's girls everywhere. I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator. They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?
Yeah, theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.
Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.
Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.
Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.
Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.
And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?
And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.
By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.
If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like Lex Luthor.
So as he's telling the story he starts crying.
No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'
Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!
Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.
Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. (Holds lettuce head) Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts the intellect, represented here (Pulls off tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large piece) Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats tiny piece of lettuce)
What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.
I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?
I just want a, touch em a little.
Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.
Well, that's it! Tonight's the night. I'm getting one. No "if and's or but's".
No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?
Because you were too busy stealing a book.
So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.
(Shouting) Come on up! (Opens his door for Elaine)
That puddle! (Kramer sees the puddle and does a double-take.)
Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...
I really think the M&M should be you.
Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money?
wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to just sense it's in front of the couch?
I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?
Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.
(to the phone) Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you- Oh, Hi. Joel... Oh, you just came in... Listen, I cant make it to the game tonight... I, uh, have to tutor my nephew... Yeah, hes got an exam tomorrow... Geometry... You know, trapezoids, rhombus... Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. Theyre at the Will-Call window... And Im really sorry... Have a good time... Well talk next week... Okay... Yeah, I dont... Fine.. Fine... Bye.
(Unsure of what to say - he remember's Leo's courtesy tip) Hello?
So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?
We're in the middle of a discussion here.
OUR LIVES!! . What kind of lives are these? We're like children. We're not men.
Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!
Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give it back to me.
(Takes the bottle from him) Just swallow 'em.
I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.
You know, Gary (slams shut the door) I had a little chat with George the other day...
Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.
(picking up the phone and dialing) It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.
Not that I would think of doing such things.
What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?
You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-
Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.
(Stopping him) No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!
Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?
Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.
Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.
(to George) All right, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend Im disappointed. Youre going to really see me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this. Maybe you should go in the other room.
Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at no more than three miles an hour.
(to himself) Hoh, that Milos. (to Patty) Well uh, what shall we do, uhm, care for a cup of coffee?
Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?
I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy.
You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.
Well, I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble.
(re-entering) Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again, are you?
I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.
Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.
Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.
Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..
Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, you were right. I'll do anything!
(to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)
An inch! Can you move over an inch?!?
Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.
(accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?
Well, your day's getting more interesting already. (Jerry shows the phone) Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.
George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I?
Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?
Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment. How 'bout I make it up to you with dinner?
Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!
Oh! my god. What the hell is this? ..... Don't tell me.......Velvet!!!
No. I think it's Demi. (the "i" sounds like an "e")
I mean it's a terrible mistake, I mean he thinks I ruined some deal of his at NBC, I don't know anything about any deal at NBC.
The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke. (The phone rings.) Thats probably Uncle Leo.
(to Kramer) Hold on a second. (to Morty) Hiya dad.
Kramer!!! (Jerry points to the lamp post they are about to crash into)
You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.
What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him? I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he?
You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. (with a British accent) "Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you".
Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.
So was I right? She likes me, right?
No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1,900 dollars.
And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.
No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, hes treatin me just like a regular customer, now!
You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...
(calmly getting up with plate of chicken) Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, (drops chicken into sink) was, for two.
The female orgasm is kinda like the bat cave, very few people know where it is and if you're lucky enough to see it you probably don't know how you got there and you can't find your way back after you left. There are two types of female orgasms, the real and the fake. And uh I'll tell you right now, as a man, we don't know. We do not know, because to a man sex is like a car accident and determining the female orgasm is like being asked 'What did you see after the car went out of control?'. 'Uh I heard a lot of screeching sounds, uh I remember I was facing the wrong way at one point. And in the end my body was thrown clear.'
Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.
Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there.
Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle...
Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents.
See I was saying "six" but she thought I was saying "sex". We straightened the whole thing out though.
He never heard of corduroy! True story, true story.
Oh, I see. So you can go, "Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!"
Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!
You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. (Phone rings, he answers it) Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend.
Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.
You got it ALL wrong. I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoans
Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.
Y'know, I think I'll pass on the "Guys And Dolls"...
Look, its a very awkward situation. I dont wanna be presumptuous.
But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!
Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.
Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.
So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER
No don't do this. You're not doing this. I will fight you. No you don't... No.
Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.
(as Kristin is storming out) Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?
Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time.
Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.
(sharp) I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.
Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone to ghost read it.
Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet?
Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.
How long has your car been sitting in the Yankee parking lot?
I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)
The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be?
Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on.
I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.
Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job.
Yeah, okay. (to Elaine) They may have found the car.
So you go in the bathroom at eleven your in bed by what, two?
Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.
Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both killed!
I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem.
Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.
Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god. Wel-- how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud.
You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.
(taking out his wallet and handing over bills grudgingly) Fifty dollars.
That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact.
Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the check to Elaine) look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.
Ya. (hits the button, opens the door. To Elaine) Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys.
Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than "coffee machine show."
Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop, clip clop. They're nuts for it.
Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do.
So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George?
Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll watch 'em go slice this fat bastard up. (sips coffee)
Ive got the softball game on Wednesday. Its the championship.
There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.
If they were fanatic about showers, they might.
Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?
Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone)
Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.
It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.
Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. It'll crush him.
What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)
I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.
If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.
I'm callin' Elaine. See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley.
No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.
Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.
(animated) Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and you sold a Cadillac?!
Yes it will, now give me those keys!
It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. "It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad." But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, "I refuse to put any thought into this at all." Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?
So why don't you leave it at Newman's?
No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.
'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off the table.
Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?
It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.
I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.
She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator...
(quickly moves over toward Matthew) What the *beep*(fuck) are you doing? You little piece of *beep*(shit)!
Back and to the left Back and to the left
Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal [and, ala Carson] Wild, Wild, Stuff...
(to George) You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.
Let me see those. ( smells them) Oh! I know the chunky that left these Chunkies......NEWMAN!!! I've got him.
Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?
Ah, just remember when you see him tomorrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him.
Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. "I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other people. You won't be around me. But you will be around." "Take care now." Did you ever say that to somebody? "Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now." "Take care. Take care." What does this mean? "Take off!" Isn't that what you really want to say? "Take off now."
Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry pushes his door against Kramer's entrance]
I never heard anybody curse in a toast.
Shake is bad, but what if its the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?
You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...
Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.
What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.
But thats what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. Theyre knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus.
(quietly) Hey, uh, Milos, I don't mind rolling over here, but could you lighten up on the 'not a man' stuff?
Pam? What do you care? (Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying a Brentano's bookstore bag.)
(Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.
They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to rides alone.
(smugly, under-his-breath) Not only that, I broke his thumbs.
But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.
She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.
Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.
I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard.
What happened to the jacket. Did he take it with him?
Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.
Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy could write checks to himself right out of my account.
So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?
So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.
You got a lot to learn about pancakes.
No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.
Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger.
Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. Youve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?
She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.
Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?
(to Ramon) Oh. Okay. (to Elaine) Wh, what is he doing here?
I don't know, but you better keep it up.
W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.
Hey ,You think that Shelly's upset that I made such a big deal about the pecan.
(Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here..
I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.
Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?
It's a cigar store Indian. (to Elaine) Read the card.
The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.
I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?
Ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.
Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?
Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?
Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.
(smiling) Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.
Well, how much are you going to invest?
What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. (acts like he did in the movie) Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. (does the next look) I mean, beyond that, Im risking a punch in the mouth. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?
Well you can't take her maybe you can't take me either.
Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?
You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?
Hold it, hold it...Look your gonna need the jaws of life to get out of those things.
But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure.
Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? That's like half a pound of turkey!
You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!
That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
(Confirming) An alliance. (They both shake hands and laugh evily) Now get the hell outta here. (Newman leaves)
I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.
A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions) Ho, ho, ho.
It's like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action.
oh look at that I got oil all over me. Can I have your napkin?
So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?
The average person in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.
George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?
Yeah, Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would you describe Kramer's hair?
You told me that already like two months ago.
Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?
(To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up)
Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. (pretends to pull hair out)
I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin else.
(To Assistant) Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.
He feels funny. You don't have to do this.
He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man that's some tart cider!
The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper!
(pointing at the operation he mouths the words) Did it go in?
Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.
Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer!
Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.
Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?
Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?
(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I'm sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.
(picks it up) I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table.
I like that thing in your hair there.
..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Packyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of (wipes his brow) pizza and uh the uh and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling em (does juggling motions) he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. (Swallows and takes a breath) Well we all just lost it. (Fulton not laughing, stone faced) It was really really funny.
(surveying the restaurant) Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it!
Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?
Fourteen years down the drain. (points and walks off -- to the bathroom)
I did. Im just curious. Its been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points? (to Vanessa) Its up six points!
Kramer there's no way you stick to this.
It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.
I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.
What happened to your head when you got hit?
But they not you arent handicapped, arent you ashamed?
But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.
Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
(after a very awkward pause, cheerily) Hey, neighbor.
Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..
Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?!
Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.
I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?
My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on. (Kramer enters with a bucket and starts filling it with water on the sink) Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.
Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.
I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?
All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.
What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up.
(Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really?
I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I - I don't even remember the name of the town.
(in a hurry) Ya how you gonna get all this done in time?
No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe it. I lost him. That stupid idiot. Now what are we going to do?
I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.
I dunno , I'm gonna ask Shelley ,but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident.
Elaine? What does she have to - (notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.) Oh no...
Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.
So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.
So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.
Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little longer)
(Pointing out) It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for "Avast ye matey" - what the hell does that mean?! "20 degrees off the starboard side - the Spanish Galleon!" - there's no comeback for that!
My honest opinion, I think she made it up.
There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.
(Walks over and starts pulling on Kramer's pants) You just gotta wiggle your hips a little bit.
Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.
Do you want to go with him? You go. I dont mind.
Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. (Elaine smiles and rolls her eyes at him) What brings you here?
Oh that's George. (presses the intercom button) Yeah?
A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!
Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket.
Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.
It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?
Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.
Im just gonna get my jacket, Ill meet you downstairs. Whats the matter, did you call?
well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.
They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys.
I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there.
Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.
You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the "Astonishing Tales of Costanza".
You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?
H-Hey, Kramer, wait up. I'll go with you.
I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!
Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?
You dont have to say Wow. I know its Wow. (Kramer smiling) And theres that smile again. Well, what is that? (Intercom buzzes.) Its George.
Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.
(ironic outrage) The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!
Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?
Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.
All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.
Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?
Um, who do I make it out to?
(Continuing reading) "The Human Fund. Money for people."
So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?
Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?!
Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.
D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?
Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
Yeah thats a good deal -- you win the Pennant with that trade, hair for phlegm.
Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?
So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?
Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)
Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway.
I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
It would be nice to care about someone.
Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town.
(Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.
I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.
Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?
Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.
(reading) 'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie, hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'
So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm gonna try to sell the van to a lot.
You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!
Pretty good. I think she might be the one.
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese. (buys a newspaper out of a machine)
Oh, great. Ok we'll goin' away. I think I'm excited.
These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86.
Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!
Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?
And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.
Expecting Newman? That's funny because I just happened upon him down at the Kenny Roger's Roasters.
Ah, so, ah, flower shows and, shopping for pretty bows, and then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight?
He was running from a bee. (Elaine laughs)
What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I would've done, if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!!
No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.
Ohhh... You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.
Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!
I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.
But you gotta know how to work the projector.
Hello Elaine? Patty Lawrence had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?
Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?
(thinking) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft... (to Vanessa) Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit.
No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.
Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.
Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.
No I can't I've got some stuff to do then I've got to meet Keith at my apartment at three. I'm helping him move.
It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library
He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.
A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.
George, here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
All right, what are you gonna say to him?
You know it and I ditched all my junk food.
I had a very interesting lunch with GEORGE Costanza today.
(Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.
You should always carry a pad and pen.
Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket?
Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.
We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie.
Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye.
See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.
What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display. (takes the peanut butter jar away from George)
What you do say about a guy like this, huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. But your loyalty is beyond question.
(from the back of the club, leaving) That's it I'm calling in the big guns.
The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what youre doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? We have soda, we have soda, we have soda, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. Its a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and youre watching TV and youre drinking the exact same product that theyre advertising right there on TV, and its like, you know, theyre spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and Im standing there, Maybe Im putting too much ice in mine.
(Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this.
(to Elaine) So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?
I once got Happy New Yeared in March.
You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder?
So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...
Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.
Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.
I saw one once that could do sign language.
The dating world is not a fun world...its a pressure world, its a world of tension, its a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I dont know what they need. I know I dont have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one Im- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, were all human beings, what is the story? Ive never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, Ive never been in a situation, when I thought to myself I could use a cotton-ball right now. I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they dont need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, theyre like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? Theyre huge and two days later, theyre out, theyre gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin with them? The only time I ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, theres two or three, that look like theyve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I dont know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl whos left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I dont know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. Lets move on. The dating world is a world of pressure. Lets face it a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance youll end up naked at the end of it. You know? Well, Bill, the boss thinks youre the man for the position, why dont you strip down and meet some of the people youll be workin with?
Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.
Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that "Miss Congeniality" on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going? (Kramer enters.) Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey, what are you doing tonight?
Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup of Decaf. (leaves table)
Sure. (points at booth) How about this one?
Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.
Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up)
Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?
I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how theyre going to look at a thing like this.
Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.
Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.
He is merry, I'll give him that. (notices a cactus on the table) What's this plant for?
(proud to Peggy, under his breath) Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. (winks)
I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)
What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present)
Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
Hey. So, ah, Ramon this is my friend Elaine.
But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.
(To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?
Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?
So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.
I don't know. Who could've been in my apartment.
It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?
Yeah, I think it is. (They walk toward the man. Jerry hesitates.) Wheres Elaine?
I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no.
Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner.
How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet!
Ill have the, ah, turkey club without the bacon.
(picking at his moustache) You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.
Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!
And youre sure the floss was the catalyst?
Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations.
This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!
I'd be very interested in something like that.
We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.
Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.
Yeah, well, I didnt- Is that something you want to borrow?
It's like we're living in the '50s here.
No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!
The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang"...
Never. (The elevator door opens.) Wait a second. Thats her. On the right.
Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?
Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.
Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice?
And she wants to break up with you..
A half hour, give me a half our.
Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.
'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?
So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.
I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel.
Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. Shes usually pretty punctual. Dont you find that, George?
We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! Well be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life.
It's over there. I know where it is.
(Noting) You know, I've never seen you drive.
Aw! You'll be fine, you were in there for what , a couple of minutes.
I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that? (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying)
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?
Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door behind him)
I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?
You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president James Polk!" (ELAINE had echoed "Uh-huh. Yup." during it)
Its raining? Its raining. The game will be postponed. Well play tomorrow.
How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?
Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.
Yeah, Ill have the egg salad on whole wheat.
Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case.
Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about it!
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed...
What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.
What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I
Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really.
What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you.
Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!
Boy, It's the way they just slip it in there too.
Well, we've got to do something. (grabs his phone) I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.
Yeah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.
All right, I'll call 911. Think he did it? Could've he done it? Couldn't done it? How could've he done it? Couldn't be? Could it? Hello 911? How are you? I'm sorry it was just a reflex...I know it's an emergency number...it is an emergency...my friend is being accused of being a smog strangler and I know he didn't do it...they're putting me trough to the detective in charge of the investigation...what is my name? Who am I? I'm eh...George Costanza...
(doubtful) Yeah, you'll make it up to me.
Wow! Hey, theres Clare. I better go down.
No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.
Aw.. right, code of silence.. how's that going?....Ha!!...
Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?
Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?
Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...
What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying...
Oh, alright ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
(noticing Alec Berg walk in, whispers) Hey, Alec!
I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.
Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. He's a punk, a patsy, a hack.
Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door)
Hey ya know I read an unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the other day, did you know the original title for "War and Peace" was "War--What Is It Good For?"!
I love the day date. No wine, No shower.
Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... what kind of a sicko would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide (small fingers opening imaginary drawers) Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT hard to get round black buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this? ... is it such a great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, you'll never find them - they save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they're going to fall off too that's the other thing ...
Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up.
Cheque. Now, the fact is, if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, yknow, cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they dont know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster (Jerry draws imaginary book from a holster.) Who do I make it out to? Theres my ID. Theres something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I dont know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, I dont have any money, but if youll contact these people, Im sure theyll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I dont have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?
I think if ones going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. Its common courtesy. I dont know. Thats just the way I was brought up.
A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!
All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---
He was buying quite a load of chicken, almost for two people ...
A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.
Hey! Same initials . How do you like that?
(To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.
Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice.
Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)
Make sure you get this area here, where he needs the help....
(walking out) Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody.
George is pickin' us up at the airport.
And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?
Cops eating Milanos. What crazy town is this?
She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing to George) He likes the pop-in, too.
I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!
Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, "Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms."
Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.
I don't know. So what's this job of yours?
More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.
The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the other -person.
Now, all we gotta do is write it.
(Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So, the last person in should close the door!
Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.
Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.
(Joking around) Hey, didn't I beat you up in the fourth grade?
Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...
(unenthusiastic) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) Im just, Im really glad youre here.
They're ladies' glasses! You know all you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.
I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes.
Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.
Well, you want your organizer back don't you?
Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting. I'd have to get new friends. I'd have to get orgy friends. ... Naw, I'm not ready for it.
No, absolutely nothing. (They get up to leave) You're fantastic! (They meet up with Kramer and George on the way out) Hey guys!
What are you all out of breath from?
Actually, we met in the gym locker room.
Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?
(imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape?
She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?
(Shrugs) Oops. (Continues walking along the route, whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street, then keeps walking)
So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?
Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.
(to Elaine) Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?
TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.
(looking at the TV) Look at the picture on this thing...
Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they want
(Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?
If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.
That?s what I?ll do, I?ll just call him and tell him, I?ll tell him. That?s all I?ll do. He's a human being, I?ll talk to him. He'll understand. Right?
No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.
What do I say if he picks up?
Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...
There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?
Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.
(acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?
Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!
I don't know  he's got some valuable antiques, He's worried they'll break something.
Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts, so he killed him.
Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.)
Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, whats going on?
He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.
Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!
No, Elaines got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and hes suppose to do it.
All right. You know this girl Clare I am seeing?
So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouth-to-mouth.
Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.
You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.
"Hey, by the way, did you ever call that guy from the health club.?"
Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?
Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.
Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers?
Oh. (chuckles) Really? You don't seem that desperate.
He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.
Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!
Got 'em on the street, from a scal... (catches himself again)
You know what the odds are on a crash it's a million to one.
To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in, in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in "morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? fine" Ten minutes later you see him in the hall, "How ya doin'?" Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow "Hey" You start coming up with nicknames for them. "Jimbo."
I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.
He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught.
Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes.
everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah?
Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)
Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isnt that child abuse?
Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out.
Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?
If my father was moving this hed had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (as his father) 'Have you got your end?...Your ends got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your ends got to come down.'
(derisively at Kramer) Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?
Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.
Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.
Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing and
Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?
Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.
I cant believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.
What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at work?!?
Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses... I need an awkward pause.
I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?
Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.) You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?
I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat)
No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.
To a guy you've never met? (mild sarcasm) Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous.
Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later.
Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George.
My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.
Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?
You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?
All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier. (Elaine drinks straight out of the orange juice container) Hey.
I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.
(disoriented) How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?
Its very good cantaloupe. (Kramer leaves; to George) So thats it? Youre out?
No, shes a little too cheery for me.
How long did you leave it up there?
I would like to propose a toast....Wait a second.. George! George Costanza come in here.
Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen.
What's even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics.
(Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical..
(pause) If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?
Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.
I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.
20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.
It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.
Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?
I think that would be a very nice gesture.
This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.
Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and put it in.
I'm not a foodie. I don't, "Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty." Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book. What is this? The story of the bill? "Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.." What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating from the restaurant? What is this about?
Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat!
So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.
I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.
Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. (Joel shakes his head agreeing; Jerry smiles) You know, its their annual terrorist luncheon.
No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.
Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!
No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.
Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, (has his one hand up and his other hand down) he was down. Now he's up, (switches the positioning of his hands) you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.
They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.
Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.
Hmm. So you feel "women and children first," in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.
Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
I dont know how Im going to tell him.
(thinking) Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?
You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.
I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.
I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special treatment.
Krame? Sein. What are you doing? Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island. What are your thoughts about taking a ride? You sure? Okay, but don't leave me hanging here. Okay, great. Let me give you directions.
No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.
Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to fancy restaurants. (takes a sip of water)
How would you describe the smell in this house?
You know, if your future was a little more certain..
Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.
(impatient) Gone! (starts maniacally laughing) (briefly stops to point and explain) That bumper sticker.
Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?
Thats different. I didnt have feelings for those people. But you, youll backslide
(referring to George's outfit) And what mood is this.
You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there.
(sits on the back of the couch) Oh my god.
Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.
No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.
Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.
(to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)
So you were with him that day at the track?
Oh, did you get that outta my bag?
No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off.
Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.
Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place.
You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.
Why would I leave? This is my apartment.
(stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored)
Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...
Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?
You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!
(examining the label) Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.
I was. But, shes got me, like, hypnotized.
I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.
What? (to George) What did, what did you say?
What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what they're saying.
I don't know. (takes off his sweater) This sweater really itches me. You want it?
If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. Hes always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess its because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.
No, we don't care, we just want to go.
You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.
What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?
I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)
See you later. (to Elaine) Well we cant all be dating podiatrists. (Elaine laughs)
Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?
Oh my god, you're kidding. (dives for his wallet) Hang on a second. (reading from his registration) It's JVN 728.
Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.
Should I get it? I hate these moments. Im hearing the dual voices now, you know, What about the money? Whats money?
George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods)
Oh. No. What, you mean because of the "Chang"?
Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?
I sure do miss my apartment. Maybe I'll switch back.
Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?
This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually do it)
I don't know. I just feel he should call me.
I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?
No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.
You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.
He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket books. Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.
Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.
Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.
Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!
Oh! Come on, you told them you're from out-of-town just so you could stay in a hotel room.
I know it's a big problem.. she puts like four pieces in her mouth, it's ridiculous, I don't think we're gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.
(to the Barneys sales associate) Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?
I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.
Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.
If I told you, you woulda given it away.
No, don't stop, Kramer. Keep going, don't let him get away.
(trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.
STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this? Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.
You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this jockey and the jockey got off the horse and started chasin' him.
You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.
Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.
Kramer you're going to have to face her some time
Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.
Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person.
Oh, that guy was your cousin! (walking in front of George so he gets the picture to leave)
uh uh because then it would be all grown up.
I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it.
I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.
Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' "Where's your jock strap?" Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.
Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?
Golden Boys always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry. Here... touch Golden Boy!
Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?
But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.
That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?
(Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the 80s, and its still relatable today.
Alright. (Approaches host) Excuse me, this is your party, right?
Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.
No, but he's not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR)
You know you're not supposed to drink while you're keeping a secret! (Elaine laughs) Is there anything else?
Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?
How did you lock your keys in the car?
SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya! (the inter- com buzzes) Yeah?
(determined) I wanna join. I need it to become a member.
Alright, Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.)
Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. Im sure theyd just as soon give it to you, but youd have to come up with that money.
Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this? (moves his arm) He's gonna think you're a mental patient.
I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?
Hey come on, you're getting it all over the floor!
Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered? (Sees the pac) What happened?
Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.
...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.
Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises?
Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.
(as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.
Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this.
It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a "Tada!" gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say "I'll see ya.", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)
No, look, you don't understand. I, I want the picture.
I didnt know. Kramer told me about the worlds.
Yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder)
I kinda like this opera crowd, I feel tough... Anybody else got a problem?
Who figures and immigrants gonna have a pony?
Well you know what this means, don't you?
No. We both just saw the same monkey.
(to the Drake) Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye...
Alright! (picks up the phone and dials) Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. You know, you got a great 'John Houseman' name. Alec Berg. Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg?
I can't believe she threw out my napkin.
Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?
Of course I can, am I being funny now?
It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it.
Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there.
Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.
Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?
(He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.
Oh, I cant begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.
Go look at your face in the mirror.
Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.
(Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.
Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?
Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drakes coffee cake
Yeah, I blamed it on you. Hi Tim.
Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?
Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship.
I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. (Picks up the phone and dials.)
What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog.
I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work.
And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.
"Naaaaaa...I can't watch a man sing a song."
But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?
Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?
So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building?
I don't know what to tell you, Elton.
Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand.
Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!
Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?
I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody up.
Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.
Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, that's it. They go to the next show.
You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem.
(taking off his jacket) Slaughtered. Wiped the floor with 'em and (hanging up jacket) not only that, the money was unbelievable.
Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.
I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high.
But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.
(to George) So did you bring the lease? (George takes the lease from his inside pocket and hands it to Jerry.) All right, gee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time.
Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.
Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.
Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)
Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) "Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."
I dont know. He said hed call back.
(to the phone) Hello? (disappointed) Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) No. Uh, I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesnt know anything. Hes just my next-door neighbor. Uh, nothing much... Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. Im meeting somebody... Uh, Wednesday? Wednesdays okay... All right. Uh, Im a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning?... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone.
Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?!
Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.
So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister...
Yeah, but why would you... (Kramer is eating a peach then disgusted he spits it out) Bad peach?
(annoyed) All right. (after a pause) Hey, you know what's weird?
Where did I take it? Where Did I Take It? (stabbing a knife into a cutting board) Umm, to that place on, uh Columbus and 85th. Okay?
When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.
Leo's furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at George's book) What is that doing on the table?
Im getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other line beeps) Im getting another call, see ya(answers call) Hello!
Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.
So, are you gonna go out with her?
Now we have to buy a new couch?!
Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.
Hey Seth. Man it is coming down hard out there.
Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What drives me to take chances like that?
Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.
I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand.
I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation.
No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.
You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.
Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?
Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.
Oh, big fighting marlin. (Jerry acts like he is catching a marlin)
(pointing toward the guy) See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.
Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this, now she's got nothing.
The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.
What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one.
I'll tell you, that There for you crap was a stroke of genius.
(Kramer waddling out the door) Maybe you can soak in the tub.
Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you.
Oooh! I got a pain in my side.
Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?
Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.
This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.
Oh, Im sorry. Im just waiting for someone.
All right now you listen and you listen good! (he grabs Kramer's legs and throws him down the couch)
(TO GEORGE) Hey George, you ever see one?
[mockingly] "Please hurry". Look at you. Look at what you've become.
I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.
Alright, I'll change my shoes. (Heads back to his apartment. George follows.)
What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead.
You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.
Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.
Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.
Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. (Hands over Kramer's quilt.)
Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.
Why can't I buy my father a car?
What, your sad little horsies, the house with the little curl of smoke, the sunflower with the smiley face. the transparent cube... (as she leaves)
I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.
Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?
Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut.
Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 1130.
I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright*, I forgive you...
That's not going to be good for anybody.
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman anything you say she does!
Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting a package.
Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.
I love these nature shows, Ill watch and kind of nature show, and its amazing how you can always relate, to whatever theyre talking about. You know like youre watching the African Dung Beetle and youre going Boy, his life is a lot like mine. And you always root for whichever animal is the star of the show that week -- like if its the antelope, and theres a lion chasing the antelope you go, Run antelope Run! Use your Speed, Get away! But the next week its the lion, and then you go Get the antelope, eat him, bite his head! -- Trap him, dont let him use his speed!
Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?
Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.
It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.
I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight.
Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.
Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.
All right, go, it's a race! Come on!
I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect.
Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally!
The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal.
Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?
Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. (George laughs) So, when do you move into the apartment?
I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and Ill just make up some excuse why I cant go to the game either.
Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.
Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.
All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!
It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?
(To himself) Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. (George doesn't react) What's the matter?
Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!
Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus.
I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" thing.
That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this, okay...
I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?!
Look, let me just give you the forty, plus another twenty for your trouble.
So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything?
(in a tuxedo) So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a woman that won't have sex with you.
Seth! Wow what has it been like five years?
It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!
They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What do they look like."
You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?
No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.
Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.)
Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.
Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.
(Reads the pill bottle) What kind of pills are these, anyways?! "For Smuckers"? "May cause panting and loss of fur"? (Turns to Kramer) These are dog pills!
Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?
You spent the night at James's? Did we?
I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.
Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people?
So what do you have to say for yourself?
(he hits a few keys and looks over at her) Cash advance... yes (hits a key)  no (he looks over again) balance inquiry... no (he looks again) receipt.... no (he looks again) processing... processing... (He opens the box, pulls out his money and then looks at the woman and says) I won!
So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?
He asked you to watch them not wear them.
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.
(To George) You're givin' him back that TV.
Hey, is that my maple syrup? Oh, ya. (Kramer hands it over.)
I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.
Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.
Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.
Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.
(picks up the phone on the coffee table) 555-3455. Well wait a second, don't you see that's 555-FILK.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.
Well, I just want you to know I'm there for you. Course now I'm here for you, but when i'm not here for you, i'm there for you.
(looking at the cop) What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think he's getting coffee.!
I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.
No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!
Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?
Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.
I'm not letting you cheat, Newman. You're not getting anywhere near that board.
So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the Spokes model category?
Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't do you favors after you dump them.
Doesnt think anyone can tell. So cmon, do we have a deal?
Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?
Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?
It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do.
Let me see that. (Jerry looks at the tag.) That is high.
Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you.
I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.
I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?
Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?
I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.
Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?
See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.
Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in big, big trouble.
Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be.
Good question. (More to himself than to Elaine) Why are we calling?
Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.)
Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, George Louis Costanza. Here I am about to go to the electric chair and my oldest friend is dating the governor
Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the etiquette?
No, I think the head does most of the stretching.
So what did you do there all day?
.. and uh, underwear and a tee shirt.
You faked it? Why would you do that?
Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?
No, go ahead, I second-hand smoke two packs a day.
You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.
Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.
I'm saying "get the hell outta there"! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call, Jean-Paul! A wake-up call!
I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.
Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.
For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.
(animated) You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about.
You should have her work on it for you.
There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing.
(Nervous laughter) Yeah.. like a pirate.. (Attempting to get on another subject) Anyway, ah, you know, we're hoping to, um, raise enough money.. with this.. uh..
The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go "Excuse me, I think you missed a spot."
You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.
Alright, but let me ask you this question.
All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.
Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.
Yes. I do. You show me where there's a can opener in that drawer. (Answers the phone.) Hello! I'm sorry, I'm just fighting with my wife.
Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.
So how did you leave it with him?
(Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..
Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.
People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression 'The best revenge is living well' I've said this, in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice, doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him, 'Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting, french doors, a divan. That'll show those punks.'
Hes a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.
Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...
Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.
The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.
I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'?
Yeah. Im having a wonderful time. (it's obvious he isn't)
Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.
All right. (goes into his hallway and comes back) You got my fins?
How would you know? You don't speak Korean.
Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone? You wanted the machine. You know, and you're always kind of thrown off, (left hand up to side of face, pretending its a receiver) you go "Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you."
(Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.
Why don't you go out? It's nice out.
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little...
A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?
I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?
Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.
W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?
You wanna go with me up to (clap) the Bronx and see if there's any flyers on George's car.
Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.
I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodations. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats.
(Fed up) Alright! Excuse me! (Gets up) I'm not buying any of this!
The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.
All right. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle Arbys no more than once a month. And in exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game, and doesnt read a book.
Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.
Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one.
Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman...
"So what about the Penthouse. Did you ask him?"
But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.
See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'.
Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...
(nodding awkwardly for a moment) All right, I think we're done here. (Jerry leaves and Phil shuts the door darkly)
So he just gets soup. He wants to save the meal. So now I got to do it all over again.
A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning..
Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land.
(Joking around) Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.
We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy.
(Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!
Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.
No, no I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like the title and insisted that he change it to "War and Peace"!
Sure, its like robbing a bank. You dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.
Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?
Fluff and Fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.
Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!
How can I ever have you over? Youll sit there moping.
No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.
You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.
Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?
What causes homophobia? What is it, that makes a heterosexual man, worry? I think it's because, men know, that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, "Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'"
Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full.
The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. "Who was that clown?", "I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?", "The guy's a clown!". How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, "What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!"
I dont really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because theres that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, youre sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, Im really sorry about this. I dont know why I left that stuff over there. And thats why I could never be a maid, because Id have an attitude. Id find them, wherever they are in the house, Oh, I suppose you couldnt do this? No, dont get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldnt dust. No, this is too tough, isnt it?
I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.
Oh, I get it, this is about the button.
(indicating the woman) Game, set and match, huh Milos?
So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.
Nope, the cop says its my word against his. Theres nothing they can do.
Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't get any oxygen.
We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men.
No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.
I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)
What are you doing? Were going out for dinner in ten minutes.
More Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I don't even have any wood in the house!
Well, this is it. I'm really gonna do something about my life, you know? You know, I think I'm gonna call Melanie again. So what if she shushed me. GEORGE, I am really gonna make some changes.
well aside from that from that, how did he like the sandwiches?
What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?
Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read.
Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.
Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.
I asked. Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian football.
August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress! She never changes! Oh my god. (looking around) She's gotta have hundreds of these dresses.
Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.
Why do I have to go on the tour?
I have no patience for lactose. And I wont stand for it. Um, Ill be right back.
Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.
(bewildered) Why would she try and kill you?
You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.
Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.
Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)
So George, how do I beat this lie detector?
What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?
Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?
They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing."
Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen?
(Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?
No. The police have no leads (sitting on the couch arm) and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.
Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'
No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking.
Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.
Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)
So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?
No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything off me, first laughs now ladies.
The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.
I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?
Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here...
(To Elaine) Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get some coffee.
I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, "This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here."
(seeing Fredo's tombstone) Oh, my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up! (hands the shovel to Kramer)
Good luck, It's sold out for the next three weeks.
So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.
You know 'm just curious, How did you know she wasn't my girlfriend?
Excuse me, uh...dentist? You a dentist? (The guy shakes his head. Jerry moves on to another guy.) Dentist? Are you a dentist?
I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.
So you just did the opposite of everything?
Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.
I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?
Look I really don't know what they're plans are.
Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again? (listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone. C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me. (hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello.
You guys both have class at the same time?
(To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!
No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!
That's what a gym teacher once told me.
(Pointing) But are you still master of your domain?
What could possess anyone to throw a party? I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.
And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?
Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.
(Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!
In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?
Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.
You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?
(His thoughts) I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver.
Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" or, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" You emphasize "Jerry" or "bring."
Im supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?
So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing?
Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.
I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.
Oh, no don't say that. You'll jinx me.
(In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so.
(to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?
Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's better than eating it.
Hum, well it all comes as news to me.
That was Elaine , she changed her mind. She's not coming over.
Hey, look, there's Bobby Eighteen?s father-in-law, Mr Reichman. George and I were just talking about that today, I can?t believe it! That?s the guy who threw George out of the wedding.
Dont worry about it, it wasnt working anyway.
Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.
Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, Im in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants.
These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin' to make that call! (George comes in)
You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... (he spots a mailman crouched emptying a box) Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.
What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What are you Peter Lorre?
Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.
Who was in town on a business venture, and um..
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?
So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh?
(Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My, isn't this an awkward moment?
No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy.
I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?
(gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!
It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.
And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!
Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired.
Kramer, do you realize what's going on here? Do you know why you're here?
Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?
Just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces Kramer) Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!
Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour.
So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?
Turn up the heat in your apartment! (opens a window)
Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
(Reading it) "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." - What is that?
You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?
(Disgusted. To the woman) Oh, come on. You know he's a postman, don't ya?
Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.
What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.
(for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.
When's he leaving? (putting some items into the refrigerator)
(to George) You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! It's crazy Joe Devola.
Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.
tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.
Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.
Whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guyll be like, I dont think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life? And of course the womans looking at the guy, thinking, What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?
Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to give it up.
(Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing?
(As George sits down) George, we need to talk.
Dont do the apples. Its enough already with the apples.
I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back.
Yeah, but how could you be so sure?
I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life.
Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it?
When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.
It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.
Well yes I did that's true. A couple of a guys I knew in the coastguard told me about her.... and I sensed that she had the anger and intensity that I needed to make this film work.
I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)
And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.
Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.
Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--
Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!
Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.
Aaa. Well ... you want something to eat, don't you?
Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--
Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.
Alright, alright. Uh, undo them. I'll help you get them off.
Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?
Were you crying? I mean, its just a grape. Youll find it.
(as Kramer walks by) You're a master of race relations.
Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.
Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.
But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?
Hello, oh hi Duncan, 400 o'clock tomorrow? That is not going to work. . . . Why? I'll tell you why. Because I chose not to run!
She might be. She's the star of the show.
"Hey! Hey! Watch it.!... You're drooling all over the floor. How much Novocaine did that guy give you."
Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.
(to George) Snow. Snow, that cant be good for suede, can it?
You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?
The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.
She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing.
oh.. uh.. you know your breath is a little garlicky you better take some gum.
Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why dont you just settle it like mature adults?
Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?
Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.
I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend.
Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way.
Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..
So know every time you get dressed. You are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer.
Here you go. (Poppie stands up and takes the money.) Anyway, I'm sorry again about the...(notices a large, wet stain on his couch)...the...the...
That voice. That voice. Shes driving me crazy.
So I dont know what shes using it for.
Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.
(stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem?
So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?
Sex... to save the friendship. (Elaine drops her bag, takes off her jacket and walks into Jerry's bedroom) Well, if we have to (un-tucks his shirt) we have to.
Well my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.
Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?
(answering machine) Leave a message. I'll call you back. Thanks.
I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.
Since when are you treating me to medicine? What are you doing? You're stealing this, aren't you?
Coincidence? This guys in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment?
I dont know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I cant decide.
I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.
Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. >click click click<...
You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.
Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them.
Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?
(defensive) At least it was just the handle!
I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.
why don't you just break it off with her. tell her it's over
I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.
(to George) Is that uh, other apartment still available?
Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerrys office. (Elaine is looking confused). Were going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean hes already left?
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why dont you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin anything?
I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home.
She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?
Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio.
Well, once I didnt have dinner until, like 900 oclock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage  meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya? Throw out my garbage for me.
Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.
Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,
Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
Yeah. Specifically 930 shows. Seen any good 930 shows at the Paragon, Willie?
Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know, we can't go anywhere near there.
What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.
Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.
I like your nails, that is a great color.
I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...
I think we might have one left in the stock room.
You know what? That was the amazing thing.
He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. He's a time slot hit.
The way I feel when I go places with you? (Kramer enters.) Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?
You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?
well, you know, sometimes a square is everything
Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding.
No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.
Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.
I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?
Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.
So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new guy, in a big pot of love stew.
Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you.
(looking at Kramer's moustache) Uh, we're not doing that anymore.
What is this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesnt fit him).
(turning to Kramer) That's nice for the freaks.
I was out in the snow last night.
Oh, Hey, there's a name you don't forget.
Well, we need change and all I have is twenties.
Nothing. I'm sure "Jon" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! (Laughs uproariously.)
George, I didnt sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. Im just going to be honest. Thats all... Yes, Im nervous... Are you listening to me?... Just put some soap on your finger. Itll slide right off... Then try axle grease... (Kramer enters; to the phone) Ill call you back after I talk to her... Bye.
See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey George, look, I'm not funny now.
Naw, I gotta wait until its just the right time.
By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks.
[with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?!
I wonder where Elaine is sitting? I really wanted you to meet her she's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend Tony
How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?
Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.
I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.
Lean your head back. Open your mouth! (Grabs Kramer's head) Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!
I want this baby fully loaded. (listens) Well, how soon can you get it there? (listens) Oh, that's terrific. (listens) Okay, thanks, bye.
Hey, it's one thing if I asked you "Could you do me a favor?" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE (Obviously up to something. Jerry doesn't suspect anything - yet) Whey you told me what you went through on the plane, it makes you stop and think. You appreciate having a real friend.
Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.
Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.
I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..
You raise the feet, get blood to the head.
Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?
I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.
What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them.
You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.
Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine.
Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad.
He left me there. You see the mind games?
You, sidle? Y-You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!
Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer. It shows at least he's making an effort.
Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.
Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.
Yeah. You know, kind of a peace offering. Cute.
I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?
Yeah, I took her home one night  we kinda started up a little bit in the car.
Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.
(pulling out a tape from his pocket) Vvvvup. Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your feet up?
Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.
Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.
Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set.
How many years of med school did you have?
Oh, no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down. (George & Jerry each slide to the end of their booth seats)
In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.
I don't think so. Why would I do that?
This thing has never worked right. (holding the machine in his hand)
That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?
I mean, if were gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.
How's life on the red planet? (shuts door)
Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So...
Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.
I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce you get impeached and you're not even the president!
Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage from her yet!
You're going out with the stationery store guy?
Well, I didnt uh really mean a pony, per se...
"They get all emotional , they sway. It's embarrassing."
What was I supposed to do? You knew I was on my first date with Elaine. You come barging in here asking me to contribute money for a volcano relief fund for krakatoa.
So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was just wondering if there were houses there to rent.
All fathers are intimidating. Theyre intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, To hell with the world, I can make my own people. Ill eat whatever I want, Ill wear whatever I want, and Ill create whoever I want.
You are the Queen of Confrontation. Youre my new hero. In fact, youve inspired me. Im gonna call George about something right now.
Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!
(Fishing for his keys in a kitchen drawer) You know, when I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time.
I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.
Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex.
No!!! The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him, you break his spirit!
Um, you know, its the damnedest thing. It went away.
George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality.
Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying "mickey"!
She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.
I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction.
Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?
I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?
Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened. (listens) Well, I think you should. Okay, bye.
Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.
I dont think so. You know they, theyre so fragile.
Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town.
The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?
(tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back) Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.
I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, "Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me." But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?
The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?
Oh, its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.
I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.
What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?
Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.
It's been three days and he hasn't called.
Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day.
Oh No, wait a second... Wait a second... I-I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name.
You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.
Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
It's been known to happen....... telling you right now Elaine, this guy 's gonna dangle that dress in front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule.
No, its not that. It wasnt all one-sided.
I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me "C'mon Jerry, go along, go along..."
You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola!
I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
(hitting metal with the first strike of the shovel) Well, that was easy.
All right, I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else.
Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'
Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact with --
Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?
Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman.
I just wanted to say how sorry I was...
So are you gonna get him a chair?
Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?
Hey, not bad. (pointing to crest) I kinda like this little thing here.
Im worried I wont be able to talk to him. Hes such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.
I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.
Im gonna make an appointment for you. Well go together.
Yeah, its some place down in the village.
No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.
Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what youre talking about, now, come on, come with me. (stands up) I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.
Oh, no, no, no, wait a second, wait a second th-th-that--
Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.
All right, all right. (trying on the suit jacket)
Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?
You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.
Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet?
Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!
Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.
Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip.
(Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat.
Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too.
I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.
Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?
It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.
Oh my god! Look what's goin' on here! She is depraved! (Grabs a towel and brings it to Lena.) There you are.
You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.
Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, they'll believe us.
I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes.
Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.]
(thinking) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume...
Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors.
I'll tell you what happened. We got married.
I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
(aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!
I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it.
I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I? (throws coat over his right shoulder)
All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? (sits opposite George)
How do you like that? (tries to turn away again; thinking)Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I cant, I cant. Im stuck.
Oh, really. (Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.)
When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.
Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much. (To Kramer) I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!
Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?
Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.
I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?
I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.
Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. (opens the fridge and gets a bottle of water.)
I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. Shes going to move in.
I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.
Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for show.
And who were you tryin to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?
Gina, do you know what a Drakes Coffee Cake is?
You're not a little anything, Newman. So just pack it up and move it out of here.
Yes, but lets just stop it right there.
Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.
(sound of gunfire) Pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, Pkeeew!
(back in booth) He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life.
Well, if I hear an anguished "oink", I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look (HE POINTS AT PASSERBY) Human, human, human... (HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR, WITH ALARM.) (WITH MOCK ALARM) Wait a second! (Grabs Kramer)
(Once again, the audience hears his thoughts) I'm so car sick. I'm gonna vomit!
Do you know what this is all about? Do you know, why were here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about We should go out? This is what theyre talking about...this whole thing, were all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, were all out! There are people tryin to find us, they dont know where we are. (on an imaginary phone) Did you ring?, I cant find him. Where did he go? He didnt tell me where he was going. He must have gone out. You wanna go out you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...Then youre standing around, whatta you do? You go We gotta be getting back. Once youre out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, its my feeling, youve gotta go.
What would you say if I told you that...
What do you mean not going? why not?
I can't go until I find my cufflinks.
(yelling) Yes I told him the Packyderm story!
What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.
Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?
I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life.
You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go 'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.'
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. ! Celebrate! How about some champagne?
Now, I should tell you that, at this point, she's under the impression that youre - a - ah
(on the phone) Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.
Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!
(going through couch cushions) Where the hell did I put this?
Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.
Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.
Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with you?
My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?
Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.
It's this one here in the back. (Tilts his head back, and knocks Elaine's trophy out the window. A loud hissing sound and commotion is heard from the street below. Everyone runs to the windows to look.)
Latex? And what do I do with latex?
Oh yeah? I dont believe youve seen... this.
(disbelief) So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?!
That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
No, really, I just got off the phone with him.
You know, I don't even know my IQ.
Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?
All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape.
That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?
Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?
Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?
--but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is inadvertently sent an insurance--
Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to an open box) isn't that one of yours?
Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?
It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
Youre gonna get back together, anyway. Its thousands of dollars!
I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.
Yeah, killed. Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark.
I have an idea. (Elaine enters; to Elaine) We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three.
Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida.
She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
(Like a little kid) But, I don't want to be a pirate!
We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing.
Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model.
Oh, great! Alright. (We hear the announcers calling the game.)
Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.
"Jimmy's got a record. Jimmy's jumping for dollars. Jimmt and George are gonna get rich."
Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer.
Hold it. Broccoli? Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce.
Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar!
Well, good night [holds hand out and shakes hand]
I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?
All right, but you have to go now.
You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me. He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back.. I'm putting this guy ....RIGHT OUT OF COMMISSION....
What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty minutes of 'So, who's from out of town?'
George what the hell are you doing over there? I told you to mind your own business now stay out of my affairs!
Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted.
Look Ramon, about the other day. Im sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway.
..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye. HA Ha..Who do these women think they're dealing with? Did she think she was gonna leave this incredibly erotic message on my tape and I was just gonna let it go. Not Bloody likely...
(Resisting) Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I-I can't wear this!
Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!
Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?
(Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not.
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.
I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it.
All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, "It's been real," move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.
Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it.
Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.
How much was it to clean the vest?
But your were an executive, this is fast food.
Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me...
No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.
Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago.
Ugh, the four worst words in the English language.
(to the phone) Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my moneys gone... Well, call me right back. (Jerry hangs up.) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasnt been home or in his office in the past three days!
(on the phone) Hello? No, Im sorry Bania ... Im not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye.
Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!
Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?
Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly.
Oh. like they wouldn't have found that anyway.
Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.
Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!
Yeah, thats good. Hed clunk our heads together like Moe.
I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.
To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.
Got it. (but now a man-hand grabs his arm) Uh!
Excuse me. (Gets up and answers the door.) Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!
Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, You think?
Of course he did ..The guy's working ya.
I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.
No, "yada yada" is good. She's very succinct.
I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...
(turning to each other) I dont know. Hes an importer.
Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off.
And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?
No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 1030.
I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.
I mean all that stuff is so small.. ((ELAINE is wryly assessing him)) stupid..
(bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.
Come on. Something's on your mind. Out with it.
After one date you try and improvise on her machine?
Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business.
First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did.
He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV.
Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.
I don't even know if I remember the number.
Really? How come you never pursued her before?
A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.
All right, the whole elevator business, let me just explain-
Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a men's room. That's the end of that.
Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.
Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off.
Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?
Is that like the end of the world or something?
(Interrupts) Excuse me...Excuse me... Are you asking him out ?
I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it.
Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)
I don't know , Who keeps track of Hellos.
Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.
I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.
Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant? Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it in there by helicopter, you know keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. "We got the hair but I think we lost the Zest." ....rejects the transplant with organs. Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . Guy just standin' there and suddenly... ..Bink! ( motions hair flying out of his head)........lands in someone's frozen yogurt.
Im always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice. Never quite sure, Is this the best lane for me? For my life? Theyre always a little bit ahead of you, Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there? Yeah, come on over here, pal. Were zoomin over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it. The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen? Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday well be going, (Jerry pretends hes driving in reverse.) Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. Im gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.
I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.
Hello? Yeah he's here. (to Kramer) Hey! It's for you.
What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. (Hangs up)
Of course not, if I did would you have gone?
Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?
I think that's a "what's good for the goose is good for the gander".
Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.
Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,
I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.
Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.
So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.
The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.
(stopping them) We better not. (they make out some more; then stop) T-They're gonna be here any second.
Yeah , she's coming to see my act tonight.
Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.
Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, "This is good, who is this? I like this person". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, (pretending to wake up) "Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!"
I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment for two days. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my parents. they'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own I'm sure it's gonna be some awful dump. Wait a second.. Have you checked in The Plaza yet?
Well, uh, I uh, I dont want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe its not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.
How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go.
Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.
(Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!
Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.
Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over this whole operation!
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal, (steer).
(to George) No. (to Kramer) I told you not to say anything.
Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
(singing) Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home.
Ma! Ma! MAAA! (Hangs up the phone in disgust.) Oh, ahhhh (sighs quietly)
Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.
And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
Hey buddy. I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's like in there, all night long things are creaking and cracking. And that red light is burning my brain!
Of course I was getting you a note.
It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---
Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?
(thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.
I thought youre like Hitler in the bunker?
I don't have any change. You've got any change?
(looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
(Trying to read the note) What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit.
Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
So youre saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, its all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.
No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.
Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.
If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber.
I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.
It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.
What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!
How much did you wound up tipping her?
I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.
Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.
Oh, no. I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with it.
Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up?
All I said was I liked the pen!
Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?
(Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What?
I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.
Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...
Well you should hear the message from my nut. Where's George and Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, I feel very vulnerable.
You can't go to China What about your job?
(Scolding) George. (To salesman) Sorry, were just waiting for David Puddy.
Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--
I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.
Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.
I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.
Oh no, where's the blood? (opens the fridge) It's in here isn't it?
I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for him for a second.
Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.
Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because moneys a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you dont care about money when youre hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, youre like the ruler of an empire. More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives. Then after the meal, you know, youve got the pants open, youve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. Theyre mystified by the check. What is this? How could this be? They start passing it around the table, Does this look right to you? Were not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?
Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.
He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in.
So you're not gonna come back to New York with us?
Okay. I'll get it. (Goes into the bedroom.)
And you want to be my latex salesman.
Im not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. Ive decided Ill do the work. Im gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? Cause you send your money out there  working for you  a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me. Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.
I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!
I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.
Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?
(Arms out, complaining) I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!
Is that guy still there? (They are side-on to Phil who is in the background, still pressed against the glass, aghast)
What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?
You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!
She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.
Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.
How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? Wha, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just sit there going, "Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh, no, another headcase!"
Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...
(still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?
Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you?
He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?
(opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.
You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?
Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him.
(sarcastically) Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.
Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it.
I think the thing I admire most about the Chinese is that they're hanging in there with the chopsticks. Because, if you think about it, you know, they've seen the fork... by now. I'm sure they've seen the spoon, they're going, "Yeah, yeah, they're OK... We're going to stay with the sticks." I mean, I don't know how they've missed it, thousands of years ago, Chinese farmer gets up, has his breakfast with the chopsticks, goes out and works all day in the field with a shovel... Hello?... Shovel! Not going out there ploughing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues.
Yeah, so Joey?s a great lover of the opera
Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.
Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.
Happy camper , I don't hear that expression enough.
No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.
Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???
Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?
What are you talking about? It's my car. Let me pay for the gas.
No, gore-tex. It's new. (Checks his pockets.) Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that.
I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there.
Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.
I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble. I'll do it myself.
I think he's the same age as the father.
No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.
The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves)
You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.
Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's uh yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it?
Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?
(into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!
All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.
Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you (throws the bottle to Kramer.)
How could I know she would start to laugh?
Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?
(CONT'D) You want me to help you with that?
Can't you at least die with a little dignity?
Widower? Wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research)
Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?
Plus Im wearing short sleeves, I dont want to expose my tattoos. (Vanessa smiles; thinking) Shes unbelievable!
(to George) I mean, come on. (a thought occurs) No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from *Seals and Croft*.
Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there.
What do you think? It's like a poker game?
Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?
First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.
You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?
(in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.
Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.
NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.
Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.
Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!
Could you make a little more noise? (To his parents) Listen, I'm gonna have to call you later.
She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.
Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?
He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. (Mimics brushing his teeth) Away from the gums... (The door opens a little, George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and Elaine, then enters.)
You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.
You asked a date to go to the operation?
All right, bye. (to Elaine) You see this? Any thought pops into their head they're calling me because it's a local call now.
Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.
Oh no! >click click< Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!
You did not tell me not to sell.
(flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb.
Great talkin' to you. (Nina leaves. To himself) What the hell is e-mail?
Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?
Nah, I dont go for these non-refundable deals. I cant commit to a woman. Im not going to commit to an airline.
(trying to ease the tension) Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends.
H... G... F. Seat four. One, two, three... f-- Hello Newman.
Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.
The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
How could you leave a message like that on my machine.?
Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.
Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.
Hey. Why didn't cha get the big one?
In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
Although what if its one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?
Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.
No, no, no. I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.
(a little confused) You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables?
Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. (And to George) What do you mean you can't tell me?
...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.
Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)
Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?
"No ,Elaine and I we're just discussing whether I could admit a man is attractive."
Oh, they're all the same. Here. [gives him Dust Buster] Now if you'll excuse us, ..
So what are you going to do with the mattress?
Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.
Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just wanted to pick it up.
Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?
I can't figure out what's going on here. I can't follow the plot. Why did they kill that guy? I thought he was with them?
Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?
No, believe me it's not good. I'll mail you a new one with something really funny written on it.
No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.
Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.
Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?
Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?
Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it.
Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.
Good idea. (phone's ringing, goes to it) (muttering) There's a beach towel on the rack.. (to phone) Yeah.
Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
Yea, ya, so...anyway what was I talking about.
Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it.
Oh, Im sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.
Well. (calling down the hall) Call if you're gonna be late!
I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...
This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!
You know I dont get that whole suicide machine. Theres no tall buildings where these people live? They cant wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?
And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.
Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.
George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!
I'll see you later. (he leaves with unseemly haste)
George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.
I would like to know what my names doin in this creep's organizer to begin with.
Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.
You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.
I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
(looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!
Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in your friend John Germaine's band there.
So then as I was getting out of the car, ...
He yells and you don't get your soup.
[quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!
What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like it?
That's it! No more questions! I don't care!
Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)
I'm sorry. Got any booze? What's say you and I get ripped!
(walking towards door with Elaine) How long did you last? (opens door)
Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.
Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.
I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. (Lena is puzzled.)
Alright, I'm gonna get this. This looks good.
(Nauseated at the saying) Would you please stop saying that?!
Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going "boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly."
(interrupting) "Elaine , I really don't...............pay much attention to men`s faces."
I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. Its like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you doing today?
She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?
(CONT'D) What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.
Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?
Ill have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot.
Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-
Your breath is fine. It's delightful, it's delicious.
I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals.
It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman.
You know I can't get this *damn thing* to sleep. (about the Yo-Yo)
So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.
Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?
I really think you're making too much of this.
Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.
No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.
I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.
Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.
(thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And Ive still got another day! Ive got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. (to Vanessa) Thats a nice watch. Do you wind it?
Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency.
Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.
(Joking about the bra-less wonder) Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.
Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad it's Klompus.
The wheels are in motion, things are happening!
Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.
Whats the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!
Youre already moping! Would you take the place?
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.
to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?
So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?
Yeah, and youre just what shes looking for too  a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.
Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.
Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners.
(Pulls a small bottle out of his pocket) Uh-huh. Hey, look what they had on the plane. Schnapps.
(sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there and I will.
Jim Fowler? The animal guy from "Wild Kingdom" is coming to your apartment?
Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time.
Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.
Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.
We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.
I dont return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.
Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him.
Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately.
I didnt open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.
I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck.
May I see you outside for a moment please?
Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.
I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all.
No you go on ahead, I'll take the bus.
Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses.
Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?
No no no, dont interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what its doing. Just let it finish.
Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.
(Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.
Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.
Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side.
(Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?
'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'.
Can you relax, its a cup of coffee. Claire is a professional waitress.
But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.
Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?
(Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing is now?? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!
Ah, here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) Mmm, delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some.
$40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.
Yes, so people are just dialing it by mistake and getting you.
Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time.
No you can't. (hangs up the phone) Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?
Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guys out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, its true, men hear a drill, its like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, Honey, I think Jims working on something over there. So they run over to the guy. Now they dont actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. Thats what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, What are you using, a Phillips-head? You know, we feel involved. Thats why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, thats just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they dont cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, thatll hold.
Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.
Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?
You see , I kept up my end of the pact.
So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian...
There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?
I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.
Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?
wait, where are you going? where are you going?
What's happening? What, you doing, come and talk to us.
Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!
You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?
I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? Thats what I want to know. I mean, its the championship, Im hitting everything.
OK, fine. 'What do I have to do to put you in this van today?'
Okay, you tell me. What is it worth?
Evry-Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. "Oh, is he good?" "Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best." They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, "You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. No, he's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher." And then there's always that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me." Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, "Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. And everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."
Well, thats it. Look, Im going to Vermont. I dont want to think about this. Im selling.
It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.
(taking a catalog) Can I have one? I need one of those old-looking phones. So you wanna grab a bite?
Flinched? I did not flinch. George, did I flinch?
Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.
So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?
Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years.
Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!
Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out?
I cant believe it! This guy ripped me off!
Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing.
I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife fight for a citrus drink.
No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.
Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? Theres Elastic Man... Plastic Man...
You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.
A few stitches? I've never had stitches. I'll be deformed. I can't live with that. It goes against my whole personality. It's not me!
Its a good mirror. (They look at their menus.) So, what are you gettin?
So Kramer, what are you going to do?
Kramer, they're fumigating. There's toxic gas in there.
You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!
Come on. Then you dont have to see him again til my 15,000-mile check.
Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.
Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress.
Anyway, you know why I didnt ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab.
All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! (Audience boos)
Would you excuse me a minute? Im gonna go to the bathroom. Ill be right back.
No, George was there, he said he had a great time.
I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
My whole night's ruined. I didn't do any sets, didn't do any movies...
Hey is the same thing as hello. What do you think Jeannie.
I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--
So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?
[rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your point!
I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.
No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.
(grimaces and takes the shovel back) I'll dig.
so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?
What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again.
It's not that bright orange one is it?
With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.
I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?
No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!
No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.
I got it! (snaps his fingers) We give the keys to Elaine.
We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.
Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I?
You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?
Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort?
All right, all right. All right, thats enough! Lets get back to my deal. That undercoating, thats a rip-off, isnt it, David?
(wiping his brow) He could use a couple laughs.
Fifty years they were married. Now hes moving to Pheonix.
What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must be something. What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks?
Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it.
But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.
Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated.
It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes the door) Give me that back.
(very disinterested) Hum... ok, what else you got?
Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt.
Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?
Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage.
Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer, say it isn't so.
(into phone) Hello Joe, listen this is Jerry Seinfeld, I really think there?s been a huge colossal misunderstanding,
(applying paste to brush) Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?
(Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!
..living together after a while we... we might start to get on each others nerves a little.
That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.
Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!
What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?
(to Kramer) Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot.
You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand?
So have your parents found out about it?
You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.
Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?
How much could you possibly have in there?
Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off that sign?
Technically, you're sauted. So, what are you doing for that?
So why didn't you tell her the code?
Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?
And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.
That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.
Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.
Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...
Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!
Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--
Who takes care of your boy during the day?
So, you would date a married guy? That's so hacky.
You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!
Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. Its completely shrunk. Theres absolutely no way I can wear it.
Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.
Yep. Since college. (Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.) Hey, Lena Small's on this list.
They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.
I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.
This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes) Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?
Kramer! (tries to hide he's upset and jealous)
Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?
Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.
No appointments at all? (motions to Elaine to move over)
Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks.
A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?
You know, I really... Ive come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that theyre just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you dont really wanna see them. You dont call them, they call you. You dont call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you dont really have anything in common with is to pretend youre hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend theres a little desk around you. The only problem with this is theres no way you can say, Hey, its been great having you on the show. Were out of time.
Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure there are many people who do not like me.
Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.
Uh, this is George. (reaches for her name) Im sorry...
Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you.
(Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here?
Great. One of the best jobs I ever had.
Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.
Ramon, what are you doing here? You could get in trouble.
I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!
Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.
Yknow, my parents are coming in for this...
Why don't you go to another nail shop?
(Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.
I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .
(to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?
And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.
You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.
There's no watch ... I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep good time. My parents gave it to me, but I didn't like it. So don't mention it again, okay!
(Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven!
Oh! but I do. There's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar. ( as he says this Newman is wildly scratching behind his back. he suddenly stops when Jerry turns around)
Alright, that's it.. (Grabs Kramer, trying to pull him out of the car)
Who do I know who would have even been in a limousine yesterday anyway. Uhh-O h-owow!
ALL RIGHT, COME ON UP (Jerry puts his head down - he's not looking forward to Kenny Bania)
Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down. (To Elaine) What?
Oh, man, look at this mess! You know what's gonna happen if they see this?
Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. (Faint) I don't care about that.
No, I don't wanna see the naked people.
No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car.
It's okayit's just a hot dog, (still sobbing) everything is going to be okay.
(Knocking on Kramer's door) Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey.
Well, her belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) Im bored. Talk to me.
No, no, no, another race - out of the question.
So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?
(writing) Here's my address and number. And really, thanks again.
Here he is... that's the guy! (rolls up window) No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!
I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are gonna be so sorry!
oh I'm sorry I didn't get most of that.. isn't that Kramer over there?
You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. And you can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. Then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin' Alright, gimme everything you have, too''.
Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him)
Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation.
Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?
Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.
Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number.
That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.
George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!
A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?
Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time.
The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off?
Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?
We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.
Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.
I don't need a personal trainer. (Kramer comes in) all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.
It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.
This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.
I don't get this. How did this happen. I don't have a dog.
You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand and put it on his shoulder)
That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.
Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll uh try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. (Goes into his room, and comes back out with the jacket on.) Ahh, haven't worn this one in a long time.
You gotta go to my chiropractor, hes the best.
No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time?
Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?
So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?
Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.
Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... (to himself, cursing her) Mulva!
Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something.
Course you may not see it for twenty years.
Super bowl! Hey, an original G.I. Joe. (picks up both items) With a full frogman suit.
You know, we never had one fight before this deal.
Uh, hang on a second, You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck.
What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?
Thats what you want to see, yeah. . . . Yeah, you want to trade your hair for some phlegm.
Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.
You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, "Hey, they like the soup! Keep it up!"?
(Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.
(getting worked up) I don't need the money.
I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!
Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.
No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.
No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing.
If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, Im telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. Im sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.
Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.
So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?
(placatory) Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me.
No, go ahead. Look at this place. I cant wait to get it cleaned.
The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.
Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined.
That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!
(after Bookman exits) That is one tough monkey! (turns to Elaine) So you were saying?
I cant. Im on my way out. Theres no way I can do it.
Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... Im sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if...
He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them
I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?
It had fat in it, it's not good for you.
(opens the door for George) Where did you get that?
So, where do you want to eat tonight?
Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?
Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.
They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.
Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we play one for all the marbles?
He went to get some steak sauce. Why?
You were livin' in the village then, right?
I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.
No, I actually find you quite charming. A bit verbose at times...
(tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggage, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangements, but we can't seem to be friends when we sleep together.
Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll never get another date with her. She'll freak out.
Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.
Let me explain something to you. You see, youre not normal. Youre a great guy, I love you, but youre a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldnt understand.
Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. Its the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... (Jerry pushes the door shut.) ...MUST BE CLOSED!!
What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?
I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race.
So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!
Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?
I said pull over by the stop sign.
All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you.
Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it.
Oh, well here. Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it again.
So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?
Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank.
(smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good.
Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain?
Now, there's a career path you may have overlooked.
Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read. I was wondering if-
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!
Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it?
You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here. Mike Wichter. He sold plastic straws. You know the ones? You could bend them.
No, it's a nine-hundred S. (happy) It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo!
But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.
Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing. Perhaps it's an homage.
We dont understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you cant stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I dont see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, lets make up our mind where we think theyre going.
(dialing) He got em out of the house.
Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.
You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal.
But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?
Oh I'm stressed! (makes like Kramer, outstretching his arm. Jerry heads for the freezer for some ice cream.)
Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
Okay, okay. Forget it. Its okay. I didnt mean it.
You don't think she's just talking to me?
I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.
Yeah but theres a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet.
As a guy I dont know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I dont know how to say, Bill, I feel I need to see other men. Do you know what I mean? Theres nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think thats the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because theyre two guys. Thats almost all we need to have in common. Cause sports  sports and women  is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, So, whats in the refrigerator?
(admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.
There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.
Is there, something I can help you with?
Have you ever spent any time with these people...?
The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.
Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here.
She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. [sarcastically] I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... >click click< Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? >click click< I'm back...
No, I do not like the bank. Ive heard the expression Laughing all the way to the bank. I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when theres nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, its empty and you still have to go through the little maze. (walking on the stage like he is going through a maze) Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? Im almost at the front. Id like a reward for this please.
I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.
okay , bye (to George) What happened , did you take it off?
Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat...
...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.
She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.
And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking?
Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
(trying to divert Vic's attention) What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that?
You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!
Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out...
So, can you believe that message? Now I?ve got to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!
No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.
Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.
I don't know, but you look like you're happy.
(Trying to get rid of her) Yes, I think it's a fine idea. Well, good night.
So lemme ask you this how long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night.
A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?
I still don't know what the idea is.
Hey, I had nothing to do with it.
No social reason for them to be here.
Im going out. (he comes out of the dressing room, while Kramer remains inside)
Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?
A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the dish and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit.
How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it.
We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these women.
You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em.
What happened to you? You were going like a hundred miles an hour.
Jenna's like me. She's very... (searches for word)
The fabric of society is very complex George.
No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.
Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. (Kramer goes to get the suit. Elaine enters.)
(Interrupting Bania) Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.
Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.
First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.
(upset) Ohhhh, what are you doing? Kessler, its a tape! I taped the game, its one oclock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.
Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.
So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?
But if you go back with me , then I'm not.
Uh, again? (Limping towards the door) I'll be right there.
So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out Im giving you a raise.
Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent. It's very boring.
(Reading from his notebook) I got You enter, you go "Hi", and I go, "Hello." Now.. we need something here..
You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift.
That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!
So you say she was on a horse?
Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.
You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?
No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.
He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication.
(flips a roll of paper towels in the air) Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.
Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?
Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions.
You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...
The uh toilet brush is under the sink.
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.
So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.
(to George) That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.
Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.
Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.
You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.
No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.
My bet? All right. Ill open with a tuna sandwich.
Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.
Hello,  oh hi Elaine .. what's going on  no he just left  you broke up with him?  ME TOO .. what happened?  oh smoking you know you're like going out with C. Everet Coope  me  nah  I couldn't go through with it  I just didn't feel ready  so what are you doing now?  Oh, great idea, I'll meet you there in like thirty minutes. Okay bye.
And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.
Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.)
But I could do that and the music.
We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?
Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless.
Over here. You can see right through here.
The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.
Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of?
I was kind of um (pauses) making out.
(to Kramer) It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Wheres she gonna get five thousand? She doesnt have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. Shes gone. Then you come in, Why dont you loan her five thousand? What do you care? Youve got five thousand. Give her five thousand!
No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.
That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little off.
(After seeing how much his parents like her) Now, I'm not so sure.
What, he doesn't like my taste in music?
Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.
Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.
Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so fuck(bleeped)ing good.
(pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?
Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.
Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
Oh, I cant believe it. Let me see that. (Jerry takes the paper.) Thats four and a half points in three days! Thats almost half my money!
(sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand.
Could you at least get a hat for me?
Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?
He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?
(eating pop corn) hmm I love this artificial flavoring I like it better than butter I think it's more consistent
Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity. 5? 3? Oh, it was just an expression. All right, well, that's very sweet of you. Okay, I'll call you later. All right, bye. Hey!
Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.
I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
Uh, how about a couple of people like us.
If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.
They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.
Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do some TV spots for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store. That was Leapin' Larry himself, I'm gonna meet with him tomorrow.
I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.
Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign.
Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
(Picks one up) Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?
It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?
Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.
(Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?
Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)
So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that...
(To George) You're off bread. (To Elaine) So what happened is it over?
Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it.
(animated) They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!
(takes the card from Elaine) We had a little fight this afternoon. (reading from card) Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe.
(Jokingly playing off Kramer's statement) With a different body.
Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George.
(giving him a steak from the fridge) Here ya go.
Elaine is having a "houseguest." She's picking him up at the airport tonight.
You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake.
I don't think the network will go for it.
What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time
No, I told you, it's just a dry run.
Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!
Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.
...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the patient!
Well ... ok, I guess (voice trailing off)
No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!
Oh, The Muted Heart. Glen Close. Sally Field. Well, that should be good.
Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?
It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.
(Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.
Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.
(Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.
Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener - what other conclusion could one reach? (The phone rings.)
There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing *just* a bra. I can't get that image out of my mind.
(Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in.
Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.
Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)
That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.
Quone? No, Im afraid that Im going to have to challenge that.
(Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.
And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya?
He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.
I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night only, the big screen. My hands are tied!
How ya doing? (George nods) Can't talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his brace) Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his eyebrows) I like that. (George sticks his tongue out) So how's life without tonsils? (George quickly indicates with his arm that he wants ice cream) What? What's that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?.. (George signals that it's more) Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy.. (George motions for ice cream again) What are you doing?
No, no Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.
George, who is that woman in the stripes?
Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the sirens song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?
One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub.
You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West? Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.
Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?
No. This is why you're not in the pilot.
No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.
(scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.
You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!
You're out of your mind you know that.
We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.
Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go.
Uh, yeah. (broaching a subject) Hey uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to a meeting.
Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!
They really should mention that in the breakdown height, weight, goiter.
Y'know a lot of people have asked that...
We don't hear that. (They enter the elevator)
I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.
(To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.
Hey Doc, check this out. [does an around-the-world with the Yo-Yo]
Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Yea nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?
Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)
All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.
What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's - it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it, and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you. (Nodding)
Well, I don't think I want to date a protg whose mentor is a Costanza.
(interrupts) What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today. (on the phone) Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we would do that. Okay. Great! Thanks a million! Okay, bye.
I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different... sources.
(quietly) I told you to cut it out.
So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) "Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again." They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system..."Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to the plane in my apartment." You see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet "hide-a-key" under the wing..."maybe he left it up there somewhere..."
Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.
I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.
Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off.
Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.
All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. She's at CALVIN KLEIN's right now.
(Gestures to his forehead) Youre getting that vein again.
And you didnt even hear how she sounded.
Nice Mohel picking, Elaine. You picked a helluva Mohel!
Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime.
Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome.
I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating.
It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.
Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.
I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.
Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.
(weary) Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out?
(TO GEORGE) Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?
(Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?
Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late.
No, it&Mac226;s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i...
Well, we gotta get it washed (pulls off a few flyers)....Ah, the keys are locked inside!
You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it.
Then what do you call it? People dont just bump into each other and have sex. This isnt cinemax.
Hey, were kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?
Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine!
I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad?
So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.
Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?
Especially that big kid up in the front. (Mr. Pitt is shown on the television, trying to hold up the deflating Woody balloon.) How old is he? (The phone rings.) Hello?
You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't remember anything about you.
I don't have it. You want half my omelet? (holds his omelet plate up to Bania)
George used up all my guest passes already.
So, she got you to join a book club?
Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want.
Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh...
You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?
(putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to Sopie's) Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship.
Theres one thing I dont understand. Why does it please you? (to the phone) George Costanza, please.
Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it.
Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I, guess she passed out!
This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.
Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.
(Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) "Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone." (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out "Just go" while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. (Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her.
Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.
Yeah, yeah. Sometimes shes on time, and... sometimes shes late.
alright I changed my mind, uh yeah I don't think I'm not gonna go now
Let's go out and celebrate! (they all get up)
...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either.
It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.
I think I heard her say something about a bench.
Does it ever bother you that this organization-
She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply)
Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - theyre doing sign language now.
Well, if that's not that, what is that?
But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.
So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.
I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?
So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box.
(ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.
Ive been thinking about asking this girl Im, uh, seeing-
Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.
Im just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.
I always feel bad for the silver medal winner in the Olympics. How do you live with that the rest of your life? People are gonna keep asking, "- How much did you lose by? - I don't even know...! It was like...(very fast) now.now...now.now..now..was like, like... now..now..now...! It was it...! Eh, it was it and I lost. I trained, I worked out, I exercised, I did everything, I was doing push-ups, sit-ups, I never did anything but exercise and work out for 20 years, I flew half way around the world and aaaaaaaaaah!...(showing a tiny distance between his index and thumb) And that was...it was a photo-finish! Silver...(stretching his neck forward)...gold. If I had a pimple, I would've won.
Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.
Uh, you know, why dont you go first, you just had a long trip.
Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time.
Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?
If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!
(to Kramer) ...( words missing)...laugh , everything's nice and at the end of the night I go for a little contact. I get the PULL BACK. This woman said the filthiest things I've ever heard in my life. I get the Pull Back.
'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.
Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs.
I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.
I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.
Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. "I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa " Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... (Naomi exits) it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality.
Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get in touch with you.
Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.
Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years.
A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?
Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.
(to himself) Once a week? (to Uncle Leo) So how's Lydia?
Yeah.. how about this I say "How's it goin'?"
Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!
Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!
(To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?
I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' (mimes throwing) 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?
Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.
The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like youre always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. Youre out somewhere with people, Gee, you look pregnant.. are you? Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, thats not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Lets take this whole scene again. People, think about what youre saying!
It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.
You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?
What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I dont even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. Thats what I want. I want an admission of guilt.
The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?
There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.
Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.
Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.
Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?
Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count on me! (hangs up)
See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.
But you yada yada'd over the best part.
Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...
I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.
Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!
Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.
Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that?
Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.
Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your..
Yeah, but this is different , this is like ,you know, semi digested food stuff. You know the next stop is the stomach and you can take it from there.
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.
Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?
Well I thought we'd both be getting married.
Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy.
(throws out his hands) What does he listen to? The all Desperado station?
You're still trying to gget that free sub?
Women need to like the job of the guy theyre with. If they dont like the job, they dont like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. Well, right now, Im the regional management supervisor. Im in development, research, consulting... Men on the other hand  if they are physically attracted to a woman  are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men dont really care. Menll just go, Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? Youre just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why dont you shower up, and well get some burgers and catch a movie.
What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like theyre trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?
Well, would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.)
You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."
The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.
Good shake. Perfect shake. Single pump, not too hard, you know, doesn't have to prove anything, but, you know, firm enough to know he was there.
No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.
Hi. Ah look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna.
Let me in, it's me. (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the dressing room) Here. You don't know what this is costing me. (hands Kramer the ticket)
So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table
Wait a minute, that's my ticket! You didn't even want to go.
Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!
Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.
How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!
Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.
Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly) and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it.
(shaking his head no) No Kramer I don't want to talk to him.
I thought we were going to the movies?
You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldnt expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.
No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.
You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.
You know, the water pressures terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower.
Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets.
Get out of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The Heart Attack')
[forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell out of here!
I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. "The New Yorker is stealing my ideas." ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real.
Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another mistake.
Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.
You picked up on a vibe, from a nun.
So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?
I never should have made up those rules.
Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...yknow, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, its dark, theres bubbles happening, theyre all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, Cmon babe, lets go. You come by, you open up the lid and theyll- (stiffens up, as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, theyre in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, Tomorrow, the dryer, Im goin. You wait here! The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you dont see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So theyre showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isnt your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first.
So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye.
What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to Kramers door) Ah hah.
You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.
Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will.
No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car.
Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.
Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, No egg white omelets. Look at that.
I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave.
That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.
Forget that. He's a ball player. MVP< 1979. I'm making wise cracks in some night club. This guy was in game six. They're a perfect match. They like go together. They're like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.
Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?
Well, theyre three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.
You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it)
Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.
(To Amy) Aha! So it's true! You were making out with him!
Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by the big showcase tonight.
Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together.
I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.
And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now.
Dont you think she woulda heard I was there?
(Pointing) I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.
I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.
Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other line. Just a second.
There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it..
I mean it's no big deal. You're still drivin'. You should have been watching the road.
You're really going to town with that turkey there.
Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry won't let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesnt that bother you?
All right! I'll do it. The race is on.
Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.
(exasperation) You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents.
Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.
You know, instead, Im like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.
It's been three days already, forget about Lupe.
If I like their race, how can that be racist?... Hellooo??... Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!... Yyy-yes, I am calling George... Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!
Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!
Well, maybe he doesn't have a "get outta here" kind of personality.
Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.
(Stops pulling on the pants) Alright, alright, That's no good. (Moves Kramer over to the couch) Let me try getting them from the bottom. (Goes for Kramer's Leg) Just gimme one leg.
"I don't know how you can eat that spicy chicken,"
Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews.
Uh huh. Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?
Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for?
Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.
Now thats not fair! So where did you meet this guy?
Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?
Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a person could still make a mistake like that.
Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain.
Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?
No, no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts.
(to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.
I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?
(To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.
Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em. (starts backing away as Kramer follows him around the room carrying the underwear)
But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship.
All right. As long as youre okay. Because I cant stop thinking about her.
Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.
That's what I do with him [points at George]
(dry) I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw? (really disappointed) Let's get out of here George.
Is that your "chicken" making all that noise?
No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.
Yeah, Im sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.
You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry?
Yes. Hes a doctor. (Elaine starts to leave. ) Wait a second. (Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in Elaines purse.) (to George) What are you doing?
Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?
So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't?
I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.
No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald cure.
You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.
If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.
So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?
SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?
Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I would've asked her.
You what? You passed? How could you do that?
Everyday is my birthday. (Sarcastically joking off what George said)
I cant believe Im gonna do this. (Jerry opens the door and exits the dressing room. He walks over to Bania)
You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.
What if hes in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (Jerry knocks on imaginary glass.) How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? (He makes a hissing sound.) By the way, whats happening with Sendrax?
Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!
Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes.
Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.
(Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?
Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.
It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...
(opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?
Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.
This is insane. You know, I dont even know where shes staying! She, shes not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.
I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal?
Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just "recede into the night," if you know what I mean.
You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that.
Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested)
Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?
No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?
This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy.
Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.
Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.
Well, well, look at you. It?s a little skimpy there isn't it?
You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.
I don't know how I feel about it.
Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
(checking his watch) I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again?
(continuing unphased) You wanna get the other end, cause I wanna get it in the hall.
How'd you expect to get out of here?
I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.
Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
(hanging up the phone) Oh! There's my Chinese food, I gotta run. All you.
You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.
Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here.
You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.
"Did you notice he always refer to himself in the third person. Jimmy can dunk. Jimmy's new in town. Jimmy we'll see you later."
There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her
Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!
Well, what kind of a kiss? Was it a peck? Was it a kiss? Was it a long make out thing?
(as George picks up a broken piece of his car) You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out...
Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.
So, tell me anyway. Who was the BIG mastermind?
Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of lobster)
This has 'international incident' written all over it.
So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought.... And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me.
Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.
No, I kinda tried to test his hearing.
You what?! Get out! (pushes Kramer) Ten thousand?
He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything.
Hey, ??? is rerunning the Yankee game. You watching this?
What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these, like Superman? I've got to unlock this mystery.
1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass!
Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys.
Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.
Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..
Well, its a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.
Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--
And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.
I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?
See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. (Elaine laughs.) All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free.
Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.
Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.
No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. Whats important is you two getting back together. Eh, then well talk about the car.
(C0NT'D) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.
Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?
If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld.
Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...
Where did you see that? Those are private!!!
(While looking at posters of women wearing glasses) I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.
cool guy? what are you, in 8th grade?
Well, it couldnt be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?
I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!
So you dont know whats wrong with him?
Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?
Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.
(Sarcastic) Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.
That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.
What're you doing? I thought you were changing.
(Hands him some mail) There you go. Merry Chirstmas!
All right, so youre chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead.
If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?
What's going on? You're the man of the hour, That's what's going on.
Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if its done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels!
Course you know there is always the possibility, that she called an audible.
Okay, Okay, I promise. (puts on the headphones again) Wow!!! Oh Man...Oh God.. Oh Brother....Whoooaaaa!! Whoaaaa (Elaine enters he takes them off rapidly)
Youre you. Were having lunch with Art Corvelay.
No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.
Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.
I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.
(leaving the room) I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much.
I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?
Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.
All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.
I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.
Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.
Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?
Oh, I was just looking for er, some... gum or... mint.
(thinking to himself; picks up a tube) "Fungicide". Fungus?
(pause) I thought you said... "ridicurous." (Donna looks puzzled)
No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station.
He bothers me. I dont even answer the phone anymore because of him. Hes turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.
We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.
(nonplused) You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?
No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.
Im not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll em down below my knee?
So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?
You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.
Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?
youre a real pleasure. (Jerry is being sarcastic)
So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night...
Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?'
Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.
All right. Come on sit down. It's about to start.
I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.
Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee)
(starts pulling them apart) Alright break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells)
Yeah, I cant eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I cant dance.
What you must understand, Elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) Youve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.
Well, what do you think the big holdup is?
I don't even think you could do it.
Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.
Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.
(sarcastically) Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.
Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.
Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.
Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.
(Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.
By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.
I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there.
Here. Take a look. What, what is that?
It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.
Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
O.K. from now on I want you to call me "Jerry the Great".
Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up) Since I said what?
Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.
Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer.
Revenge date? That sound like you more than me.
I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.
Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
(apologetically) Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.
No, no. Still doin the big sweep across.
What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.
Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment.
That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.
So tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?
So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.
I dont even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, Ive met them three times in my life.
Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.
(walking away) Well, I didn't sleep with her.
I mean I met her three times. I dont even know her last name.
(to the phone) No believe me, Im always up at this hour. How are you?... Great... Sure... What time does the plane get in?... I got my friend George to take me...
Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.
(in a hurry) Yea you're leaving at three o'clock.
Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.
Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.
(thinking) I cant believe it. I got nothing! I dont even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...
Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.
You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for?
Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?
Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket.
Aren't you going to take the check down?
I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.
You didn't like that crack about the pen.
Oh, well, I didnt actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into him there. (putting on coat)
All right, do you want the quarter, take the quarter, but don't try and tell me it's yours.
What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.
Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.)
It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.
So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?
How could you eat fish on a plane?
Why, what's wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders)
I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, "Oh This is so good. What's in it?" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not.
So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show, I waited for you, you never came.
(Trying to explain) Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past.
Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?
Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.
Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over my side.
Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--
Well. This should be a very interesting evening.
Wouldnt it be great if you could ask a woman what shes thinking?
No, I just wanted to see what time it was.
Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.
(downcast) No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
From my house. I got a whole box of them.
Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you.
You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.
Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.
And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my...
Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didnt want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And its been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. (to Kramer) All right, so, just take what you want and lets get it out of here.
Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.
You unwittingly made a major commitment. That's a lot of pressure.
A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision.
They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor.
You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool.
So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.
You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it.
I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them are doing her dance as they go)
See...women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel...
George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.
So the roommate laughed at everything I said.
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.
Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?
Im not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want.
I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...
No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?
(naked, carrying a belt sander) I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.
(Joking around) I think it's the stench of death.
He looks like you and he's working from the inside?
Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.
I know nothing, but what did you actually do?
(To Elaine) It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's unconscious.
Lemme just check my messages. (to himself) Maybe a nicer girl called.
I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral?
Why dont you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps.) Whats wrong?
Uh, I don't know, we used to go out.
You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!
Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.
She'll have a cup of coffee and a broiled chicken.
I'm in the book and I have a machine.
Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 630 and gimme a call.
I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.
Hey, guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!
You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?
(apologetic) Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.
I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.
(Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?
Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...
I don't think I can be that nice.
Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?
Where are you going, you just got here?
You better finish your little caf latte there. They won't let you in with it.
(extemporising) That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go.
What are you doing? You're choking me. Elaine!
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.
Thats the bet! (The phone rings; Jerry answers it.) Hello?... No- oh, hi... (Kramer leaves) no, they just left... Oh, my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch em. (Jerry goes over to the window and opens it; calling out the window) Ma! Ma! Up here! Dont get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!!
(Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.
You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 950, I'm not gonna be able to make it!
Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno.
George, I've been sick all week. Elaine was too. Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes. Do the math. Yeah, maybe I will get out. Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first. Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something. Yeah, Selwyn's. Okay bye.
Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. and we got to talking, he sells Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.
Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.
I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.
George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman!
Good, going good (scratches chin) And the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty good - not bad - I gotta get out. (scratches chin, nose then covers eyes with hands)
Im sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil
Actually it's being taken care of right now.
I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?
(calls) Hey you two. Im ready to go.
Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?
Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)
So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, "Jerry"? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They're putting it on the air! They're giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California!
Hey Kenny. (with some fake enthusiasm, just to be polite)
I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?
Elaine, see this T-shirt, six years I've had this T-shirt. It's my best one, I call him Golden Boy.
No good. Too many people know the combination.
Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?
So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?
Where have you been? You know, you're on next.
I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.
(coming out from the bathroom) who was it?
All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.
Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!
I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner
I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.
There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
Well what about me! If you're going like that, I?m not going like this.
Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!
I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club.
Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.
No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. Maybe we should ask him.
Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets.
(Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say "Hi", and I say "Hello".
No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it. (thinks out loud, opens phone book) Becker, ... Becker, ...
(answering the phone) Hello? Yeah, the van is still for sale. Sure, come on buy.
(pulling on a jacket) They had a cancellation and they instantly called me.
I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer?
Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here.
No, nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table)
Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for? I don't know about that, I'll have to think about it. I'll let you know. Okay, bye.
I know exactly whats gonna happen tonight. Im gonna try and act like Im not impressed, hes gonna see right through it.
Hey you know George isn't to happy, ahh, about your new friendship.
Excuse me.( gets up and opens the door)
I'm not talking about upside down. (Jean-Paul and Kramer come in) I'm talking about waking him up!
Oh, the sisters (he sits at the table)
Hey, hey, what are you doing, that?s my quarter.
how can u say things like that over the phone?
Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.
I don't know. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley..."
You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us.
..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beveridged!
Yeah, yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. Would you mind. I'd like to take the picture back.
Thats not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table repeatedly.) You know, maybe its not that bad an idea.
That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.
He might want a show about anything and everything.
Schumann. (George stops himself, frightened. Jerry looks around the lobby.) Where are they?
George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?
Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.
(finding Frankie, in his hole) Frankie... come on out of there.
Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I cant ask her.
Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything. Why don't we all just go to Paris?
Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person -
I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.
Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to 'em. Mind if I walk through real quick?
Well what am I going to tell Alex?
What do you think it could've been just some dude?
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!
(Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.
How am I going to live with myself?!
Gee, I just didnt expect it from the way youve been acting.
I mean, she called me. I havent called her. She started it.
Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- Zip, I'm gone. (makes a running motion with both arms and his right foot)
Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!
(Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did!
What I said. Ive been under a lot of stress.
Wow. Kenny Rogers Roasters. Finally open. Hey, look at the size of that neon chicken on the roof.
Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.
Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly.
Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.
I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y. (he spits it into the waste bin)
No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!
I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?
Let me tell you something Babu. You go back in that kitchen -- tell your chef I want the works.
Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.
Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.
Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!
What if he doesn't call now out of spite?
He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.
Well, for one think, don't listen to him.
Sample? (under his breath) Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book.
Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? Im sorry. I didnt mean it. I took it out on you. Were still friends. Were still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, Ill tell you what. Ive got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.
(still watching tv; sounds like basketball) Bottle-wipe supercedes it.
We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.
(in the hallway, hearing the door lock behind him, turns back) Kramer!
I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!
They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record.
It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)
All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the bottle of fungicide.)
Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 650 AM tomorrow morning.
Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.
To the Paul Simon concert in the park!
You must have quite a time down there.
I'm gonna call the cops. That?s what I?m doing, I?m calling the cops.
Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?
I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
"Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old married couple--" *I told you that pear was washed*!
They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?
(with a wild expression) Hey, Kramer! I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open!
Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the verge of this big promotion?
I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I cant imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but thats me. Alright
You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didnt take it. (pointing to himself) This is an idiot.
I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say.
I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.
40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?
Dont worry. (whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!... Its Jerry!... Jerry!... From next door!... Never mind where I am!... Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!...
You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner.
It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.
John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.
I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.
What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy?
No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.
Yeah, so do you. (George enters with a newspaper.)
How do you know she's not my wife?
Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.
By the way, just for the record -
Shes waking down the street and it hit her in the head!
Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...
Ya, that's the.. last thing you want to see. Well, next to last.
Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?
I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous!
Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!
This stuff on top is my friends. Could I get it done in a separate machine?
All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?
Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.
I think thats the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!
I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away)
Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.
Its a list of excuses, its for that guy, Horneck, whos at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I dont have to see him. (Elaine laughs.) I need it. (Elaine starts writing on the list.) What are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's.
Hello? Oh, hi honey. (annoyed, weary) Yes, I told him. I'll get it. (George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry to argue with Meryl on the phone.) Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...
I think I offended the wake-up guy...! (worried)
Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.
Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.
It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.
Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.
Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it!
I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.
That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no--
I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?
I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.
Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.
I don't know him. I know who he is.
Well its not like it's a really funny story or anything.
What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.
Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!
Uh, THANKS! This is FUN! Yeah, this turned out to be a GREAT weekend.
I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.
You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married.
(Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to look, but Jerry stops her) I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs.
Ah. But they told us we must go now.
I think I may have made a big mistake.
How many times you been out with him?
(pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you lay it out on the bed.
I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?
Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected, outwardly.
Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery.
Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?
But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.
Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.
(consternation) Oh no. (to the bedridden two) It's go time.
Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.
Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- Ill be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too.
Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her!
Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.
But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.
Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!
You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.
All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.
I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?
Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.
Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else.
No, its not you. Its your stomach, hes taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.
You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.
who do you think she is? how dare she? you want me to get the manager? too bad they don't have those old ladies walking around with flashlights anymore we'd flush her out
He's been sleeping a lot. He's still groggy.
George? (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.
You want to go with me to NBC?
No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver.
I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
(touching the back of his neck) It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.
Let me get a clean pair. (Goes into his room. George strides over to the window.)
I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.
Honey, what'd you do with the can opener?
Well, then Im not going to the game either. Okay? Ill give him both tickets.
Well put something down, youre taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac and Artie, theyre all coming over here before the wedding?
(on phone) Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil.
Ah, I should have got the egg white omelet.
Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, (looking at the TV) Kramer, turn that up.
I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. (Miss Rhode Island laughs.)
You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.
Alright, come on, lets get out of here.
So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry?
Right. For the reducing of the pond scum?
I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!
Why don't you see what you can do?
Seth, it's me. What's more important than catching up with an old college buddy?
But then anyone can just look in and see you.
Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
(interrupting) Can I talk to you for a second?
Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump over the net.
But its common sense. Hes got super strength, super speed. Im sure hes got super humor.
Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.
Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am  rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give...
So write a letter.. move to another...move to Staten Island., 'lot easier to blend in a sea of people in Staten Island than China believe me.
Good evening, folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--
I don't know if they have land guys.
Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.
I'm going to the hospital to see Fulton. I'm not even saying hello, I'm going right into material.
I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..
Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.
You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're lifting heavy suit cases.
Yeah, yeah, take care of it. (Jerry throws her some toilet paper) Come on, George, what is it?
(on the phone) Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Ya. Oh, really? Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye. (hangs up the phone) Well, the yogurt verdict is in. (Kramer looks at Jerry with his arms out) Fat!
Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh...
Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.
All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry.
You had a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with my butler?
Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something.
All right, forget it, its over, Im not moving.
(He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.
All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom cab.
But then I found out about the skin cancer.
And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?
Well you said they could come and take the records.
I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...
Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips.
What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.
Well, I painted my apartment again. Ive been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, its a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize its just the thickness of the paint, but Im aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, its closer and closer. I dont even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. Thats where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control... Thats why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching TV. Thats why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there.
I, I'm not happy with what I wrote.
Well, you want to sit with George? I think he's coming with Robin.
you know I'd like to hear about this job of yours
I hear you're going out with David Putty.
That was brutal. I cant go back out there.
There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of... (he cracks) Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?!
Yeah. (thinking) That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. (decisive) I'm gonna do it.
Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.
I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?
So I can see her tonight, and you dont care?
Yeah, that's a deal. That's a terrible deal. I don't want to go out to dinner with him. Id rather make my own suit.
I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.
Yeah. I want that coat. (Jerry opens his wallet, looking for the dry-cleaning ticket)
I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...
On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?
That is a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. Some guy from NBC saw my set, he wants me to do a showcase. I might have another shot at a pilot.
Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
(worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!
(to Elaine, still joking) He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!
He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.
George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.
Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I?m serious, I?m not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.
I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.
I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, Well, its ruined. And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, Its not our fault. Were not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation. You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? Theyre cleaning our clothes, but theyre not getting anything wet. Its all dry. I know theres gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that theyre using. Theres no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (Jerry brushes off his shirt.) Thats dry cleaning. I dont think thats what theyre doing back there. They dont have eighty guys going, Come on, hurry up! Theres a lot of shirts today!
Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?
He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, that were manufactured in Korea.
Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.
I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.
Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!
Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.
I'm NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT! ..
And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.
No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.
But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.
Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?
Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)
I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.
That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.
You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?
I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing.
Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?
Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?
No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.
Shes right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, Im gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.
What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?
Get in there. (he pushes George in the direction of the restaurant)
Pull over? The lieutenant is waiting to see us.
The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.
You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? When I'm on stage that's all I hear; You stink, You suck. We like magic.
I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.
(agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!
(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.
Yours?....You know what I'll think I'll brush later.
Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in!
Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order.
Actually, yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!
What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp, why do you want shade?
Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. (Kramer picks up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.) Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! (Kramer starts filling a pot with water.) What are you doing with that?
Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.
So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?
Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?
Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em.
Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender! (an event guard stops them)
Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. (Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks at Kramer.)
(Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell smoke?
'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?
You do of course try on, when you buy?
Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.
That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.
Okay... but theres no cake or anything, if thats what youre looking for.
Would you turn that down! What is that crap!
I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.
Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.
I could tell you what I did, but you wouldnt believe it. Its not believable.
(What's goin' on,) like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--
Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll *all* be over...
(yell) Move to the back of the drawers!
You are. I can't get that thing in my car. (referring to George)
You got a little shmootz there (picks something on her sweater)
Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.
This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!
Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place.
No economic reason for them to be here.
You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?
Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here.
I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?
This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.
You see the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around, but they don't know they're ugly, because nobody actually tells them.
(To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom buzzes) That's Elaine. (Kramer buzzes her in. Jerry talks into the phone) Kramer.. (To Kramer) George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.
Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.
Whats to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.
All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.
Hey, I've been back four days, I want my mail.
Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.
Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.
Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead.
I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.
If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.
Oh, see the baby again with the baby..
Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift. I know, it's a label maker. The Label Baby Junior. Yeah, I hear they're good. Well, label me thankful. Okay, well you enjoy those tickets. Buh-bye.
Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.
Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.
Are saying you're banning me from the store?
I dont wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do you think?
Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met!
You're meetin' the father for the first time?
(on the phone) hey Andre, get the hell off the phone!
Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something.
Oh, what about this one? Look at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for. (Sits on the couch.) Oh, yeah!
I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.
This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!
Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph?
I got one problem. Youre keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that shes coming.
I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.
(with no emotion) It's okay. Everything is going to be all right.
It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.
Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.
Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.
How can I want it now, if you want it?
(on phone) But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.
(interrupting) No no it's ok. (walking Rachel out) So we'll go see Schindler's List later right?
Many times. You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet.
Im meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.
There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.
Have you thought any more about that trip?
I got your message, (sitting) so I came straight from Atlantic City.
Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.
George got him fired. He squealed on him.
I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. (Slams the door on Newman's face. Then tries to delay talking to Newman by keeping the conversation with George going) So, you want a protein shake, or something?
(to the phone) Hello yeah yes it is really ah, ah Could you hold on a second? (to George and Kramer) Hey listen to this, some woman found an electronic organizer, my name was in it, she wants me to help her track down the owner.
Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one.
Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.
Well, you know; not everything. I do what I can.
Yeah. (Kramer sits in the seat next to Jerry) Uh, uh, oh, oh, Over there. (points to the next seat over)
(in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.
Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there.
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
I might need you to get me a soda.
That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and-
Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up)
Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it.
Yeah. What's wrong, why? ( George runs back to the bathroom)
Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.
(on phone)Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.... it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye.
What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?
Well how did he react when you gave it to him?
Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, "You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"
Well, I have some money. What do you need? (pulls out some bills)
(cynical) This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday?
Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?
No, let's just do it. (Fire alarm goes off) What? What is going on? What is that about?
Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.
Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.
First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.
Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.
You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?
Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here (points to kitchen), here (points to living room), or here (makes similar circle with his hands).
(waving the key) You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!
Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.
I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.
You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.
Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.
How 'bout if it was something like " I can't find my receipt my place's a stye.
I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide.
Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye. (Hangs up) Hey, I'm flyin' first class.
Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?
Oh, w-what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore?
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.
Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!
You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.
I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.
All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now, be reasonable you cannot turn down $50 for a $6 rye.
Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, Yeah, I got this new thing Platonic. My idea, my name, callin it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- dont do anything, and go right home. Whatd you think? I think its going to be big! I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didnt work. Yknow, I bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, Uh, Hi, uh my names Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, its a Riconic relationship.
You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.
Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down. It's a business.
U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you?
(thinking) Thank you, Pamela! (turns to talk to Vanessa; to Vanessa) So, youre a lawyer...
Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.
And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.
Hey, hey. uh Pamelas birthday party, didnt I see you there? Jerry.
Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.
I was hoping you'd offer. (The intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
(as Ping rambles on ) ...S'cuse me (Ping looks up) Kind of an expensive call.
That was a one in a million Mohel.
(Like an Army general) Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys.
Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.
Well, thats it. You two are back together.
In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.
(Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!
Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me.
My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? (to the intercom)
What! You're the one who ruined her life.
I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care
Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.
(unheard by Jenna) When the battery runs out.
No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-
All right, that's not bad. Now get over here!
Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.
Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.
(Reasoning) You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place!
Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.
All right, I'll see you after school. I,,m late for Hayman's hygiene.
Hey, thanks a lot for lettin' me stay here.
Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. (pointing at the umbrellas) What've you got in a push-button mini.
Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.
Yeah, and, (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly exiting) time.
I'll pick you up at your apartment. We'll go to the Eight.
hey where were you last night? I looked for you, I didn't see you
Hey look, there's a spot right in front.
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world He's Boring.
I don't know. That's like asking "Where's Waldo?"
I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a "magical world" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.
(Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.
Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy.
(picking up his bag and coat) Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?
Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.
I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.
Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! (Kramer exits.)
Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.
That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow. It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.
It's a movie stub from the 930 show. George, I think Willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes.
Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.
Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.
She likes him I mean she really likes him.
Relax, hes late. Hes always late. Its part of his M.O.
A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see 'em. Come on, I'm calling! (thumps hand on table) What d'you got!
So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on me.
Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)
Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.
All right, sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) George?
Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets.
There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.
Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.
Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.
Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.
Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.
C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one.
Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.
No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.
(Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.
So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?
If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.
I suppose if it was on the protg's way to the mentor, they might.
I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.
Can I make it up to you? Ill give you fifty bucks for the jug.
Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that. (stepping over Elaine then George's legs to get to the large blue chair and sits down.)
Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.
Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.
It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
Well, either you see him or you don't.
Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. (pause) Did you?
Well... theres a little bit of a problem.
(Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there.
Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.
(TO KRAMER, REBOX) Will you let me help you with that?
Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.
Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.
All of a sudden it hit me, I realized what the problem is; I can't be with someone like me.. I hate myself!! If anything I need to get the exact opposite of me....It's too much. It's too Much I can't take it ...I can't take it!!!
He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.
Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?
Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours?
Hang on just let me pick up a paper.
That is so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood horse?
Yeah, dont investigate, dont pay me back, it was an accident.
Could you move your car back a little?
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?
These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you?
Why should I have anything for say for myself?
And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.
(looks round) Don't worry, I'll get you out.
(hands up) I don't want it that way.
What are you so worried about this for?
No, I don't want that smell in the house.
It's stuck. (pained) Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood.
The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now.
Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
Aah! .. right. The ones from Oregon that are only ripe for two weeks a year..
(smiling) Really? That's great. You said that to him?
I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
(continuing) The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.
Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said "Too bad he's gay".
They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.
Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for?
Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom.
Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.
(arriving at apartment, sees Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from Kramer's) So you live right... there.
That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother.
Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?
Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police! Some guy just gave me a wise answer. Ask that woman.
Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.
(a lightbulb goes on in his head) Riverside Drive.
And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She says, "That's funny." ... That's funny!
I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.
Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! (runs back to his seat) Bad lighting on the porch.
No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.
Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe well get together.
All right take it easy, just take it easy.
Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.
Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.
(Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?
It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.
So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.
Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie.
I think I saw one a coupla doors down.
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--
(Smiling, like a salesman) All right. Now, what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today?
Oh Yeah we went way out and wild.
Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?
All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.
I think theres a mental hospital near here.
I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.
(on phone) Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago.
Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight!
Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your guy?
Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal.
Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? (hands Elaine the tape recorder.)
So you just pretended it didnt bother you?
Whenever I see the news and they're hauling in some kind of terrorist, psycho, maniac, mass murderer guy. You notice he's always covering up his face with the newspaper, with the jacket, with the hat. What is he worried about? I mean what is this man's reputation? That he has to worry about this kind of exposure damaging his good name? I mean, what is he up for a big job promotion down at the office or something? Afraid the boss is gonna catch this on TV and go "isn't that Johnson from sales? He's up in that clock tower picking people off one by one. I don't know if that's that kind of man we want heading up that new branch office. He should be in bill collection. I think he's got aptitude."
(looking of into the distance) I guess that's true...
Hey. So how was"Blame it on the Rain?"
Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Just give me a little squeeze.
I dont give out bites. I got another one. But Im saving it for later.
Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . What could he do?
Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!
oh you think she's Erika, the phone sex woman
(adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.
Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, thats a good idea.
I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.
But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!
At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.
So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots.
It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.
So Whatley sayd to me, "Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic."
(to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!
Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.
(in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine) So did you figure out Darryl's... you know.
That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I got.
(to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...
(Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.
I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone.
Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?
(long pause).......Sure. ( humms a song then stares at the toothbrush)
(under his breath) Well, this worked out just as I had hoped.
How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?
We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?
What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?
(Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.
Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.
Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?
The one Puddy screamed at in the car?
(pointing out the obvious) George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him.
(to waiter) Ill have a cranberry juice with two limes.
Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?
Its not promised to anybody? Cause shed take it in a second.
(To George) Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?
Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.
..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.
(hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman.
Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves)
Hey, wait a second. You know, we could share a cab. They're playing at the same Cineplex.
Oh, no. Its not that I dont think you can. I know that you cant, and Im positive that you wont.
yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas..
(putting the phone back to his ear) Yeah.
Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.
George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say,kookie talk.
Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.
hey you know it's weird because that voice sounded a little familiar to me
(frustrated, to self) The whole system is breakin' down!
Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.
Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.
That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.
Of course I want to talk about it.
Yknow Im sorry you had to leave so early the other night.
Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?
That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up. (phone rings) Excuse me one second.
At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.
Well I guess if I?m the Miana I should go. All right, all right.
I had a statue! What should I do?
But you were supposed to get me a refund.
Kramer! (We hear Kramer's door slam open and shut. Kramer enters. Jerry comes out of his room.) Hey! Where's all my sneakers?
Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.
That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus?
All right, fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone)
Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.
George, I want you to promise me something. If Im ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.
(hands it to him as he asks ELAINE) So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?
Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser.
Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.
How do you stop a kid from growing?
I guess you can take anything, but actual work.
If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.
So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?
Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?
No he's going downtown to guard the suit.
We'll see about that. (Runs to the window and shouts up to Kramer, who's on the roof.) Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win!
Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?
You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding.
Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy. You don't have to mention the bubble boy? I know about the bubble boy. I'm aware of the bubble boy. Why do you keep reminding me about the bubble boy?
Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.
You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.
"You find you need to use a lot of obscenities at the dentist.
Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles...
Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good things.
"Of course.... But that's got nothing to do with it."
(putting on his coat to go downstairs, he finds the key in his coat pocket) I believe this belongs to you.
Well what am I supposed to do now?
Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.
The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.
Oh yeah, Sfuzi? I- I've gotta do that.
Come on, take them. You could take Bonnie.
The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?
Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.
Look, youre a nice guy, its just that... we dont have anything in common.
I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man.
You want to spend the rest of your life with her
yeah, it's a damn shame, a damn shame!
(getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.
(impressed) Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.
You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.
There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.
I don't know Kramer, ahh, my concern is that ....
There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.
Oh, nothing happened, you know, but is was great.
I don't need a reason to give gifts, it's my nature. I love to make people happy.
What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming "There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!" And then, when they all run into the other direction, we'll jump in the car!
No. So, we're still on to see uh, Firestorm tonight?
(disappointed) Answering machine. (jovially) Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.
(to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here.
Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, "Those aren't buoys." (Father starts laughing) Father...
... as long as one of them is not him.
The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.
Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...
Girls. There's girls right here in the store. Look, look, there's one over there. Look, there's another one. Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there. What's the matter?
Oh who made you a Mohel? Whadya, get your degree from a matchbook?
All right, Elaine but this is beyond news. This is like Pearl Harbor. Or the Kennedy assassination. It's like not even news. It's total shock.
I'm not sure, but I think she was nice. (takes a sip of water)
[To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.
You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?
Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.
Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?
I don't care, why are you telling me this?
Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.
Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, "Photographs - Do not bend".
Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series.
Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.
I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.
Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?
Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.
What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?
Elaine, he's a.. he's a male bimbo, he's a mimbo
Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear?
The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too.
The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. Cause it says Waiting Room. Theres no chance of not waiting. Cause they call it the waiting room, theyre gonna use it. Theyve got it. Its all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and youve got your little magazine. You pretend youre reading it, but youre really looking at the other people. You know, youre thinking about about them. Things like, I wonder what hes got. As soon as she goes, Im getting her magazine. And then, they finally call you and its a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. Well, I guess Ive been chosen. Ill see you all later. You know, so you think youre going to see the doctor, but youre not, are you? No. Youre going into the next waiting room  the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You dont wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You dont want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in? Do they scalp tickets to these things? I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two...
Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back
(Giving Newman a sour look) I'm just hanging out in this hell-hole because of George.
Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.
Hey I don't even want the pen now!
Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.
I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... (Jerry stops, and mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica on the phone at work.)
Yeah..... He caught me So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend to look at the coat.
Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?
Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune.
Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...
You're passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago!
What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha ha!
The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.
He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.
Well there's always a place for you, on our team.
...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to.
Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house  and then I saw it in your house.
No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy.
All right. (picks up the alarm clock) Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 650... volume check. (music playing, he starts swinging) What kinda music you wanna wake up to? Top 40, classical...
(surprise) You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building too?
Religion, my friend, thats what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that its going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.
Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me.
... if this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this woman to help me I would have killed this man. I would have strangled the life out of him with my bare hands
I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.
What did you do the rest of the day?
You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs.
Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) Thats it. Done!
Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money.
Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.
If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?
C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.
Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.
But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there, "Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin. Well I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on."
Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.
Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.
Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I?m the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me!
That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great! (he starts to install the table)
Hi. Hi Winona. Nice to see you again.
Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?
Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.
(doubtful) I don't know, do you have a--
I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?
(thoughtful) Hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey, there it is.
You promise you'll never come in here again?
Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.
That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way.
[not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]
Well, the pickle breath is a good start.
(bored) Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it.
If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.
Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish...
Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?
(Still pulling on Kramer's pants from the ankles) Man these are tight. (Yanking) Squinch your hips in
I gotta say, thats pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.
Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.
No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.
(answering) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Um, its for you.
Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.
It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look (searches for word) stupid. (to salesman) I'm sorry.
No, I had to tell my friends  my friends didnt have to tell you.
Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.
That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!
Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet.
What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.
I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.
Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason.
You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?
Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.
Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!
Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine.
The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)
I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? "You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know "No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back."
All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! Just wait here and I'll get it for you. ... Kramer this is Tia.
Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch?
I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?
I don't like this Kramer. Will it be much longer?
(privately amused) Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while. (indicating Elaine) Her too.
(Singing) Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!
Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car!
(thinking) Yeah, thats normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?
He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about "Jerry."
He doesn't even care if a man answers.
Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.
No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?
You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. Hmmm. What do you want?
I didnt know what the coma etiquette was.
Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?
If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.
Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.
I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldnt do that.
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.
Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I dont feel comfortable in them.
Oh yeah. He's good. You know he's John Ritter's cousin.
One of the problems in life is that when youre a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, I got the front seat I wanted the front seat! I called it. And the other kid knows hes got nothing to say He called it. What can I do? If there was a Kid Court Of Law, it holds up. Your Honour, my client did ask for the front seat And the judge would go, Did he call it? Well no, he didnt call- BANG! (Jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled.
I got you an apartment in the building.
Yeah, well I don't trust this guy. I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.
I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.
No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial.
Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing?
The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.
No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.
Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.
Oh my eh, my Aunt's name is Mulva. She's-she's a masseuse.
What do you mean? They know we're here.
Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?
Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea.
That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.
How do you do? (introducing himself) Uh, Jerry Seinfeld.
I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something!
Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.
Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.
Thats not too bad. Its not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth? (Elaine laughs silently)
Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.
What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?
Really? Did you hear that? Somebody else was killed!
I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.
(to George) She thinks it's someone named Raef.
Come on! I know it's something you wanna do! (she pulls harder and he falls right off the table)
Im Dan. Can I have my list back, please?
(testing Joel) So, Im thinking about going to Iran this summer.
George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, ok...do we know where the 101 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 170 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 134 is? (George just looks at Jerry) No. Aha, ok. (Jerry hangs up) He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up.
I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.
No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman.
Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him )
Well this is a great place to sit you got here.
We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident.
(Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my domain. But I will tell you this I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!
Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?
Hi. Hi. Look, I don't know what you think --
You want to go to Mendys, Ill take you to Mendys.
I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from.
I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.
If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.
Ohh ... (takes the ticket and heads for the dressing room)
Wow, look at you. So you got the job.
Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know its missing, and he took it! And of all things to take! I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. Hes crazy.
(reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.
Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.
Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
An old friend of mine, whom you may have met, George Costanza, has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formally a highly placed official with an outfit known as the IRS. And as we speak, at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information. And she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise.
It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.
(interrupts) I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.
Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.
But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?
you know, I think George has a non-sexual crush on him
And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.
Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.
(talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass.
Hey listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, why don't you have dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if you want, you know, have a little company, take the pressure off.
Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. (George gives Elaine a look while Jerrys back is turned. Jerry turns around.) I saw that.
So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you.
Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.
Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.
Where did you come up with all that stuff?
Thirty-six. What's the signal? Howbout this? Chicken wing? No, no, no, I got a better one. Head patting.
It's alright, I want you to have it.
There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.
Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby.
Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine)
I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You know (does the motion for the check) Check, Check. Unless the waiter isn't too shape then you gotta total it up. Sometimes they come over, "Do you want the check?" No I wanna be pen pals, can't you see what I'm doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people.
Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more.
No, no, no, it's... "She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her."
Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame.
Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.
Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.
But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?
No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?
Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy.
Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.
Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?
Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?
It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?
Um, actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet. (takes the paper back)
Oh, you want to try the syrup! (Meryl smiles and takes it. The waitress comes over.)
I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.
The % thing to do is just not think about it.
He was down at the other end. So he yells out, "Ready, On your mark, Get set, " and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.
(incredulous) You asked her to move in with you?
He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes.
Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited.
That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.
(animated) You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I...
(leaving) You two keep an eye on each other?
Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!
For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.
It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination. I would have killed this man. Torn him limb from limb, ripped the flesh right off his bones ...
Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.
All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.
(barring the way) I'm sorry. I-I don't know you.
You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.
You got toilet paper on your heel there.
I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.
I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.
Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.
There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair, striped shirt?
Uhn-uh-uhn - Uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer A-Ha ha! Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe. (singing) dee, de-de, de-de-de-de-de (Makes G.I. Joe swim off, legs kicking)
(to the phone) Oh, its you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldnt have had to do this. Now thats two long distance calls I made to you why cant you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again; to nobody) Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much.
What do you think the Nazis were doin? (Imitates the Nazis salute) That was the heil-five.
No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.
Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend.
(still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)
Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me.
This is a person I like, its not How to score on spring break.
I didnt know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrants going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesnt make sense. Am I wrong?
(Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.
Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.
Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. (They go out into the hallway and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.) Hey, how ya doin.'
Alright.. (Heads for the door, grabbing his coat)
The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..
Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?
I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.
So, what are you up for? How about Mexican?
Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.
(mind's voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?
Hey, when Im driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. Im always waving everybody in. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. ...All right. All right. Ill have a chicken salad.
Yes, I know youre not gonna do it. Thats why I bet.
How can you think of food at the time like this?
Well I think I get the gist of it.
Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough.
Ok, great, well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu.
The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California!
Thats comforting. Shh. Hes coming. (to Ray) Ray?
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.
Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.
Ma, you cant look up words in the dictionary! (to Morty) Dad, shes cheating!
... I just got a postcard from Elaine?
I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?
What is this? What are we doing? What in god's name are we doing?
Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm.
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. (casually leaves)
You know, I think he wears a piece.
What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.
What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in it's path.
Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.
No. We gotta go to the soup place.
(Trying to change the subject away from Nina) Hey - Hey Kramer, what are you doing? You want to borrow something? You want to eat something? Come on in!
(A couple of days ago I used a public phone), go over time on the call, hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, "Yeah, operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?"
Kramer, why do you have to (noticing Newman) Hello, Newman.
Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.
So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more "grease monkey".
I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.
(still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.
Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.
Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.
You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin them whenever I want!
She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence
And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month!
Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. (standing) I'm going to the bathroom.
Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.
No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?
You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.
(Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!
Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.
Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?
(extemporising) Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was registered under Slappy White.
No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him.
Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it.
You cannot buy half a can of soda.
All the time. Ive been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I cant live like this. I dont know what Im gonna do. Im heading for breakdown! (to Harold) Cant you do something?
Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.
This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...
It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.
Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.
Anyway Beth, you know i was thinking on my way over how when i was 9. I wanted these handball sneakers, they were all black but they came in adult sizes so you know i never got the sneakers. (Beth looks him confused)
And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone.
Oh my god. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops!
(Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.
Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!
Could you excuse me one second? Im sorry.
No in a matter of fact it isn't.
I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?
Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.
Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.
First of all, I made plans with Elaine.
Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.
See, its never as bad as you imagine.
If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened.
So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?
Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?
I cant think about it now. Come on, Im going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.
Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?
He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.
I don't know, but we don't have much time.
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.
Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.
You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.
But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.
I said yes, but I don't feel right about it. I mean I hardly know the guy. That's a big step oin a relationship. The biggest. That's like going all the way.
So youre sure youre not still angry about last night?
(thinking) Whats going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, shes too good to be alone. Whats the difference, I cant maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me.
I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.
Let's get outta here. [to Buckles] I'll see ya.
