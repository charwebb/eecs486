I dont see architecture comin from you.
What?
That was our babka.
(looking at Kramer's moustache) Uh, we're not doing that anymore.
I'm going
(leaving; singing) She'll be coming around the mountain...
Yeah.
Thank you.
Oh, yes you will.
No, no that's for a drug overdose.
I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didnt want to talk to, I could go, Excuse me, Im not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away. I also have a cordless phone, but I dont like that as much, because you cant slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone  You cant talk to me like that! Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone  You cant talk to me like that!
Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?
About what?
It's like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action.
(thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And Ive still got another day! Ive got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. (to Vanessa) Thats a nice watch. Do you wind it?
Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.
Actually, no.
(reluctant) Nah, nah. I'd rather...
I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, Well, its ruined. And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, Its not our fault. Were not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation. You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? Theyre cleaning our clothes, but theyre not getting anything wet. Its all dry. I know theres gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that theyre using. Theres no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (Jerry brushes off his shirt.) Thats dry cleaning. I dont think thats what theyre doing back there. They dont have eighty guys going, Come on, hurry up! Theres a lot of shirts today!
So how was it?
Sure.
That's a date?
What if I lose it?
It's supposed to be hot.
You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.
Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?
Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.
Hi!
I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life.
I wouldn't use her toothbrush.
Yeah, right.
What?
Hello?
How do you explain your apartment?
Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything.
You can't go to China What about your job?
I don't like this Kramer. Will it be much longer?
Oh, I turned my jacket inside out.
Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?
In two days.
So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?
Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to fancy restaurants. (takes a sip of water)
Oh, I'd love to, are you sure?
Mickey Mantle?
Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested)
I was talking to him.
I don't wanna use your car.
....Alright, alright, I saw her!
You're still trying to gget that free sub?
"That's Jimmy. That's the way he talks."
I think that's a little extreme.
Spring. Of course.
No.
Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I never know what to write on these things. I hate doin' this.
Out.
All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.
What did you say?
What about?
What?
No.
These pretzels are making me thirsty.
Ma!
What I said. Ive been under a lot of stress.
Oh really?
They're having sex in the hotel room.
no what?
I think that's a 5-19.
Well what is it?
(to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!
(Goes up to it) This?
Kramer!!!
Is that guy still there? (They are side-on to Phil who is in the background, still pressed against the glass, aghast)
I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You know (does the motion for the check) Check, Check. Unless the waiter isn't too shape then you gotta total it up. Sometimes they come over, "Do you want the check?" No I wanna be pen pals, can't you see what I'm doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people.
(on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV for another minute) The letter, that's the letter!
And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.
Well its not like it's a really funny story or anything.
(to George) So did you bring the lease? (George takes the lease from his inside pocket and hands it to Jerry.) All right, gee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time.
She's makin' the three o'clock train.
Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that?
Kramer, outta the car. Out, now!
George?
I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal?
Try me.
Well, ...
Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
Well, I'm calling this off right now.
Yeah, well, until this bill is paid...
it can't be
Thats the bet! That youre not doing it!
Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency.
Why would he steal a box of raisins?
So, she got you to join a book club?
This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.
I like the way you think.
Fine.
He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.
Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business thing...
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.
What is your problem?
Hi.
Uncle Leo! What are you doing here?
Oh, they're all the same. Here. [gives him Dust Buster] Now if you'll excuse us, ..
So the door was wide open?
Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.
Why?
We're straightening out!
This thing has never worked right. (holding the machine in his hand)
So what's going on with Simon? Did he leave?
Hey, there's the old man! (hug)
Another Caf Latte?
What's with you?
Oh yeah, I knew.
(Slow whispering) This is a nightmare.
Male roommate, huh?
(leafing through his mail) Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.
You dont think that I killed her?
The Jews?
Hey. Hey, Mickey. What's going on?
C'mon! One whiff!
'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off the table.
Yeah, so do you. (George enters with a newspaper.)
Well, it was the best of those movies.
Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.
What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him?
Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?
So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?
Sure.
Hello?
Ohh. Hey, how you feeling?
It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?
Come on, take them. You could take Bonnie.
So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.
Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits on a couch.) Hey, what about this one?
(Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the 80s, and its still relatable today.
Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...
To the Idiotmobile!
Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.
Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!
All right. Flush twice.
There's really not that much to tell.
But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!
So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?
Really good.
Yeah.
You what?
No, me either.
Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?
Uh, nuthin'. Then he took me home.
Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?
So, you're actually considering it?
Bye.
Thats what you want to see, yeah. . . . Yeah, you want to trade your hair for some phlegm.
You had a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with my butler?
Ok.
Oh, come on.
You're returning used fruit?
Especially that big kid up in the front. (Mr. Pitt is shown on the television, trying to hold up the deflating Woody balloon.) How old is he? (The phone rings.) Hello?
Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?
(Smiling, like a salesman) All right. Now, what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today?
Kramer?
How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go.
I'm telling and you can't stop me!
This could only happen to you.
The crepe place?
Fix a screen door in Queens.
I don't have to be funny, I don't care.
(to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?
Right upstairs.
Good morning.
"The Velvet fog?"
Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this? (moves his arm) He's gonna think you're a mental patient.
Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.
Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.
That Pam! I am ga-ga over her!
Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?
Alright, alright. I'll wake 'em up.
No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?
That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.
All right, then. I'll see you later.
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em. (starts backing away as Kramer follows him around the room carrying the underwear)
I'm not sending you the bill.
Sid left the keys in the car.
Prognosis *negative*!?
How can you think of food at the time like this?
I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.
"What are you doing that for, you got a job"
Ahh.
Did you find out who stabbed him?
What do we got?
No the stools go over there.
Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. (To Kramer) I never should have cashed those checks!
All right.
Yes.
You mean golf?
Hey Kenny. (with some fake enthusiasm, just to be polite)
Sorry about the Olympics.
Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I would've asked her.
Where did you get all these?
Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!
(answering phone) Y'hello.
And he didn't remember you?
I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.
(His thoughts) I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver.
Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?
Stop your crying will ya?
We haven't spoken.
Some new kind of pie.
You're throwin' this out??
I dont even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, Ive met them three times in my life.
First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.
Alright. (Jerry opens the door for George)
Yeah, so I didn't miss anything?
(dismissing) Yeah, right.
I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles.
Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.
No. Jacket and tie no cape.
I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you dont have to be home on time.
So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.
NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.
What're you gonna do?
If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.
I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .
No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe it. I lost him. That stupid idiot. Now what are we going to do?
Thank you.
Yeah, you're right.
Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?
I mean, every time I see him, it's Tony this, Tony that. George is like a school girl around him
(Modest) Oh, you know, the usual..
So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist. You just called the woman for a date.
The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.
You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!
Momentum - same thing.
So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.
Im good, thanks.
I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?
Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.
All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.
Kramer, (Trying to pass him) get outta my way!
I did.
I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.
So what are you gonna do?
You're just straightening up or you're cleaning?
George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'
Ma.
No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.
Yeah, but it never works.
(to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)
Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?
Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)
Oh my...
I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...
What?
Yeah, but with you it's intentional.
(Pointing) But are you still master of your domain?
A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business.
I'm telling you.
Let's ask him.
Yeah, and Poppie's got problems...
I've never had a job.
Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.
Your good friend is morbidly obese.
(Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.
I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight....
Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one.
Yeah, I know.
What does that mean?
Yeah, I heard.
Well. Well.
Yeah, he just walked by.
Just, uh, plop it on the counter there.
(downcast) Oh, I'm sorry.
What about if youre not around?
Restaurants too?
So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?
Well why doesn't he just come in?
Drop dead?
You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?
I don't need a reason to give gifts, it's my nature. I love to make people happy.
Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.
It's a tell. You gotta tell.
No?
(Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.
I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night only, the big screen. My hands are tied!
I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me "C'mon Jerry, go along, go along..."
Tub is love.
Bye.
I don't like pesto.
Nope. I don't think so.
Nina?
(Thinks) What does she say...?
So he's Bizarro Jerry!
I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?
Well you said they could come and take the records.
You loaned her Pitt's racquet?
Woodhaven.
I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.
How ya doin'?
Wouldnt it be great if you could ask a woman what shes thinking?
Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. (Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks at Kramer.)
Well, what about my car?
Thank you.
Revenge date? That sound like you more than me.
(to Kramer) Hold on a second. (to Morty) Hiya dad.
Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?
Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?
Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?
Kind of a Yankee prom?
And if you do?
Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss.
Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this uh considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check?
Oh, hello.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.
(Singing) Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!
Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go.
You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.
Hello. Oh! Hi George.......What! ..really! All right I'll call Elaine , we'll meet you down there.
Oh, my God...
So you do want it.
(leaving) Konichi-wa.
Me? Godfather?
Same as you cant overwet. You see, once something is wet, its wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die youre dead, right? Lets say you drop dead and I shoot you. Youre not gonna die again, youre already dead. You cant overdie, you cant overdry.
Lloyd?
(to George) Did you call me a wuss?
(whining like Kramer) Ask Newman.
Pretty lucky to find this hotel, Jean-Paul.
He didn't make it.
No, I kinda tried to test his hearing.
You're an idiot.
Yeah. Let's go.
You like full lips.
What's he doing? What is his hurry?
We do what we can.
There he is. He's going into that bar.
She could have mentioned the conversation.
(indicates the bowl of cereal) No milk?
Yes, it's very strange. Very strange.
No, she's not.
(to the intercom) Elaine?
Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.
You all right?
[mockingly] "Please hurry". Look at you. Look at what you've become.
Well , now I'm engaged..
Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.
But you could?
Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.
Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you?
Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something.
You're right. My fault.
You're going to do something about it?
Hello? Hello?
Okay, I think you're in love!
Oh...yeah...uh you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.
Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income.
Drop one. . . . left!
I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?
Uh-ha.
Hey.
(smug) I'm not engaged.
Newman!
Well it?s very flattering. How did you get these tickets, I heard they're impossible to get.
Hey you guys!
Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy.
So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?
Is getting married!
Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist enters Monk's)
I just wanna call the police!
Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!
He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.
(Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.
Because I was standing here, that?s why.
It's okay, that's not bad.
Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.
Still got it.
Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.
Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?
Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!
Uh huh.
(Out of it) Yeah, good morning.
C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something.
What about me?
To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go "Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch." According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.
Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.
I thought your mother's paying for it.
Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.
Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.
Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so fuck(bleeped)ing good.
Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?
Bazooka Joe.
Your off-Broadway play.
Well, Gail Cunningham.
Assman!
Who goes to the hospital to rest?
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What?
What's that?
Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)
Which part? The renovating the restaurant you dont own part or spending the two hundred million you dont have part?
No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car.
Ma, you cant look up words in the dictionary! (to Morty) Dad, shes cheating!
Yes I do, Kramer.
(pause. Stops tapping his leg) 'scuse me?
But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.
(Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell smoke?
(Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) I didn't say anything.
Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.
All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.
Yeah, it's no big deal.
No T-bone?
What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.
(to Kramer) You left the door open?!
Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!
No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?
Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?
Who's Cartwright?
Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!
Stinks!
Alright I'm going.
Ask George to go with you.
Okay.
Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.
You're racing!
And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.
(confused) Dinner? W..What time is it?
Yeah.
yeah,
Oh. (chuckles) Really? You don't seem that desperate.
You can be bleak in spring.
Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?
Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.
Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.
(pause) Not comfortable... (gets up again)
What happened?
Kramer, you're fighting children?!
I was kind of um (pauses) making out.
Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.
So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?
Stuff.
Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
The dog? The dog??
(sits up in bed) Oh what...
Yeah.
Huh? How you feeling?
No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o.
So take a cab.
(pause, to Donna) You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name...
You got Danny Tartabull?!
If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.
Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.
Hey Barry, how you doing?
(To Puddy) Ill be right back.
Well, her belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) Im bored. Talk to me.
She's got 'it' written all over her.
Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.
Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
Maybe they've all been faking.
(Also guessing) Crook eye?
Mulva.
Shower?
Hey.
He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.
You know it seems impossible.
So, maybe they had Chinese food?
I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.
Yeah, you, me and George.
Binaca?
Go on.
Just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces Kramer) Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!
If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.
Yeah, he's a bad seed.
Yeah,, me too.
Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person -
(Disgusted) What is with that?!
I'm in the middle of a story.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Well, I got to talk her out of this.
You know what room Testikov's in?
(Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in.
Do you wanna fight?
(trying to shut the trunk hood) Something wrong with this trunk.
Let's check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil.
Two.
Be careful.
Yeah, I started out real classy...
Why did you force that mint on me? I told ya I didn't want the mint!
We're doing fine. How are you?
What are you talking about?
Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.
That's not that?
(Unsure of what to say - he remember's Leo's courtesy tip) Hello?
But they not you arent handicapped, arent you ashamed?
Its a joke.
Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with you?
Youre gone all right.
"Looks like he gave you some Novocaine"
There's more than a couple.
Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.
Oh, yeah, that. Well...
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.
Fluff and Fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.
Its tremendous.
This is what you gonna wear?
What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy?
It's not good.
Impossible, right?
No! Dry-cleaned.
Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I dont feel comfortable in them.
Hi Elaine, this is Angela.
I cannot take it!
Tough day at the office?
Its partially you, yeah.
Wait a second, I--
Well, so what if I said that?
Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.
Define rarely.
He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about "Jerry."
Of course its a sliding scale.
Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.
Wait, that's you?
(Joking around) Hey, didn't I beat you up in the fourth grade?
Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?
So what?
Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it?
You're a shmoopy!
Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestl's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--
It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.
Yes, I poo-poo.
You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.
So forget about your clothes.
How do I look?
Come on up.
Excuse me, uh...dentist? You a dentist? (The guy shakes his head. Jerry moves on to another guy.) Dentist? Are you a dentist?
Really?
What?
(A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.
Ah...catalog writer's block?
She went out to get her head shaved.
Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.
Oh, I don't want to bother you.
What do you make of it?
Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.
Let me explain something to you. You see, youre not normal. Youre a great guy, I love you, but youre a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldnt understand.
Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.
Hey.
He wont take ya..
Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.
Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..
Make them interesting.
We'll see about that. (Runs to the window and shouts up to Kramer, who's on the roof.) Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win!
Hello? Who's this?
So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?
I'm goin' home.
So how'd you hit the car?
She's too good.
Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up!
Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.
That's it! No more questions! I don't care!
Kramer, bumper-cars?
I can tell you what to think.
Hey Alec
Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?
..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.
You're going to see Genderson?
Hello?
Laura.
So, you play tennis?
You really want to?
Yeah and...?
You're crazy.
But I changed my mind..
(Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.
Then how'd you get up there?
Not everybody likes everybody!
Is that so?
I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?
No, its not that. It wasnt all one-sided.
I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
Yes I did.
All right.
Who?
Would you tell Susan about it?
Yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder)
Look! I don't want 'em!
As you see it?
You faked it? Why would you do that?
I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a riot.
Yeah, yeah I did.
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?
Ah ... let's call it even.
Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?
Thank you.
Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table)
Sort of a mooching inventory.
Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,
What did you have to give your TV away to George for?
I think you know my policy.
Hello?
Half of show business is here.
You know what? No champagne. Anyway. . . I'll see you later.
And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my...
Oh, you think I'm lying about this?
Why didn't you come up with your own?
(Pulls a small bottle out of his pocket) Uh-huh. Hey, look what they had on the plane. Schnapps.
Take the K-man. A little support..
Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.
Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
What show?
George, Marla.
He can't hear us.
All right Newman, one more peep outta you, you're out of the whole operation!
Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Right. I am.
What happened?
Who?
Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!
She's not really the naked type.
Hi Cosmo.
Name tags?
George, George!
It's Dolores.
Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.
Can I make it up to you? Ill give you fifty bucks for the jug.
You don't even know what paba is.
(Gestures to his forehead) Youre getting that vein again.
Didn't you explain that to the cop?
Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?
Of course he did ..The guy's working ya.
Alright, alright.
No, I don't.
Oh, oh take it back. Let's get another one.
Ten minutes.
I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from.
What are you talking about? I bombed!
You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.
Hi.
Marlene.
(Stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. (Approaches the intercom) C'mon, let's get it together.. (Through intercom) Yeah?
129 West 81st street.
Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.
Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)
Am I finally getting a baby brother?
Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I'm sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.
(Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled "Ori-dent") Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!
Say something funny.
No. I'm not really looking.
So I said something.
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.
tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.
Keep following him Kramer. don't let me down.
It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.
Ill have the salmon.
I've never been called breathtaking either.
I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.
Really? Her mother.
I cant. Im on my way out. Theres no way I can do it.
Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.
Oh it's a fascinating field!
He wants me to help him move.
Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?
Gay?
One of the problems in life is that when youre a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, I got the front seat I wanted the front seat! I called it. And the other kid knows hes got nothing to say He called it. What can I do? If there was a Kid Court Of Law, it holds up. Your Honour, my client did ask for the front seat And the judge would go, Did he call it? Well no, he didnt call- BANG! (Jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled.
What's stopping them?
You're just answering phones!
(to the phone) George, whats going on?!
You play a *Hell* of a piano.
They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
Is this my stereo?
Uh, no. Should I have?
Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)
Yeah.
Maybe you're getting' a raise.
George, I am loving this no wallet thing.
It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. "It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad." But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, "I refuse to put any thought into this at all." Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?
All right. That's it, I can't work like this.
You certainly are. What's going on?
Your pants!
Yeah, dont investigate, dont pay me back, it was an accident.
For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.
Yeah.
Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this.
Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that.
Oh, I'm paying for breakfast?
Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?
Yeah.
Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth.
You got evens.
Drakes Coffee Cake
Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?
Why?
It's All-Tempa-Cheer.
Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.
(To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom buzzes) That's Elaine. (Kramer buzzes her in. Jerry talks into the phone) Kramer.. (To Kramer) George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.
(walking towards door with Elaine) How long did you last? (opens door)
Doofus?
No. We gotta go to the soup place.
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.
What are ya gonna do?
That's the *least* of what you've accomplished...
Why?
Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didnt want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And its been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. (to Kramer) All right, so, just take what you want and lets get it out of here.
The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.
-programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'
Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket.
Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?
In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.
Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.
Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.
What car?
Did he take 'em?
She said she'll do it.
Kramer!!
Hey look at you.
C'mon I need it.
You cant do that.
Well, I like Gabe Kaplan.
That, that's tomato juice.
I know, but I'm distracted now.
Heeeey!
Hi.
Are you okay?
Alright.
That is out there.
I really think you're making too much of this.
Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead.
You can't. That's why they lose very few players.
Where?
So, did these thieves want any money?
I Love you.
You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.
Jerry, You want to pick her up?
Yes, so people are just dialing it by mistake and getting you.
Don't you see?...........It's all a big scam.
Why? I'll tell you why.
Good. Whats the matter?
Well, uh..
I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?
Hey, look, there's Bobby Eighteen?s father-in-law, Mr Reichman. George and I were just talking about that today, I can?t believe it! That?s the guy who threw George out of the wedding.
You don't want any of this?
No. So, we're still on to see uh, Firestorm tonight?
Is there, something I can help you with?
I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...
Yeah...my wife.
I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.
She's good looking.
Hey, where have you been?
You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.
(Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?
All right.
(walking away) Yeah, I'll see ya'.
Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.
Not because youre dirty, not because youre clean  just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine...
No no no. No dinner.
His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I wouldve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. Hes so self-involved.
I sound funny?
Game?
Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing...
Uh-huh.
Everything all right?
Hey, shall we spit on him?
All right, lets go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.
You stink worse than I do!
Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?
All right. Come on sit down. It's about to start.
Oh, hey Mike.
(Moving back into the living room) Okay.
Levels?
What press?
You didn't give that thing back?
I'm not gay.
What's that on your forehead?
(on phone) But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.
How did you know?
Is there a box spring?
Bye.
No, no Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.
Look, she's cutting up an Almond Joy.
Crazy like a man.
No.
(bewildered) Four-thirty? Who eats dinner at four-thirty?
Can I have my keys...
Are you nuts? You dont even know the guy.
Well, well, why are you getting rid of your refrigerator? (he gets up from the table and carries a dish into the kitchen)
So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.
How could she not tell me where she was staying?
Neither have I.
And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She says, "That's funny." ... That's funny!
The big toe; The captain.
So what? What would they care?
(advancing on Gary) ...and he told me that that... (becomes indistinct)
Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, "You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"
The buzzer.
Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city.
(hands it to him as he asks ELAINE) So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?
Ya, see ya.
Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.
When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their face, you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going with somebody.
Flowers?
Grandma Memma?
Can you get me a soda?
You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!
No. Things pop into your head. You?
(joyless) Yeah, yes.
Prognosis Negative.
I was saying the same thing.
I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.
Actually I am quite comfortable.
But I don't want any "sweet action."
Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.
You like that commercial?
Somehow I thought he'd be taller.
Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.
Is that it?
Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.
Good idea. (phone's ringing, goes to it) (muttering) There's a beach towel on the rack.. (to phone) Yeah.
Paul again?
But you did actually throw his coat out the window.
Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?
(thinking) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft... (to Vanessa) Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit.
That is a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. Some guy from NBC saw my set, he wants me to do a showcase. I might have another shot at a pilot.
By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine)
oh..huh.. is she coming up?
All right, very funny. I get it.
What, did you lose your remote?
It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.
It doesn't work like that.
That's shocking, but sounds ...
How ya doing? (George nods) Can't talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his brace) Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his eyebrows) I like that. (George sticks his tongue out) So how's life without tonsils? (George quickly indicates with his arm that he wants ice cream) What? What's that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?.. (George signals that it's more) Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy.. (George motions for ice cream again) What are you doing?
Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?
Well how did he react when you gave it to him?
No, see, we didnt have ponies. Im sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..
Well, what street are you on?
Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want? You're not a part of society.
I love the day date. No wine, No shower.
Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!
Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.
(CONT'D) What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.
Um, you know, its the damnedest thing. It went away.
Youre still thinking about this?
Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine.
Oh, stop it.
What is that?
Just imagine how much more you'll accomplish.
And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.
How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!
(What's goin' on,) like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--
(answering) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Um, its for you.
(picking at his moustache) You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.
Hey! Greg
Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?
What look? Nothing.
Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, Yeah, I got this new thing Platonic. My idea, my name, callin it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- dont do anything, and go right home. Whatd you think? I think its going to be big! I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didnt work. Yknow, I bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, Uh, Hi, uh my names Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, its a Riconic relationship.
All right.
What about a plastic bag?
(pause) If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?
Whoa!
(Shocked) You're telling me.
Oh, lithe!
Hi how are you?
Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?
No, I do not like the bank. Ive heard the expression Laughing all the way to the bank. I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when theres nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, its empty and you still have to go through the little maze. (walking on the stage like he is going through a maze) Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? Im almost at the front. Id like a reward for this please.
Defent.
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me
So, how did you get up there? Did you say you had to use the bathroom?
Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy.
Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.
Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.
Oh who made you a Mohel? Whadya, get your degree from a matchbook?
This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!
(suspicious) Well, then what're you doing?
(talking to Beth on the phone) Could you put him on, I'd love to say hello.
You know, we never had one fight before this deal.
(seeing Elaine enter Monk's) Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body?
No, Poppie! No!!
Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?
But I went to the funeral.
You don't think...?
I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good things.
Good body.
On your mothers life?
I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? (Kramer holds a broken Tony)
How can I take it?
Are you through?
Oh I dont know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing.
Thats her! Shes here!
What?
Seven-eleven?
Big accomplishment.
What's the difference?
I know Finland. Theyre neutral.
Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio.
So is this a breakup/quitting?
Read it out loud.
Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night.
12 gauge. Seems to be the most popular gauge.
You know my parents are coming in and I got some clean up to do , so if you and Potsie are done scheming....
Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour.
It was a so-so sorry.
Yeah, yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. Would you mind. I'd like to take the picture back.
Bob.
Yeah, me too.
(defensive) I didn't ruin your business.
I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.
Ma, it's not true!
Kramer, you're still on the phone?
What the hell is this?
...I got you an apartment in this building.
Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up...
If my father was moving this hed had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (as his father) 'Have you got your end?...Your ends got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your ends got to come down.'
I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg." But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, "Would you mind?!"
Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?
There are ways.
Oh. It's back.
You got the job?
Yes, clothes. This is normal.
Ah, she's with her friend Wendy.
Well, where are you going?
Alright. Forget it.
Ma, I told you, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan... Okay, bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Rava) My mother. She forgot how to make French toast. You know how mothers are.
Well, look at this guy. Look, hes got everything, hes got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners.  This is not his first load.
Shell be furious.
Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!
You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. (with a British accent) "Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you".
Youre already moping! Would you take the place?
No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!
George, did you get that chair yet?
No.
"No... I find them repugnant and unappealing."
You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.
What? Can't I get a moment's peace?
Well, I'll think about it...
Yeah... hes specializing in whales. He's working on lowering the cholesterol level, in whales all that blubber -- quite unhealthy. You know its the largest mammal on earth but as George says "they don't have to be."
How is she?
Y'know a lot of people have asked that...
..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Packyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of (wipes his brow) pizza and uh the uh and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling em (does juggling motions) he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. (Swallows and takes a breath) Well we all just lost it. (Fulton not laughing, stone faced) It was really really funny.
(to George) Again with the sweat pants?
Aahh!
All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter)
Like a grandmother, why?
They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?
Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing. Perhaps it's an homage.
All right. All right.
Oh that's an old wives tale.
... if this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this woman to help me I would have killed this man. I would have strangled the life out of him with my bare hands
Just . . . do it.
I thought I smelled lilac.
(Chuckles) You don't know the half of it.
You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.
C'mon Ponytail ...Get real.
No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.
Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?
I know.
Why can't I be a soul mate?
He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.
Have you ever heard of egg salad?
Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated.
All right, biff. Elaine, merry-go-round?
"Adults only?"
So, the free love buffet is over?
(Banging the phone against the booth) Elaine!
Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.
What do you say?
Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.
From what?
No, no, not at all.
(adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.
How did it happen?
(disbelief) Milos?
I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.
Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?
Well "six" and "sex" are close.
Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office
If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.
You dont have to say Wow. I know its Wow. (Kramer smiling) And theres that smile again. Well, what is that? (Intercom buzzes.) Its George.
Nothing.
Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log.
What made him get that thing?
You went all night?
Im not taking it back.
Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.
I know the point.
The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves)
Nah, don't bother.
Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here!
Howard Metro.
Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department.
How could you not care?
Go back.
Bad? (Elaine nods.) Very bad?
Ahhh...The Day..
That seems about right.
Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises?
How do you oversleep at the Olympics...?
Lloyd.
Not today, pal.
Nah, I don't wanna
So why didn't you tell her the code?
Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?
Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
Gimme ten.
You told Testikov, (Elaine nods) that Tolstoy wanted to name his book "War-- What Is IT Good For?"?
We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
(Confused) What are you talking about?
Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.
Hey, what happened to your coat? And what is the smell? Is-ya, What are you drunk?
Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.
Uncle Leo?
Yeah well King Edward didnt live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.
That's why I poked.
Id really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.
So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?
Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
I'm sorry.
Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting. I'd have to get new friends. I'd have to get orgy friends. ... Naw, I'm not ready for it.
Yeah.... well Elaine.
(aghast) Four in the morning?!
Hey, Al.
Why'd you have to eat so many?
You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.
Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?
Are you sure? Oh boy, here we go.
Your hair, its somewhat de-poofed.
You would turn me in?
Yeah. She would love cashmere.
"You find you need to use a lot of obscenities at the dentist.
She's okay.
No.
Who couldn't.
Yeah. Why?
George
The *beach*?
My parents are moving back too!
She died.
I'm right here. (note he has an athletic bandage on his right hand) You're late.
Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.
Five minutes.
...Guys?
You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. (Phone rings, he answers it) Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend.
Uh?
George??
Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...yknow, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, its dark, theres bubbles happening, theyre all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, Cmon babe, lets go. You come by, you open up the lid and theyll- (stiffens up, as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, theyre in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, Tomorrow, the dryer, Im goin. You wait here! The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you dont see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So theyre showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isnt your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first.
There's no watch ... I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep good time. My parents gave it to me, but I didn't like it. So don't mention it again, okay!
What is going on out there?
What happened to you?
Kind of in the middle of something here, George.
Hey, hey. uh Pamelas birthday party, didnt I see you there? Jerry.
What date? It's a GUY.
Why not?
(Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.
Do you not like apple pie?
(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.
But there's no "t" in your name. What about G-bone?
(in a hurry) Yea you're leaving at three o'clock.
Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo.
No, it's a nine-hundred S. (happy) It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo!
You mean like.. (points to his hair)
No. I think it's Demi. (the "i" sounds like an "e")
Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, you were right. I'll do anything!
Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel.
Or something. Yeah, that's a date.
Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."
No, nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table)
My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on. (Kramer enters with a bucket and starts filling it with water on the sink) Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.
I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.
What?
No, he didn't use 'man'.
Yeah, but why would you... (Kramer is eating a peach then disgusted he spits it out) Bad peach?
Where are you going?
Well, not exactly.
Ok, see you later.
Hey, guess what? The Drake broke up.
Not a Federal record.
All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff.
You are NOT sending me fifty dollars!
I'm not kidding.
Were you crying? I mean, its just a grape. Youll find it.
. . . I can't.
Hey, George!
(to George) That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.
You should've had some eggs.
I'm sorry, Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen)
(Continuing reading) "The Human Fund. Money for people."
I can't wear these!
(matter-of-factly) Youre engaged.
Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off.
Move it! Move it! Get going!
uh, well I can't help you there (weakly).
I better not.
You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't remember anything about you.
Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?
What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?
Are you serious?
Lainy!
Nothing.
Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.
Absolutely. Nikki!
Yeah! So
Hot out.
He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. "I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"
No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.
As good as it gets.
See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.
(handing his dad a gift) Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.
That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's.
So George, how do I beat this lie detector?
You saw her? What was she wearing?
Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?
Yeah.
Yes!!!
Well this is very awkward.
Oh, you think she was refunding?
I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.
That. (pointing at George)
C'mon.
So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh?
No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.
So......Susan's dead.....
Its a bet.
I don't want one.
What?
So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.
Right.
Medium crab bisque.
What you must understand, Elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) Youve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.
Ah, non-smoking would be great.
Be careful Kramer.
Please, don't make me beg.
I do favors.
All right, all right. Whats the big hubbub, bub?
Yeah, its some place down in the village.
No, no. I'll take the subway.
Wasn't that kind of important?
(thinking) Great. Thanks.
She suggested it!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.
Thank you, thanks.
Come on up.
Thanks.
Hey, uncle Leo.
Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.
Oh my god! Look what's goin' on here! She is depraved! (Grabs a towel and brings it to Lena.) There you are.
What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?
No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.
This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...
Oh! (hitting George)
By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.
Hello?
I-I-I don't like the opera. What are they singing for? Who sings? You got something to say, say it!
Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.
Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?
Uh, just my next door neighbor.
Talk show host. That's good.
Women need to like the job of the guy theyre with. If they dont like the job, they dont like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. Well, right now, Im the regional management supervisor. Im in development, research, consulting... Men on the other hand  if they are physically attracted to a woman  are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men dont really care. Menll just go, Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? Youre just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why dont you shower up, and well get some burgers and catch a movie.
You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.
how can u say things like that over the phone?
Well, then Im not going to the game either. Okay? Ill give him both tickets.
Hey, isn't that George's father?
What's the difference?
So just start it.
Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.
I dont have any plants.
Hey!
(to Kramer) ...( words missing)...laugh , everything's nice and at the end of the night I go for a little contact. I get the PULL BACK. This woman said the filthiest things I've ever heard in my life. I get the Pull Back.
Oh, this is ridiculous.
(as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.
I don't know. It must be love.
Tremendous girl.
What is it?
Tough one. You're call.
Hey, George!
"I dunno. He's so strange.'
Hey you know we were just talking about you.
Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!
How 'bout the march out?
Alright, then just get rid of it. You wont have any problem.
(to Kramer) What are you doing here?
You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store.
Well maybe he's got like a, cheerful mental hold on you.
But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.
If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like Lex Luthor.
If there's a serial killer lose in your neighborhood, it seems like the safest thing is to be the neighbor. They never kill the neighbor. The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right? "Oh, he was kind of quiet." I love these neighbors. They're never disturbed by the sounds of murdering, just stereo. Chain saws, people screaming, fine. Just keep the music down. And all these women who always fall in love with the serial killer. They write to him in prison. Here's a woman that's hard to disappoint. I guess she's only upset when she finds out he's stopped killing people and she goes "You know sometimes I feel like I don't even know who you are anymore".
You live on this floor?
Hey, woahoh Fulton. It's me.
No.
So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?
(Reading from his notebook) I got You enter, you go "Hi", and I go, "Hello." Now.. we need something here..
Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted.
That's what's so fascinating.
You have an airtight case!
We'll pull up another chair.
Cranberry juice?
Oh no, where's the blood? (opens the fridge) It's in here isn't it?
Were going. Thats next Wednesday.
Hey. It's you! (pointing) Th..that's my Friars Club jacket!
Oh yeah, I know.
just press it
(looks round) Don't worry, I'll get you out.
So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.
Hello.
No, its not that.
It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
Oh, Paul, could you hold that door...
Good, good. You remember George.
No, Nothing.
A few stitches? I've never had stitches. I'll be deformed. I can't live with that. It goes against my whole personality. It's not me!
What is this?
Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.
Check the pile.
Kramer's Andre, he's fooling around with these 976 numbers (Kramer walks out of the bedroom) hey I told you, I don't want you doing that on my phone
Babu, may I say something?
What?
The cleaners? How did it get there?
Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.
What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?
No, don't cancel it.
(Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.
Super bowl! Hey, an original G.I. Joe. (picks up both items) With a full frogman suit.
I did something stupid.
What are you doing?
Inside the van?
What?
Who are you describing?
No, but ah, seen any good movies lately?
Oh.
I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.
"Why?"
Ah ha.
Why??
What happened to the jacket. Did he take it with him?
Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!
But you were supposed to get me a refund.
Franco?
Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to begin with! Let's face it. I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's that!
Come on.
Well good night.
The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the other -person.
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..
Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it.
(thinking) Thank you, Pamela! (turns to talk to Vanessa; to Vanessa) So, youre a lawyer...
Why do you even need anybody?
Yeah.
We're gonna have to talk about this later. (Elaine holds the door open for Jerry while holding her leg) Thank you. Taxi!
Yeah.
I don't know, you know, what if...?
You're going to start your own charity?
Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do some TV spots for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store. That was Leapin' Larry himself, I'm gonna meet with him tomorrow.
Yeah.
He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV.
Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room, searching for the TV.) ELAINE!
I thought your parents were outta town?
Oh, right, right.
I can't. I'm not an orgy guy.
What the hell is going on here?
Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, "Those aren't buoys." (Father starts laughing) Father...
(answering the phone) Hello? Yeah, the van is still for sale. Sure, come on buy.
I mean that's fine if that's who you are...
There you go.
I think Ive played there.
Yes, its my lifes work.
Oh.
Why don't you just have him paged?
Why can't I be normal?
Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.
Never.
Shes subletting Carols place for a month.
How long did you leave it up there?
Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.
Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!
Yes, we do.
Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.
Where are your pants?
Who?
In other words, a normal relationship.
What stuff?
That's a shame.
Never mind
Friend!
[forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell out of here!
Sure, how much?
He was starin' at some woman!
Duncan Meyers!
Good for you.
Uh huh, what's that?
Bania?
Oh, come on!
No, I don't think so.
What about the label maker?
I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.
What do you need a hammer for?
We'll stay in a hotel tonight.
Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats right behind the glass?
I'll be back on Monday.
What would you say if I told you that...
Hello.
But I could do that and the music.
(Agreeing) Yeah, we should.
You tell me.
No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!
One message. Hope it's not from you.
What's the matter with you?
We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?
The Jujy Fruits?
Well, you gotta wean.
Oh no.
Really? (They start to make out, Jerry sees the pilot on the plane) Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!
Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?
I'm sorry.
Up state! Hummm.
He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?
Well I, I can't believe this. I know Phil, he, he's a good friend of mine. We play softball together. How could this be?
Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)
I think the phone is ringing.
Hi, Beth!
So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building?
Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!
Done.
'Maybe'!?
That smells good, what is that?
Why? Why are they doing that?
And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises.
I think you said driver.
What?
But that's not what she thinks.
I don't know.
That woman is absolutely stunning.
(dry) He knows.
Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend.
Is not.
Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.
What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?
That's an open-lip kiss, alright.
No.
Okay. I'll get it. (Goes into the bedroom.)
Three.
My Indian?
How much did you wound up tipping her?
Really? How late are they open?
George, big news; I'm getting married!!
It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.
Hey.
That's the idea.
In case of what?
Well you can't take her maybe you can't take me either.
Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'
Really?
He took It, Out?
And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?
Maybe.
That?
Yes, he is.
(Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really?
Ya. (hits the button, opens the door. To Elaine) Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys.
A Willard? Saccamano, Sr. screwed me!
(looking at her) How about that.
You don't mean here?
Come on up.
I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?
(to the phone) Hello?
Oh, well, of course. Nineteen-seventy-three.
What?
Understand you had a little talk with him too.
Ooh yeah, the bags, sure.
Towards what end?
They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
What?
Oh, it was nothing.
I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? (Kramer comes in) A real dermatologist.
Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss.
Pretty good. I think she might be the one.
I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.
How soft?
We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.
Really?
Well I'll get them.
Yeah.
I had to do it.
Please.
Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.
How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?
Hey. Could I use your shower?
You could take it? You want it?
Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.
Well it's been quite a night I could sure use a cup of coffee.
Nice to see you. This is Elaine.
Remember David Puddy?
Well, I think the whole thing stinks.
(calm) I ordered in. It's still effort.
Hi
Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.
She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass.
Yeah. a-hu. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?
I have to do what?
I hear things.
You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?
So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--
Just break up with him?
Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.
Yes. A bubble boy.
So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?
I...don't remember.
Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is.
There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?
Me? Why me?
Absolutely.
Well, she is a woman.
It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
Oh yeah, right.
Out.
Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.
Your core temperature?
Alright.
They make wigs out of human hairs?
(Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
That's right, the Bubble Boy.
George's father.
Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman anything you say she does!
(shaking his head no) No Kramer I don't want to talk to him.
So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought.... And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me.
Elaine, let the man make his soup!
Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.
What about your sea sickness?
Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.
A uh, one of those guys.
I dont think so.
(hopeful) Then you admit it was amusing?
And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now.
Stay on Biscayne.
What is his name?
(to Kramer) Who is it?
Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....
(Jokingly playing off Kramer's statement) With a different body.
Well you should tell her.
Hi.
Really? I thought things were going OK.
I don't mind the Mayans.
Who?
Hi Evelyn.
Hey, Ronnie.
Oh uh ...
You can go with Kramer
Alright, sit down, sit down. (Grabs a pill from the bottle, and starts advancing tward Kramer - like an owner with his dog)
"Guys And Dolls"? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?
I'm with you.
(whispers) Haymen, Are you sure?
I don't know, but we don't have much time.
Hi!
Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?
Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort?
Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.
Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?
I'm having surgery tomorrow.
Do medical schools actually do this?
Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?
So, what did you say?
He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.
(whispers) Damn.
I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble. I'll do it myself.
All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now, be reasonable you cannot turn down $50 for a $6 rye.
Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.
Hi Louise...
(Getting up) Alright, big work day.
You know how they do that?
She's a virgin, she just told me.
The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. "Who was that clown?", "I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?", "The guy's a clown!". How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, "What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!"
yeah, yeah.
Come on. Then you dont have to see him again til my 15,000-mile check.
How did they find Babu?
Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.
So what's this job?
Did he call you last night?
No
Elaine...
No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?
I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.
Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry won't let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesnt that bother you?
Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?
I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.
Oh, I'm sure you do.
Get outta here.
Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again.
Yeah, yeah, alright.
Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners.
"You're turning in to Jimmy."
You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? When I'm on stage that's all I hear; You stink, You suck. We like magic.
Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.
(on phone) Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil.
Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'
What are you doing here?
Back on the rack.
My car!
That's a date.
Where do you *get* this?
He's not after me.
Another babka?
You mugged Stephen Hawking?
I love Yoo Hoo.
Good, as a matter of fact. I almost had my own show in Japan.
Peach.
I know isn't that something?
What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?
Really?
So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?
Absolutely. Let's just stick around.
The tap is tough.
Oh. (Intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it) Yeah?
Always works?
All of a sudden you get hungry?
(to the phone) Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you- Oh, Hi. Joel... Oh, you just came in... Listen, I cant make it to the game tonight... I, uh, have to tutor my nephew... Yeah, hes got an exam tomorrow... Geometry... You know, trapezoids, rhombus... Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. Theyre at the Will-Call window... And Im really sorry... Have a good time... Well talk next week... Okay... Yeah, I dont... Fine.. Fine... Bye.
Trip to Berlin?
Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
So, Kramer pulled it off?
He went crazy from one note. He couldnt get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.
What?
So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?
I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.
Yes, yes, he is.
Are you serious?
The way I feel when I go places with you? (Kramer enters.) Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?
Why would anybody want a friend.
Just keeps on getting better and better.
(deadpan) I think you need more sleep.
Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?
Yeah.
Wow! Joe Pepitone!
You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.
That madman is trying to kill me.
What seems to be the problem, officer?
What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?
Well, I was here, thats everyone (laughing).
"Atomic Sub"? Why are you eating there?
(Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.
I noticed she's big on the phrase "yada yada."
No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?
Well, I just want you to know I'm there for you. Course now I'm here for you, but when i'm not here for you, i'm there for you.
Yeah, see ya. (he hangs up)
They did it for three years. What's another few months.
Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.
What?!
Yeah, that's part of it. (sniffs) Kasha?
Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.
You know what? That was the amazing thing.
Well we're sitting here together. Why wouldn't you think that.
There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.
Yes.
Well now we're gettin' somewhere.
Poppy seeds!
Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.
(Gets up) Get out!
Something to drink?
They deliver wood?
What about Susan?
Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.
All right.
All right, I'm sorry. What about her?
But what about the messages?
Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at no more than three miles an hour.
Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?
(to self) Oh. Twist off..
(Stunned) No, keep it. (Elaine enters the apartment) Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.
(annoyed) Ma, will you go already?
Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?
Yeah, but--
Oh Hi.
All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar).
What did you end up giving her?
Oh, nothing in particular.
I really wanna...
We're behind you, Aquaboy. Godspeed!
Take some of mine.
We were just playin.'
Charity?!? That's apalling.
Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!
What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?
Well, what about Susan?
Im no cat killer.
Kramer dating your room mate. It's funny.
Yeah, I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her.
We found out his super power was lack of money.
No, that's the rule. It's optional.
So all my sneakers are gone?
That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.
On your heart?
Hi Mary.
Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?
Now what did you ask me again.
It would be nice to care about someone.
Where's George now?
And what's gonna happen?
Yeah, I guess I slipped up.
(To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.
It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination. I would have killed this man. Torn him limb from limb, ripped the flesh right off his bones ...
You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.
Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses... I need an awkward pause.
I'll loan you my puffy shirt.
(interrupting) Thanks, that's enough.
Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!
We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.
Hey.
Ah, you know. Im supposed to meet, eh, someone -- Ill, Ill wait for them outside. (walks towards the door)
He took what out?
Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it.
Hard to believe.
All right.
Not if they don't know you...
Oh!
Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.
Yea, that's no good.
I can't figure out what's going on here. I can't follow the plot. Why did they kill that guy? I thought he was with them?
(Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My, isn't this an awkward moment?
No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off.
Well George is an idiot.
(Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.
We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.
Good evening, Rabbi.
Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?
Is this really necessary?
Put it over there.
What, you're considering this?
I don't really have enough room.
Disgusting?
Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine?
He'll dispose of it.
Who is it?
Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)
Hey! Just like you pretend to be.
Alright.
Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs.
Where do you suppose that could've come from?
No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him.
Yeah, Yeah!!
No, she looks completely normal.
Ah, just - takin' a little break.
(impressed) Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.
I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.
On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?
Kramer!
Right.
There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
She sees something in him.
Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.
Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?
Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?
I'm not having money problems.
Ok.
Hakuna Matata?
So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo?
Actually, that's--
I thought you were leaning towards Julie.
Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. (Joel shakes his head agreeing; Jerry smiles) You know, its their annual terrorist luncheon.
Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.
Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.
I've never fixed anybody up.
Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.
You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake.
What is this thing around your neck?
No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.
Did they uncross the lines yet?
At least you'll be talking.
What if we get caught?
So you feel you were short changed.
Well, I dont really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.
Very strange.
Oh, good.
You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...
I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.
Elaine? Wh..what's going on?
Oh yeah.
There's more food down the hall.
"Of course" was the last thing he said?
(to Stella) Her back hurts.
How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?
I dont want cantaloupe now.
Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.
I'm not happy.
Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door.
All right, all right. All right, thats enough! Lets get back to my deal. That undercoating, thats a rip-off, isnt it, David?
It's over?
I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.
Nah, you're crazy anyway.
(to the phone) Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my moneys gone... Well, call me right back. (Jerry hangs up.) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasnt been home or in his office in the past three days!
It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...
So you were with him that day at the track?
I bought him some kishka.
Really?
I don't understand what the big deal is.
Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house?
She knew that.
Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.
I'll be right back. (Leaves the table.)
No.
No, what? What kind is it?
Filks nothing, but 555-FILM is Movie Phone.
A cashmere sweater.
She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.
You wanna go with me up to (clap) the Bronx and see if there's any flyers on George's car.
Let's go.
"Glamour"?
Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something.
Should I?
All right, all right.
(points to George) Ya.
Yep.
Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.
Lloyd?
(Thinking) What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship. Gotta relax.
Defence? Please. ...They need speed.
Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!
OK ... (nodding his head up and down) This is it cha know
[Into intercom] Yes?
There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.
Anklets?
(Starts to correct then realizes) Well...
Yeah.
Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!
Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes.
The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting out that marriage.
(Rejecting) Ohh, no. No, no, no..
No I don't.
So is she working? Is she here?
I wonder what ever happened to her.
Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.
I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood.
What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in it's path.
Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.
What?
Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?
Your father got arrested? For what?
Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.
Bania?
She looked great.
No, shes a little too cheery for me.
See you ... me and Kramer...
(Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there.
(to George) Hey, there's Pat. (calls) Hey, Pat.
So what?
You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?
It's still bleak.
You let him fight?
and that's why you're going out with him
What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display. (takes the peanut butter jar away from George)
You faked it?
(excited) Oh, Hi Beth
What if she's got no interest in you?
(about the massage)You know I think this is really helping.
35, and George, on the invitations...
I mean I met her three times. I dont even know her last name.
Oh, nothing happened, you know, but is was great.
Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both killed!
The Chinese , the Chinese bald cure.
Oh, The Muted Heart. Glen Close. Sally Field. Well, that should be good.
I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.
Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart.
How much?
No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.
Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?
What, you dont want to do this?
Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.
Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.
Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.
And . .
What's your airport route?
No, no. It-It's really funny. There's these two guys-
(impressed) Who's that?
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..
Where?
(moans) Ohhh (walks away)
Adjacent to refuse, is refuse.
Let me get that.
What?
Well Biff/ What's next?
Hello, uncle Leo!
So?
Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.
Cookies don't liquefy.
I can't believe this.
No thanks.
Bye.
I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that? (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying)
I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.
I think we've worked out a system.
They just wanted the armoire?
You don't know?
Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.
Elainell kill me.
Go ahead.
(cont'd) Im gonna do it in Farsi.
Can you relax, its a cup of coffee. Claire is a professional waitress.
He called you?
Pull over? You can't pull over.
I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!
Kramer.
Come on stop.
Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?
(to himself) I have absolutely no idea.
The crook has the machine. The messages arent for him. Hes the crook. Why would he answer- (Jerry gives up on the explanation and turns around to see George standing behind him.) How did you get in here?
I don't know.
Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya doing?
I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all.
Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from ourselves. That's what you said.
I know nothing, but what did you actually do?
Yeah, she's got a big nose.
I never should have made up those rules.
Can you conduct your business elsewhere?
Here we go.
The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
You do of course try on, when you buy?
Well, y..you showed her who you are.
20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.
How can I want it now, if you want it?
All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you double what you paid for it.
Bless you.
Yes, Ill be stopping.
What is it?
Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?
(Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.
1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass!
Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment. How 'bout I make it up to you with dinner?
I don't know if he's mad.
It's on the door.
What happened to Karen?
That's from the car!
Why not?
Yes, I do.
Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!
Yeah, I know how you feel.
All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.
No, I think I would have remembered Memma.
Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you do likewise.
It's a tad dainty.
I don't have a paper though.
Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.) You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?
I gave a look?
It's not like you're my wife.
Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here.
Well the-the crowd must have gone wild!
I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting.
Why?
China really?
Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah?
Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.
Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.
So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?
No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.
Tell me what?
Oh.
But it's a big complex.
So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.
no I gotta go downtown
Me too.
(quietly crept out) This is really weird..
There's no precedent, baby!
Oh (laughing) Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting.
When did you get tickets to see that?
In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?
So forget about the books. Did you read them?
Alright.
Nah, look at this. Cable's out.
Oh, about the... uh (Jerry pretend to wash his hands)
Hi, um. Marla, Elaine.
I cant believe youre here.
I'll call an ambulance. (Exits)
People are going to steal from you. You cant stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker, whos gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They cant get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.
The pick?
Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.
Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper of the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack . . .
Look, I'm sorry-
The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?
Where's Celia?
Kramer, he's just a dentist.
(Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?
Really?
Well why are you going?
Yes, I know, I know.
Well..
I forgot to take it off.
Played cards last night.
I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.
You're right he's insane.
Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!
Oh my God, the blood!
Why don't you start in the bedroom?
Bye.
Course you know there is always the possibility, that she called an audible.
So call now.
"The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour". I'm confused.
Maybe it's not on this level.
I did not bail out on you.
(Pointing) You're on.
Elaine, would you marry me?
Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip.
What is it?
That is one angry clown!
It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.
You found the place.
That's what I was thinking.
Yes. Melrose Place.
Boy, that is some kick.
Cheapness is not a sense.
I'm coming down.
Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!
Sammy Davis had it.
There's girls everywhere. I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator. They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?
Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Yea nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?
I think he's gonna need, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
Ive got a ballpark.
I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine...
Oh, is this a bit?
What is the difference?
Aww, right. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it!
I think what he's trying to say is, "get the bouilla-base." (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)
Sorry.
Yes. (kisses Nana) Yes of course.
I know. They're not even related.
Hey.
(handing it over) Here.
Please.
(cynical) I'm sure it won't.
Don't be alarmed.
How you gonna do that?
Yeah, and youre just what shes looking for too  a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.
Hi.
So, uh, how are things with Jerry?
hmm. (nodding head)
She's pretty rough!
Lannie, how was the trip?
Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that "Miss Congeniality" on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going? (Kramer enters.) Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey, what are you doing tonight?
You won't even taste it?
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!
What? Yo-yo Ma?
He really did an amazing job. Look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid! (Jerry opens refrigerator.) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups! Come here, look at this. (He gets on his knees and points.) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there?! He must be like Rubber Man!
Where's the Mohel?
Music?
Well, there's nothing left. There's no food.
Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.
You know, if your future was a little more certain..
You didnt call no interference!
Would you?
No, you didn't.
That's nice.
You want something to drink?
How much are they payin' you?
Hello?
What the hell is all this?
A phony? He called me a phony?
I thought you might.
Fine all done, just looking for the soap.
Forget the sports jacket.
I thought you didn't want the doormat.
My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? (to the intercom)
Kramer! (We hear Kramer's door slam open and shut. Kramer enters. Jerry comes out of his room.) Hey! Where's all my sneakers?
Yum yum little tuna fishy?
So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?
Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.)
Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those orange cones you have on the throughway... (Sees pilot) on the way... up here... um... I..
Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money.
Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.
No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!
What is this? What are we doing? What in god's name are we doing?
I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.
So, when do I get my dinner?
I don't know, up state, Falls, somethin'
Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?
Don't ask.
Why does he do that?
Yeah, that's what I said!
Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.
What do you mean?
Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember.
Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. >click click<
Her tip.
(to Bania) Excuse me. (he goes back in the dressing room)
We'll be funny.
Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the sirens song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?
All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.
Yeah, it's in the kitchen drawer.
I dont care. Im sleeping next door.
Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.
All the time?!
Hello?
That's him.
I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.
So, coffee shop?
What if you destroy him?
I like the button fly.
(deadpan) That must be some book.
I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.
What? Nothing.
Oh. Hello, Tetanus.
What?
Yeah!
Yeah, tomorrow.
Hey, Isn't that my mother's fur coat?
Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen?
Oh, good, men love that!
Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?
Oh, here she comes.
He offered it to me.
Are you just screwing with me?
Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?
So they just gave you this?
Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.
I, I'm sorry.
Okay, starting...NOW!
No...
The one Puddy screamed at in the car?
Your friend, Noreen.
Again
I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and Ill just make up some excuse why I cant go to the game either.
Y'hello.
What do you care? You don't believe in hell.
O.K., soon as Elaine gets here.
All right lets go.
We could talk.
Uh.. one of the three tenors.
I did. Im just curious. Its been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points? (to Vanessa) Its up six points!
So you don't cry when your grandmother dies? But a hotdog makes you lose control?
Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car so I don't toss it in that dumpster?
Oh, that guy was your cousin! (walking in front of George so he gets the picture to leave)
(overhearing the other two) Oh, no.
Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.
Oh.
Theres more. The refrigerator.
You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.
Hey! Same initials . How do you like that?
Hello Poppie.
There should be more people like us.
Maybe I'll check out France.
Unless you're married.
What?
Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isnt that child abuse?
You know what it was, bad location.
Yeah.
No.
I'm Nelson!
Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back
I didnt know. Kramer told me about the worlds.
Mother of God.
What made you resurrect that old idea?
Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble...
..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye. HA Ha..Who do these women think they're dealing with? Did she think she was gonna leave this incredibly erotic message on my tape and I was just gonna let it go. Not Bloody likely...
Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's uh yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it?
You don't seem too bothered by it.
I think Chemical Bank.
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why dont you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin anything?
Whats with the pink lining and the candy stripes?
Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.
So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...
Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.
and GEORGE Ye, hu, um Ye,
I didnt know what the coma etiquette was.
Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?
Seth, it's me. What's more important than catching up with an old college buddy?
What, are you on Mercury?
What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha ha!
It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook?
(musing) What if it's Neil Armstrong?
But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?
Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here.
Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way.
Ma, will you stop?
Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? (hands Elaine the tape recorder.)
No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.
But theyre talking about nothing.
Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.
He's looking on to fridgerator.
You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.
Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.
All right, forget it, forget it. Im not taking the place!
(answering phone) Hello?
I didn't notice the voice.
Oh, really?
But the whole car smells.
Fire station?
Who was in town on a business venture, and um..
Oh, come on. Thats not true.
Where'd I take it?
You talked to him?
What he gave it to me.
240 bucks?
This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!
Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there.
I know.. How about dessert?
Ah, no , I don't think so.
I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy could write checks to himself right out of my account.
Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.
The baldies
What's all this about?
What're you doing here?
(Confirming) An alliance. (They both shake hands and laugh evily) Now get the hell outta here. (Newman leaves)
Mammal.
Yeah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.
Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.
Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!
No. No lunch.
Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.
Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.
Youre flesh and blood.
Tell her what?
Who am I?
Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.
Youre kicking me out of my house?
You left the keys in the car?
Elaine, have you ever flown first class?
So how come you're not going over there for dinner?
We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.
No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?
Are you going to say anything?
Big surprise.
He cleared his throat?
Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.
Alright, want to start?
You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.
I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special treatment.
No tippy toe.
Too domestic.
Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.
That's the point.
So, what did you do?
(Still skeptical) No, he doesn't.
No!!! The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him, you break his spirit!
You're going to rub out the dog?
I'm not wearing the fur.
Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?
I said pull over by the stop sign.
I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.
Is this yours or the roommate's?
Yeah.
Hey! How you doin'?
George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?
Oh hi Alex.
Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'?
Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs phone up)
He wants to talk about "Jerry"!
You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.
You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples clothes
You know
That has nothing to do with it.
Oh really? Elaine Marie Benes...
Out of town?
Oh my god!!
Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat...
I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home.
Come on let's eat something. (phone rings)
How am I gonna do that?
Why?
Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?
No.
So you started drinking.
Alright, alright. Uh, undo them. I'll help you get them off.
No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.
Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange?
(whatever) Fine..
Uh, Keith uh Hernandez.
(bossy) What are you doing?
Yeah, that's possible.
(on the phone) Hello? No, Im sorry Bania ... Im not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye.
Well, it couldnt be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?
Yeah.
Really.
I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.
Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for?
Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...
Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.
Excuse me?
Dermatology?
Trouble down at the plant?
Sniffing, with his nose.
I don't know
Hey.
I didnt bring anything.
How so?
The dog?
Used?
(To Elaine) Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get some coffee.
Oh, I didn't get the insurance.
I dont care about it.
So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.
All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.
Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?
Who the hell is that?
I have to go over to my grandmother's.
Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too.
Yeah.
That'd be the fleas.
No, I can't feel anything.
Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?
Yes!
He left me there. You see the mind games?
Uh, no, he's taking the car.
Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?
Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno.
I don't think that's it.
They're next to the poker chips.
Some of us.
Ill drive you to the airport.
Come on. Lets go
Too bad.
No, you stay here in the car. I may need you.
I did not!
Oh, that'll intrigue him.
Shaft.
No. I'm fine, thank you.
Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.
Oh. yeah. Alright. (pushes Kramer and Elaine out the door, then sits next to Sidra on the couch.) So, where were we?
The religious guy?
Sue Ellen Mishke?
What about the soup?
Like you didn't call me a phony?
Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, "Hey, they like the soup! Keep it up!"?
Oh, she had an itch.
Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,
What should I do, should I call the police?
Ah, I didn't have enough money.
You're Filk.
(still in tuxedo, tie undone) Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.
I told her about the contest.
Yeah, I looked. I saw.
You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.
George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.
Projectionists.
Really! Socks!
Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...
Hey, that's great.
(after the guy) You think you're better than me?
Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you?
Yes it will, now give me those keys!
well aside from that from that, how did he like the sandwiches?
The female orgasm is kinda like the bat cave, very few people know where it is and if you're lucky enough to see it you probably don't know how you got there and you can't find your way back after you left. There are two types of female orgasms, the real and the fake. And uh I'll tell you right now, as a man, we don't know. We do not know, because to a man sex is like a car accident and determining the female orgasm is like being asked 'What did you see after the car went out of control?'. 'Uh I heard a lot of screeching sounds, uh I remember I was facing the wrong way at one point. And in the end my body was thrown clear.'
"I don't know how you can eat that spicy chicken,"
Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
I know. Pretty steep.
All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape.
Sorry. Hang on.
Anyway, I don't need your help. (Turns to leave.)
(more disgusted) Ohhhh! You cant! Its impossible! Theres no break in the conversation where you can go, All right then... You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.
Yeah?
Well we went out one time. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
Okay, half-hour.
That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother.
I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
Really? Why?
No, did you?
[to taxi driver] Take the Park!
(defensive) He egged me on.
Well, thats it. You two are back together.
Hey Elaine, it's me.
It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
(to speaker) Coming down.
Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?
Okay.
Ah, it's just money.
I wonder.
You just met the guy yesterday.
Dad, it's got lots of other functions.
I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!
Myanmar.
Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he?
Whatever you want.
What's going on? You're the man of the hour, That's what's going on.
You're good with the mothers.
No, let's just do it. (Fire alarm goes off) What? What is going on? What is that about?
Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry pushes his door against Kramer's entrance]
(Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.
Being really clean and happy?
Pretty much.
What friends?
Done.
How about when Harrison Ford jumped out of that plane, and he was shooting back at them as he was falling?
...that's why men hunt and women nest.
I was got to be 55.
Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.
Oh, no way it's that big.
I don't have any change. You've got any change?
Hey, it happens.
He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.
Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.
"Lose that"? That's not a Hollywood expression!
Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. >click click click<...
Please-
I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy.
Thirty-six. What's the signal? Howbout this? Chicken wing? No, no, no, I got a better one. Head patting.
George, what's the matter with you?
Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?
Hi.
You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...
Fifty dollars?
..Alright.
They stole my car.
Stairmaster?
(Nodding) Yeah, the other guy.
You? How do you know?
how's you get her to meet here?
I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?
Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?
Take care.
Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.
Oh, that's classy.
What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you.
First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.
Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!
What's happening?
Name it.
You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.
They just took Susan to the Hospital
Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?
What, do you think I care about the money? Is that what you think? You want me to show you what I care about money? Here look, here look at this, here's a dollar here look, there, that?s how much I care about money.
So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.
Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?
Yeah.
What?
Yeah
Why?
[in French accent] Pardon.
Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the lunch with me?
Because he's my butler!
Yeah!.. Thanks.Oh! my god you saved my life.
Really?
Why don't we just rent a movie?
Oh.
Listen, Joel, I dont think we should see each other anymore.
You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!
You know Jeffery?
Its very good.
That's nice of you to say.
(Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.
Well, why can't you say it?
(thinking) Uh-oh... What do we have here?
"Did you notice he always refer to himself in the third person. Jimmy can dunk. Jimmy's new in town. Jimmy we'll see you later."
Oh don't threaten me, Butcher Boy.
It's Kramer isn't it? I knew it!  The greasy door knob the constant licking of the fingers, he's hooked to the chicken isn't he?
What? George Costanza, Frankie Merman.
I sense something is afoot.
Yeah.
How did you get this in here?
She's coming up.
Well, thank you very much.
Yeah. Like a farm boy.
What's even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics.
who do you think she is? how dare she? you want me to get the manager? too bad they don't have those old ladies walking around with flashlights anymore we'd flush her out
Look at you, you got the job.
"What the hell his a velvet fog."
It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!
What is that, anyway?
I just want a, touch em a little.
Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though.
You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?
So she didnt get the messages.
If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.
Hey. Look at you. Wha... what's this?
Yeah?
Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.
Could you make a little more noise? (To his parents) Listen, I'm gonna have to call you later.
Why didn't you just ask her for it?
Alright, take 'em.
I don't know.
(ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.
I know.
(standing) Alright, I'll see you later.
Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it.
Yeah, I blamed it on you. Hi Tim.
But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
Leroy
Well, looks are so subjective.
No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?
Breakfast?
What did you do?
So I dont know what shes using it for.
(with a wild expression) Hey, Kramer! I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open!
Hello. Anybody?
Ooh-ooh
(Pleading) Leo..
Trust me, you're off.
The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what youre doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? We have soda, we have soda, we have soda, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. Its a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and youre watching TV and youre drinking the exact same product that theyre advertising right there on TV, and its like, you know, theyre spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and Im standing there, Maybe Im putting too much ice in mine.
No I haven't?
Tropic of Cancer.
Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?
Yeah, maybe we have.
I don't know.
Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.
I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. (Picks up the phone and dials.)
Oh God, it's Joe Devola.
Isn't he, Elaine?
Okay, great.
Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!
Mine!
Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?
Aaaaahhh...!!!
No, no, I mean...
A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions) Ho, ho, ho.
If he does.
(looking at the TV) Look at the picture on this thing...
I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...
It's not totally impossible.
I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
That's because she had my mail.
You think they have fleas there, don't you?
It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.
(looking at Kramer) This is nice.
Well, well, well...
I think that's a "what's good for the goose is good for the gander".
(Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.
Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something.
Your trench coat in my closet?
No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.
I'm off the project. (He exits)
Hey!
So I said to him, "Whatever's necessary."
I think that's for the best.
I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I? (throws coat over his right shoulder)
What's the matter?
You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.
Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.
Cat fight with Raquel Welch.
I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.
Who are you, Mannix?
No. nothing.
Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket.
Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. (opens the fridge and gets a bottle of water.)
C'mon up.
A present.
Hmm.
Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed like ten new minutes.
When is this suppose to be?
So take it.
You tip him?
Dylan Murphy.
Did I just see that?!
This is gonna to be ugly. (quietly)
So what are you doing now?
Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. (Holds lettuce head) Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts the intellect, represented here (Pulls off tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large piece) Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats tiny piece of lettuce)
Huh?
(to Kramer) who is it?
Typical things.
So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.
You don't have a car.
I told you.
What the hell are you doing there?
Newman . Open the door, Newman, I know you're in there.
Marla, Kramer.
Hm.
Bob. Oh, Bob.
Well, its a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno...
I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.
Oh no you're not!
I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to Jack)
Get off of me.
I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.
Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.
Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.
Always helpful.
Yeah.
Look, what do you want me to do?
He doesn't even care if a man answers.
So *wash* *it*.
Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs.
23 000.
Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.
so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?
Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you.
It's against the law.
No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial.
(to George) Is that uh, other apartment still available?
What happened to you?
My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didnt want to move to Florida, but theyre in their sixties, and thats the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old peoples house with a golf cart, jump out, Lets go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. Drop it! I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversations so boring. Its so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, What if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass. You know. Come back in, theres broken glass, everybodys all upset. No, Im all right. I was just a little bored there. And uh no, Im fine. I came back. I wanted to hear a little more about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Lets pick it up right there.
I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.
He bothers me. I dont even answer the phone anymore because of him. Hes turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.
(removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?
I thought it was open to the public.
Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?
It's not like that at all.
I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?
I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.
No.
Did you shower today?
Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?
Like who?
Not good.
I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?
(Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together?
Are you sure?
(moving over to block the door) Where are you going?
Anyway, you know why I didnt ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab.
Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.
What?
It's not that hard.
Where did you get this?
Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.
Well, you want to sit with George? I think he's coming with Robin.
I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..
Oh... No, that's ridiculous.
No no come on really, get another one. Itll take a second.
How'd you get yours?
Corvelay?
Can't do it Newman.
Oh yeah? What'd he have to say?
Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.
Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?
Look, my friend saw you.
Got it. (but now a man-hand grabs his arm) Uh!
Yeah, that's right.
He let you?
Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.
I thought you saw that already...
Thanks, it's a breakaway.
Ehh, nobody listens.
Hey George, do you believe this guy?
How good?
Really? Did you talk to him?
So youre staying at Play Now?
I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?
Yeah, but--
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la. (haha)
(to George) All right, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend Im disappointed. Youre going to really see me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this. Maybe you should go in the other room.
Oh, like you know what you're talking about!
So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!
No, there's less.
Yello.
"Yeah!"
Last week on Seinfeld.
Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.
Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?
Two Forty-Five.
Boy, some cast, huh? Pavarotti, Aver Martone.
I don't know...
We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.
We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men.
What's going on out there?
C'mon, that's not fair!
hey Kramer do me a favour .
Ooow, that was close.
Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher.
No, you idiot.
She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.
You'll sense it.
(incredulous) You asked her to move in with you?
That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.
Hello.
Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle...
Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.
Did you get that at Joe's?
What are you talking about?
I don't have a washcloth.
Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.
Hey Todd.
Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.
It was a bisque.
All I said was "I like the pen".
What? I dunno.
No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.
Kramer's cooking up some corduroy.
Hu, well, tomorrow, I, ...
(Wakes up) Where are we?
What do you mean that's it?
No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.
Well, we got three bags.
It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look (searches for word) stupid. (to salesman) I'm sorry.
No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.
Hey. George off to Detroit?
I thought you were gonna watch a video.
Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?
Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.
(reluctant) Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy.
(pause) All night?!
*We*? No.
I am not an anti-dentite!
And shopping.
I should have some reason.
So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did?
I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.
No, of course not, of course not!
Yeah.
Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a One-woman show?
Come on, let's go Jean-Paul!
Im Jerry, Elaines friend, and this is George.
Well you're not even a fan. I was at game six - you didn't even watch it.
No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.
Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?
To the Laundromat.
And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.
Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum.
Looters.
It was an accident.
Listen, George, little problem with the game.
If he's black.
(quietly) I told you to cut it out.
No! There's no T-bone!
Hi, Louise.
Oh, no...
I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.
Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it They're roommates. She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back. She's not gonna do that.
Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket.
Im not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. Ive decided Ill do the work. Im gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? Cause you send your money out there  working for you  a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me. Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.
Elaine, you cannot judge a person on a situation like that. I mean it's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert
Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,
So what.
Gee thanks! Thanks a lot!
"Jimmy's got a record. Jimmy's jumping for dollars. Jimmt and George are gonna get rich."
You know, a TV show.
Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought.
Fasten your seat belts. we're goin' to see the baby.
So, Puddy, I decided Im gonna go with another 900 convertible.
No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.
You dont care?
Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. (They both walk to the booth and sit down. Suddenly, Gwen is attractive) Now this is a good looking booth.
I know. Im really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.
There you go. That'll get you home in time.
Good luck.
That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.
Anything else?
This is George, this is Kramer.
Well what does this mean?
(on the phone) Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.
So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian...
I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out.
So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.
(a little confused) You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables?
George- What?! Youre kidding... Well, whats wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, Ill speak to you later. (He hangs up.) Wilkinson, the guy whos supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, hes in the hospital.
Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby.
Is this a repeat?
Y-You didnt do anything. Its not you, its me. Its- this is very difficult.
why don't you just break it off with her. tell her it's over
Would you care to join us?
No, look, you don't understand. I, I want the picture.
Wa, it's two weeks old.
Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.
No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls.
Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.
If only the coin hadnt hit the table.
No, no, no, no.
Why don't you just get rid of it?
Wait a second. .Just give me a second
How would you know? You don't speak Korean.
She's Gooone.
It's nice to get a reach.
Were friends.
John Houseman?
No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.
Another shot, I want another shot.
That's a massage.
Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home?
All right, just give me a western. (unhappy)
Youre welcome.
Where have you been? You know, you're on next.
(finding Frankie, in his hole) Frankie... come on out of there.
Your butler?
Itll take two seconds.
Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?
Seriously?
(motions of making out) Well you were involved in some sort of amorous...
But then anyone can just look in and see you.
Nice meeting you.
Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car!
Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your guy?
The blond with the blue sweatpants!
He was down at the other end. So he yells out, "Ready, On your mark, Get set, " and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.
Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody.
No.
Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me?
Oh, no thanks. (turns back to Kramer)
Oh, hi Ellen.
This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.
Hey, do you know what the Whip does?
But not here. (They leave.)
So I guess , you're not getting married?
No, we're having an intervention
Well, that's it! Tonight's the night. I'm getting one. No "if and's or but's".
No I haven't seen it yet.
I love these nature shows, Ill watch and kind of nature show, and its amazing how you can always relate, to whatever theyre talking about. You know like youre watching the African Dung Beetle and youre going Boy, his life is a lot like mine. And you always root for whichever animal is the star of the show that week -- like if its the antelope, and theres a lion chasing the antelope you go, Run antelope Run! Use your Speed, Get away! But the next week its the lion, and then you go Get the antelope, eat him, bite his head! -- Trap him, dont let him use his speed!
(Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.
Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.
Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.
(to George) She thinks it's someone named Raef.
Kramer, who'd you sell your ticket to?
All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.
No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.
Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet?
Any messages?
The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?
Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
Sue Ellen Mishke?
You didn't go?
Morning?
Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off.
(Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.
What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying...
But I thought things were going great.
He feels funny. You don't have to do this.
(to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
I don't think my attitude has changed.
Poor Beth.
Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.
You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?
Maybe I'll let you pick me up.
(Picks one up) Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?
Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?
Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?
(glances at it) Pretty good.
So, what's it about?
Ohh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands. So.. (Goes for his coat)
Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?
(CONT'D) You want me to help you with that?
All right.
We're talking.
I don't know what to do.
I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?
If they like each other.
So you just pretended it didnt bother you?
Yesterday. Six-ish.
Of course I was getting you a note.
Did you bump into anybody you knew?
You know its not like changing toothpaste.
What are you gonna do about the roommate?
(pleading) I got a date. C'mon, please.
What, theres something wrong with Loni Anderson? (pause) Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it.
Nonsense. You do everything wrong.
You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!
I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
Have you thought any more about that trip?
So you don't think it's attractive?
So what?
What?
Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?
No, I'm okay.
Oh, boy.
Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
Hmm.
Oh, come on.
Oh hi.
Sorry. I don't have any tupperware.
I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.
Hello, Newman!
So, what's good tonight?
A bubble?
Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.)
Damn, I was too overanxious, he must have noticed that.
No, I asked him.
Oh sure like Monet.
Yours?....You know what I'll think I'll brush later.
Try to.
Come on up.
It's 530 in the morning!
No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 1030.
He does look like a horse.
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!
I just a ssumed, ...
Well, I'm a prospective member.
Why were dogs chasing you?
They still do that play?
You thought I was gonna get married?
Miffed.
Sure.
Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.
I cant think about it now. Come on, Im going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.
Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing.
There it is!...No, no that's a Toyota.
(dry) He knows.
O.K. (closes the apartment door)
Will you shut up George.
(Nodding) I think you may have something there.
Because its complicated. Theres some tension there.
Hey, Tim.
I don't know. Why?
George I'm telling ya..
Hey! Whattaya know!
Well, I brought them up there to take his records--
Bagels?
What do you want?
Yeah?
Really?
No, thank you.
You look like a pirate.
What?
Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.
You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.
Yeah, we'll do it another time.
He asked you to watch them not wear them.
Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers?
I forgot my toothbrush.
Yeah, Friday's okay.
(places two slices of bread against Kramer's face) That is close.
"I don't think I'm hungry"
"The Collected Works Of Bette Midler".
That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.
(Shaking his head no) Pff.
She is?
Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?
A Long Talker.
Don't you ever talk about her like that!
Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.
This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
Yes!
Ideally.
Well, how come?
If I see her, what do I say that Im doing here in the building?
What? Don't say that!
Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, they'll believe us.
David Putty used *my* move?
Hey, what is going on over there?
Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.
No break?
Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.
I've been waiting a while for this. You know it's a shame Tony got all banged up, we're not gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.
What?
Hey what about Dr. Resnick My Uncle Leo is going to see him tomorrow .
That's a five.
Here.
Yeah.
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.
Kramer, are you drinking that milk?
No.
I can't take it.
George was right. Didn't take you long.
You're not allowed to have people over?
I'm asking!
No. You?
A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?
Who is it?
That light!
Oh?
You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
Ill have the, ah, turkey club without the bacon.
No.
Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?
Is that my paper?
Great day in the morning.
I'll call back, thank you. (hangs up the phone) He went to South America!
Oh a slinky.
Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?
Holly Go-Lightly.
How do you like that?
(to waitress) I' ll just have a cup of coffee.
I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.
No.
Not yet.
No question about it.
Okay!
These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you?
Uh, well. It, uh...
Do I know you?
What happened to you?
You gotta wake him up!
Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.
Well, thanks anyway.
Youre wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!
Where are you goin'? Help me look!
You're turning.
How do you do? (introducing himself) Uh, Jerry Seinfeld.
I paid what it costs.
Could be it.
(standing) How much d'you want for it?
I don't know.
Im going out. (he comes out of the dressing room, while Kramer remains inside)
I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.
You said that?
Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!
Why?
I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I dont get this. Arent cows outside most of the time? I dont understand it. When its raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, Let us in, were all wearin leather. Open the door! Were gonna ruin the whole outfit here! Is it suede? I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I cant have this cleaned. Its all I got!
What happened, did you pass the stone?
Sure.
I don't think I can be that nice.
What?
So you bought a cooler?
What?
Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time.
Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.
The manager.
I just said that.
That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.
To my beautiful wife.
You want a gyro?
What blah?
Um. I'll call you back ok?
Heyy! Terrific.
None.
(to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?
That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus?
Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years.
Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley.
In your way.
Really?
And?
To the Paul Simon concert in the park!
I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. (Miss Rhode Island laughs.)
Good.
So you had a good time.
Absolutely not. He sped up.
Yeah, we'll see ya.
I know.
You knocked him out.
There was another crazed ex-girlfriend?
What did you do the rest of the day?
Is there a box spring?
Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.
Uh, yeah, I think I do.
George?
So what would you do? You'd hitch?
(quietly) Hey, uh, Milos, I don't mind rolling over here, but could you lighten up on the 'not a man' stuff?
(to the Drake) Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye...
(turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isn't that your charter group?
Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.
Well what about me?
So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! (haha)
I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.
(rueful acceptance) Oh, yeah, I understand.
I'll see you tonight. (he's opening his door apartment as Kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe)
What's with you?
Hi
Yeah, see you.
Nothing.
Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you (throws the bottle to Kramer.)
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.
You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!
I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.
Hey, what's happenin.'
(about the cable guy) Nice people.
Yep..
Sorry about that.
There's nothing subtle about that.
No.
Eventually a little shot of penicillin
No more crutches, that must be a relief.
(eating pop corn) hmm I love this artificial flavoring I like it better than butter I think it's more consistent
Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh, Ketchup? Pretty name for a girl.
(muffled) Would you like something to drink?
Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)
A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?
Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.
I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
So it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato.
Then you're in a lot of trouble.
I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I dont know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because its really not a definite thing yet. (crowd cheers him on to tell them) Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that Ive received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. (audience applauds) Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didnt even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, thats what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, You may have already won. Id like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, You have definitely lost! You turn it over, giant printing, Not even close! You open it up, theres this whole letter of explanation, Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest.
I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there.
No you can't. (hangs up the phone) Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?
(back in booth) He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life.
All right, bye. (to Elaine) You see this? Any thought pops into their head they're calling me because it's a local call now.
You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us.
Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
My neighbour
I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.
(Pleading) Leave me alone.
Did she say why?
I'll remember that.
Here.
No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.
Is that like the end of the world or something?
What move?
Sure.
Medium crab bisque.
You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.
Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?
What?
Assman?
Sure.
Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just -
you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?
Okay.
Wow! Hey, theres Clare. I better go down.
No, believe me it's not good. I'll mail you a new one with something really funny written on it.
And nothing could change your mind?
See ya.
You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.
Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me?
A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?
Oh, come on!
Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?
No. What happened to you?
Didn't they just have a baby?
C'mon, c'mon.
I'm serious!
Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank.
Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend.
what's all set?
You ready?
My stomach, I , think it was that cookie.
Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.
..And then she starts talking about her panties.
I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect.
(putting the phone back to his ear) Yeah.
Yeah, over here.
I said, never mind.
When did you build this thing?
(reading on) "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-"
I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.
Whad you think Susan?
Very good looking.
No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'
Yeah, let's just get out of here.
Uh, you don't have to take a picture.
I told you we shouldn't do it.
The waiter was trembling!
Ok.
Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!
No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.
I mean, if were gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.
All right, all right.
Actually, it was a ********.
But, when did I do that?
Ah, I should have got the egg white omelet.
I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.
It's here!
Hey.
I heard those doves were really incredible.
You're beautiful.
Hey, I want my van keys back.
to basically give this money away-
That old scam.
yeah, so?
Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.
You don't have a Mercedes.
Hi, Alec.
No, for both!
Thanks.
(acting like he was walking on stage) Hey how ya doing? Good to be here.
Yes I am skeptical.
But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship.
(under his breath) Oh no.
(Not believeing it) Prior convictions? Leo?
Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it.
The Truth.
It should resolve of its own volition.
What is that?
Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?
and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye.
Hey. The butler's here.
So he just gets soup. He wants to save the meal. So now I got to do it all over again.
Oh, then I gotta tip him.
I really don't feel like seeing her.
No, George was there, he said he had a great time.
All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier. (Elaine drinks straight out of the orange juice container) Hey.
I know it.
So are you gonna get him a chair?
I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.
Hiya, Jack.
Unbuttoned, or all the way off?
Yes, we have.
(noticing a coffee table book) Oh, you got the Civil War book. I saw some of that show, it was wonderful.
Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will.
Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation.
What is it your business?
Wait. How does Horneck know you?
A bowl, ok?
Are you sure?
Yes, but--
Uncle Leo.
But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.
Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what are you doing?
Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys.
Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!
Oh Come on!!
Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?
I can see that. What's it for?
You don't like her?
I'm flying down to Florida tomorrow.
If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. Hes always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess its because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.
She did, you insisted.
What strike?
Come on. How was your date?
No tune.
You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.
What was that?
(Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.
well maybe she couldn't spare it
(C0NT'D) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.
Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.
Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe well get together.
Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.
No, he was on his regular bed.
What clothes?
Ya, what's there to talk about.
Um hum.
Come on, I'll go with you.
What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.
Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.
I dunno, it was an impulse.
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!
Talk to me.
I'm nauseous.
(To cashier) I'd like to speak with the manager, please.
(looking of into the distance) I guess that's true...
Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.
All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a specimen.
Well, technically he did apologize.
Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.
Oh, like you do.
I mean, let's say we did.
75,000 lira.
It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?
Happy camper , I don't hear that expression enough.
Excuse me?
Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!
Really? What would you like to do?
So he's been lying to me for two months?!
We could visit together!
What are you doing here?
No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.
What did she say?
So theyre not paying you your
Oh yeah? Huh.
I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.
Would. Does. Is.
That's the garbage disposal!
You're breaking up?
Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!
Of course, I stink, you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks..
Hi, happy birthday.
Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time.
How can I ever have you over? Youll sit there moping.
Uh, I don't know, we used to go out.
Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.
Here. I got your money.
You know, furniture.
Kramer, Kramer, what is this?!
I'm swamped.
Yes, I'm impugning a continent.
Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. "Oo that little tail really turns me on."
Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.
Doesnt think anyone can tell. So cmon, do we have a deal?
Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.
No, I mean, I don't think so.
He couldn't.
It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.
Im just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.
I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how theyre going to look at a thing like this.
(Explaining) George has become a hand model.
No, it's tarragon. Hey Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had about you having my apartment keys and everything.
(Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do?
(Losing it, mad) Look, it's not my shirt.
Hello..
You didn't mind?
(watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans?
No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.
But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.
Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!
So then as I was getting out of the car, ...
(answering the ringing phone) Hello?
I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I dont get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, Im not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, theyre so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, thats it! Its the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we dont know bout that, we dont know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas weve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! I dont think she likes me. The amazing thing is, that we still get women, dont we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. Thats why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like Where to meet men? Were here, we are everywhere. Were honking our horns to serve you better.
All right Ramon, Im going to get going.
I don't know  he's got some valuable antiques, He's worried they'll break something.
"Hest"? That's not a name.
Well that's a start.
Oh, I'm sure it's fine.
So lemme ask you this how long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night.
Anywhere.
What? What?
Casus belli.
Too dumb?
So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk.
No.
I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?
Ohhhhh, that's great.
All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.
I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.
I was blowing on the coffee.
Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.
Hey, Bob.
Well, well, look at you. It?s a little skimpy there isn't it?
You?
You lost the 20.
Is the flounder here yet?
Mohair, I think.
That's strange...
Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.
Hi.
(Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to look, but Jerry stops her) I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs.
What kind of look?
Because she's my wife! (The door buzzer sounds; Jerry answers it) Yeh?
(privately amused) Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while. (indicating Elaine) Her too.
What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.
(mind's voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?
Are you sure?
Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George.
Who?
Kramer, look, it's George.
Of course I want to talk about it.
Yeah, I saw him.
I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.
You cant have that coat, it's not yours.
Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.
Two o clock.
I think it has something to do with me.
Hey! Did you get the Volvo?
Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!
Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?
So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?
The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.
Russell's disappeared?
Maybe he didn't know?
You what?
Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just wanted to pick it up.
What? The Cadillac I bought for you?
Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
Well what about the week after?
(taking out his wallet and handing over bills grudgingly) Fifty dollars.
I'm too tired.
Good, going good (scratches chin) And the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty good - not bad - I gotta get out. (scratches chin, nose then covers eyes with hands)
Toilet paper's changed.
Really?
Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else.
Sure.
Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.
I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.
Im meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.
On the other hand...
I dont return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.
Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.
(examining) Hey George, you know what? I think this crest is different. It's got a moose on it.
Never mind.
Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.
I think you're getting a ticket.
Absolutely not.
Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore...
Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.
What?
Hi.
You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it.
Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.
I don't know.
Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
Ah, I think I'll go.
Oooh! Bay-bee *doll*!
Hey. Elaine's quitting.
here.
..Yeah.
So, he's definitely married, huh?
Mr. Vandelay, of course.
What was that?
That's final!!!
Well do you feel anything?
Bad rap?
Nice Mohel picking, Elaine. You picked a helluva Mohel!
Hey, there's uncle Milty.
There's Sidra.
On what?!
(quietly) Mm-hm.
Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?
Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him.
His father..
Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)
He can't handle the truth!
I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin else.
Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.
What?
I'm gonna find out tonight.
Kramer. Yeah that'll do.
George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say,kookie talk.
Not goin' to the Knick game.
Not for me, I love chatting.
Come in.
Yeah, but how am I...
Maybe you should date the mothers.
You're getting married?
Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser.
What?
To be polite? You are insane!
Boy, am I glad to see you.
Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...
He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.
I get peeved.
After one date you try and improvise on her machine?
No I gave it back to you
Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?
That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
Is Tatiana coming?
I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
Yeah and?
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?
We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! Well be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life.
You?
I find the whole thing very embarrassing.
He invested in it.
So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, "Jerry"? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They're putting it on the air! They're giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California!
This could be an emergency!
Eckman? I thought he was doing time?
No, it isn't. I can find out.
No kidding?
(Fishing for his keys in a kitchen drawer) You know, when I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time.
I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. (Slams the door on Newman's face. Then tries to delay talking to Newman by keeping the conversation with George going) So, you want a protein shake, or something?
Yeah?
Tatiana...
What?
I don't think so.
Soo...
How's the gas situation?
Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless.
Toilet brush, oh (he pulls a 'Damn, shoulda guessed!' face). Alright, I can replace that.
With me?
Yknow, my parents are coming in for this...
Possibly.
(opens the door for George) Where did you get that?
Irish money?
(CONT'D) And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.
You're really going to town with that turkey there.
What colour is it?
Why don't you get a sandwich?
No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)
The poly?
Actually, I'm drunk.
The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.
I said, "How come no one's killed her?" Probably shouldn't have said anything,
Kramer.
Is that bothering you?
Patty Lawrence had 'em!
No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.
Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton.
Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain?
It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.
I know!
Well, he was wrong.
Oh, don't tell me. 'Cause he's black?
What's with you?
You're not undoing anything.
All right
What? He can't do that.
Hey. What are you doing?
Aloe. So where's that lock smith?
I have aloe!
Volcano? Really?
I don't know what to tell you, Elton.
Good question.
No I dont see it.
well
So, where do you want to eat tonight?
(continuing) No rejection, no guilt, no remorse.
His illness is your business.
We'll eat it in the movie.
Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...
She's not beautiful.
Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease?
She didn't touch it.
She's as good as anybody else.
Hello Milos.
Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.
Yes it is.
Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.
Maybe she'll sweeten.
Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
So what happened?
(pushing her) How did you get that?
So George and I went up to NBC and we told them the idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract.
A beard?
No, its not you. Its your stomach, hes taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.
"Kom Pau(sp?"
(Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-
Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.
Oh my God!
Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral?
A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?
Oh, no, no.
Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up.
(To Kramer) All right, were goin in.
I will, I just walked in the door.
Aye, aye.
Which flavor?
How long has she been there?
Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?
(no amused) Fantastic.
You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.
You mean that?
Why?
"Caught" you? Doing what?
(positive) Fantastic. Fantastic woman.
It's a simple question...
Wow, this is incredible!
NO.
How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable special . I 've never gotten a cable special.....well that's it I'm not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado. (to the silent Kramer on the couch beside him) ...Exactly.
(shocked) Wha, what are you talking about?
Hey Phil how you doing?
Okay.
They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
Cause Im an idiot! You may think youre an idiot, but with all due respect, Im a much bigger idiot than you are.
What?
But then we would have missed the whole thing.
You don't know?
Is she OK?
(proud to Peggy, under his breath) Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. (winks)
Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched voice) Gone.
I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating.
Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.
C'mon...c'mon...
to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?
So, what did she have to say?
Pretty nice.
Yeah.
No you didn't. He knows he's bald.
What happened to all the towels?
Sorry!
No kidding.
You need an exterminator?
No. I know what I want.
Yeah.,
Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail.
You don't like the Drake?
That's a hell of an organization they're running up there. I can't understand why they haven't won a pennant in 15 years.
I heard something.
(leaving the room) I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much.
Where's George?
Uh-huh. Yeah. So, anybody specific?
Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.
Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.
No, no I don't. Why?
What is that?
I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldnt do that.
So...
Hey, when Im driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. Im always waving everybody in. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. ...All right. All right. Ill have a chicken salad.
Yeah, that's your thing.
Never. (The elevator door opens.) Wait a second. Thats her. On the right.
I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
New couch, baby!
Who said that?
But, I never...
Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out...
That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.
Kramer, what did you do?
He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man that's some tart cider!
(offering a plate) Chicken?
They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!
Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.
He's nice, bit of a close talker.
Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!
Alright, shut up, here they come.
So, you and Lyle are roommates?
Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal, (steer).
No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?
I could, but I choose not to.
(looking after the guys) That nut is always up to something.
How 'bout if it was something like " I can't find my receipt my place's a stye.
No, separated.
You look like a tourist.
Get a march goin'! March it! (She exits)
I like that thing in your hair there.
(Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.
Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved.
I think we should separate here actually.
Well, what is he, a vampire?
Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.
Ooh, (to Elaine) case closed!
I gotta talk to her. What do you think?
all right lets be reasonable, Bania. Im taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal.
What?
Where ya goin'?
Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
(Getting up) Uncle Leo. Hello!
Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him)
(Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 'French Impressionist Paintings'?
I don't know, whatever they do.
Ok...
I told it. (Answers the buzzer) Ya?
Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!
Well, frankly it is.
Hey Sid.
Oh, wow.
What happened you didn't give her the papers?
Hello Newman.
Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it.
Any luck?
Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.
[Elaine]
Right in front of me!. How do you know we're not together. Two guys, sittin' laughin' drinking Champagne Coolies.
What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I would've done, if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!!
Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.
What did she name the kid?
No, she's not.
Do you like the Drake?
Thank you, no.
We have an appointment!
Manny...
Well, thats it. Look, Im going to Vermont. I dont want to think about this. Im selling.
My grandmother's in the hospital.
So you have no control over the remote?
So tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?
What? (to George) What did, what did you say?
On the couch.
So?
Ready for lunch?
(Peeved) I don't have any material!
Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?
Are you serious, what about Elaine?
Open my vault?
I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory.
Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place.
So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?
Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.
We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
Stealing? You loaned her the racquet!
Mmm.
What time is the lesbian wedding?
WE HAD A PACT!!!
No, come on!
What for?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
C'mon, put the top up, it's November!
No, no. Still doin the big sweep across.
What did you say?
Im takin it, Im takin the place. Im gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. Im livin here...Im movin.
You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?
You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?
I was terrible.
Intervention.
is beating the bushes-
You should have her work on it for you.
Well, I can't sleep with that noise.
Oh, it doesn't matter now.
(Trying to shut him up) Kramer.
I don't think the network will go for it.
Okay. I mean, what if the--
151?
... I think. Have some more wine. (Jerry pours his whole glass of wine into her glass.)
Does that thing work?
Ahh!!! They're out!
This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes) Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?
I'm just not getting any hot water.
I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.
What's wrong?
So they're like everyone else.
Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.
Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me.
A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision.
Maybe, maybe
So how long do they do this?
(uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.
'I'm not here, leave a message.'
Were you talking? I couldn't hear anything.
Are you sure?
I didn't hear anything.
Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
What's coming?
I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.
You could get arrested.
It doesn't matter. I want a divorce.
What'd ya get?
I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodations. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats.
Where are you going?
Sex... to save the friendship. (Elaine drops her bag, takes off her jacket and walks into Jerry's bedroom) Well, if we have to (un-tucks his shirt) we have to.
No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No.
Like a frightened turtle!
All right.
Everything?
Its not promised to anybody? Cause shed take it in a second.
Yeah.
SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya! (the inter- com buzzes) Yeah?
Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying "mickey"!
Thank you...
She's an eskimo, actually.
Why are you shouting?
Okay.
Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot.
Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.
'...downtown.'
Na, that's not such a good idea.
Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?
(worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!
I'm telling you, the guy took.....
(Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.
What did I just pay for?
What?
Hey, thanks a lot for lettin' me stay here.
You scared me!
That's room 419. 650 AM. Four...one...niner...
What, he doesn't like my taste in music?
Yes, it is!
This is horrible! I care!
What is goin' on in there?
So, does he like you?
Could you?
She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?
So where you gonna sleep?
Are my nostrils getting bigger?
(Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.
Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat.
Did you get your laundry?
Fine, if I'm off yours.
(Angered) Hello.. Newman.
Let me have a look at this thing.
What, you got a problem with the pen now?
Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'
Yeah. Good seeing you again Karen.
Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.
Ah, very good.
You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?
Oh uh, Kramer, this is Donna.
Tryptophan.* (*footnote - see end of script)
I don't know.
But...
Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here.
No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.
You sure?
Over here. You can see right through here.
I can't buy mangos and plantains?
George!
Well, we gotta get it washed (pulls off a few flyers)....Ah, the keys are locked inside!
Your hands were in the dough?
Well, at least have some reaction to it.
To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in, in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in "morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? fine" Ten minutes later you see him in the hall, "How ya doin'?" Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow "Hey" You start coming up with nicknames for them. "Jimbo."
(Trying to read the note) What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit.
Tongue?
That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen -
You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.
Elaine?!
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed...
You got the tap?
The fabric of society is very complex George.
Why dont they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, Just Back. All back; No front. You walk in the front, youre immediately in the back. (Jerry picks up a tie display, and shakes it rhythmically from left to right.) Look, Elaine, tie carwash.
Oh, right... But you *hated* it!
Uh-huh.
Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. It'll crush him.
Alright.
Yeah thats a good deal -- you win the Pennant with that trade, hair for phlegm.
I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.
(determined) I wanna join. I need it to become a member.
I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.
And what do I say about you?
A cop car.
Cant get it.
Elaine?
What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty minutes of 'So, who's from out of town?'
What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasnt the one.
Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?
Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.
Ah...the volume.
Okay.
What?
Thin ice, George. Thin ice..
First we ride the cyclone.
Youre engaged?
No thanks.
That's because you didn't win.
Yeah.
Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?
How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?
Kramer.
(not excited) Youre engaged?
What did you say?
What's going on here. How is that possible?
Really?
Sure. If there cheap Why not.
Give it to me!
Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?
uh uh because then it would be all grown up.
Nooo, I don't. (the elevator doors shut)
A deep, yawning chasm...
Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.
All right (picks up his sports bag)
What are you gonna do with it?
Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference who's tall. We're all tall.
Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere.
Its raining? Its raining. The game will be postponed. Well play tomorrow.
Hello? Yeah he's here. (to Kramer) Hey! It's for you.
I know, I just can't bring myself to do it meanwhile that freezer keeps getting smaller and smaller (she smiles) (Elaine looks at her watch) oh, don't wanna keep Tony waiting
All right, the whole elevator business, let me just explain-
I knew this would happen.
Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.
What did you say?
I thought you said it was imminent.
Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...
(to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...
Yes. Yes I am! (to Helen) What else did she say on the phone?
We'll take a check please.
So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?
(answering) Hello?
I was kidding when I said that!
No.
No, I hadn't noticed.
You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?
It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.
David!
So what? You're entitled.
Georgio! Nice duds!
We'll always have...pancakes.
Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?
I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.
Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerrys office. (Elaine is looking confused). Were going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean hes already left?
(a la "Don Corleone") Never go against the family, Elaine.
(Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?
You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
Did you see that?
I didn't know you had a hopper.
Look I really don't know what they're plans are.
Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction.
What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must be something. What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks?
(taps on the window) Hey...
It's 1030 in the morning?
Any Hennigans around here?
Mulva...
I'm sorry, uh,
(watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this?
It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.
(downcast) No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
Ah, dinner! Thats it, youre all the way back!
What is wrong?!
To the door?
Ouf.
I was arrested for urinating.
(to Elaine) Harold and Manny.
Is he on the plane now?
(realising) Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. It belongs to the Friars Club.
What?
Tuck in, tuck in.
I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'?
Ok.
Well what am I supposed to do now?
Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.
That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!
I hope so.
You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!
A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guys got a coma going like this  you dont want to mess with it.
(Still pulling) Squinch em!
A gun?!
She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. [sarcastically] I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... >click click< Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? >click click< I'm back...
Well that's what's important.
Let's go out and celebrate! (they all get up)
No.
I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.
So you say she was on a horse?
Right, just like you.
It's a cigar store Indian. (to Elaine) Read the card.
With the smelling.
Oh, hey Bania.
The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.
Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.
What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with. [To attendant] What is going on?
Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame.
(barring the way) I'm sorry. I-I don't know you.
(eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.
Why?
So...
First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did.
We were ten.
Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.
No story?
she's one of these people, always have to be different
It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.
Is that right?
Hey, Kramer, over here.
(to intercom) Yeah?
Really?
Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.
George, does your father speak Korean?
Sure. See, things always even out for me.
Kramer?
Yeah, come on, it's a good match.
Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger.
No, its, its just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it. (Jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) Ten-fifteen... No, dont be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, its no trouble at all... Ill see you tomorrow... Great, bye. (He hangs up the phone; to Kessler) I dont believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here!
You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... (he spots a mailman crouched emptying a box) Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.
Well it's not tragic.
...all right!
No. You?
Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.
You sure?
And youre sure the floss was the catalyst?
And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard-working Americans!
Mentor? You mean your boss.
No, no. Its not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, its not like Marlenes a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, weve had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling. (George nods.) And its these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if Im busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and shes in the middle of a sentence!
Are you okay? Did he bite ya?
Dead?
Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.
Yeah.
Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?
The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?
Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?
You what?
He's supposed to see ME on Friday.
(Trying to change the subject away from Nina) Hey - Hey Kramer, what are you doing? You want to borrow something? You want to eat something? Come on in!
Yes, bye.
(Joking about the bra-less wonder) Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.
Tony.
Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?
So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!
Hey, cable guy's looking for you.
Here we go.
I've always wanted to do that...
I wanna see what's happening.
So write a letter.. move to another...move to Staten Island., 'lot easier to blend in a sea of people in Staten Island than China believe me.
On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!
There was no mistaking it?
No...
Sure.
You know, what would be great?
You think so?
That's it?
Oh, it won't be for that long.
Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.
That doesn't work, we'll give 'em Kramer!
....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together.
You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.
Oh, I'm gonna puke.
In all of Tuscany? I wonder.
Um, I don't even know?
Cause you know, I love Elaine.
I can't wait.
Unlce Leo, what are you doing here?
Well, ...
Listen, Matthew, I-I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do.
"Hey, by the way, did you ever call that guy from the health club.?"
Okay...
(looking over the list) Hmm ah. I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?
Yeah, right.
Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?
Who?
Shes gotta be here soon.
Uh-huh...
We won't ruin the friendship.
It's green.
This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.
Yeah , she's coming to see my act tonight.
(on the phone) Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye. (hangs up the phone)
You're gonna fight?
Why?
Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--
Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money..
Well he doesn't even want himself there.
Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.
(pulling on a jacket) They had a cancellation and they instantly called me.
Elaine, see this T-shirt, six years I've had this T-shirt. It's my best one, I call him Golden Boy.
I love you, Costanza.
Its a list of excuses, its for that guy, Horneck, whos at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I dont have to see him. (Elaine laughs.) I need it. (Elaine starts writing on the list.) What are you doing?
So what are you going to do with the mattress?
I want to!
Hey.
Have you slept with him yet?
Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?
I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?
You've gotta smell the car
And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
That's enough.
Yeah?
So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.
Were just not suited to be friends.
You can't unclog it?
So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing?
(Relating) Like the Batman villain?
Ho ho!
It's just like in the movies.
Will you stop it.
I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I - I don't even remember the name of the town.
Why don't you rent the movie?
I hate the counter.
Son of dad?
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh!!!!!!
I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test?
Sophie.
I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them are doing her dance as they go)
Hey ya know I read an unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the other day, did you know the original title for "War and Peace" was "War--What Is It Good For?"!
This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?
Hm. You ate.
Oh... yeah. What? I'm sorry.
Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! (Kramer gestures sympathetically) And who buries a bird?
Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?
Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.
We'll take 'em!
(through gritted teeth) Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.
No, Im gonna take my car.
Hes an importer/exporter.
What?
(pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?
Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.
See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.
First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.
(giving in) Alright.
Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--
Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?
So, Leo, how's everything? You doin' Okay?
See, its never as bad as you imagine.
(Shocked at his parents) You're stealing too?!
We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk.
I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it.
"What about the Velvet Fog ?"
(Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.
Geoffrey who?
(taps George's chest) Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six.'
Eh, it went okay.
Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?
All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've flown first class, Elaine-- I can't go back to coach. I can't... I won't...
Yeah.
Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?
George, george...
I can get it. (feeling his face)
I have an idea. (Elaine enters; to Elaine) We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three.
I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?
All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry.
Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.
Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.
Where did you meet this guy?
What?
All right.
Why no T-bone?
Hey, Tony.
You faked with me?
No appointments at all? (motions to Elaine to move over)
Pull yourself together. Your going in there soldier! That's an order!
She should just give up.
Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?
Well, you know. I mean... I dunno.
Like what?
What?
(shrugs) Hey George I think I want to bring a date to the wedding
So, you would date a married guy? That's so hacky.
No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.
Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars.
I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.
(getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.
It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!
What's the difference? You never showed up.
But you didn't really do any work.
What're you doing? I thought you were changing.
What academy?
Yeah, big missing goin' on (spreads arms wide)
(quickly moves over toward Matthew) What the *beep*(fuck) are you doing? You little piece of *beep*(shit)!
Alright, soldier boys, let's fall out.
Are you ready?
Forget it.
Elaine's writing a "Murphy Brown"?
Well, you picked out a rooster.
I really don't see the difference.
What?
He said they had a good time.
This is your plan?
Okay, take it easy. (hangs up) That was Keith. we're going to do something next week.
No, just Meryl.
Hmm. So Cynthia's your mentor.
SO?
Yeah, that's a deal. That's a terrible deal. I don't want to go out to dinner with him. Id rather make my own suit.
Yeah, so.
No, no this is more important.
(disbelief) So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?!
Gee, I never thought of that.
Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.
Wait a second, whats going on here?
(screams).
Hey, get out of here...hey officer, he's fooling around back here.
I, I love that George.
Yeah?
(Patting his head I'm a comedian.
Well it's gone. Im sorry. Good-bye Bania.
Who is it? Who is it?
Well, you know; not everything. I do what I can.
What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?
Oh, yes.
Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.
Yeah...
All right! Take it easy! Take it easy.
What?
See I was saying "six" but she thought I was saying "sex". We straightened the whole thing out though.
You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.
No one's gonna listen to you.
Go look at your face in the mirror.
Oh.
This is Amy.
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
(frowning in realization) Oh, no!
Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.
O.k., good, I'll see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.)
(Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) It'll be on your conscience.
Shh! Nothing, nothing.
Huh?
Im not looking.
It's a pig at a complain department.
I couldn't
(chewing) Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?
Ah, you're screwed.
Irked?
(pointing toward the guy) See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.
What's his problem?
Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?
Hello,  oh hi Elaine .. what's going on  no he just left  you broke up with him?  ME TOO .. what happened?  oh smoking you know you're like going out with C. Everet Coope  me  nah  I couldn't go through with it  I just didn't feel ready  so what are you doing now?  Oh, great idea, I'll meet you there in like thirty minutes. Okay bye.
You just can't leave him out there.
He was shouldering.
All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura opens the door and gets out). What? What?
So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?
85 cents? That is Outrageous!
I don't know.
I'm not talking about upside down. (Jean-Paul and Kramer come in) I'm talking about waking him up!
Yeah. are you full?
Yeah , yeah .
You joined the *Polar Bears*?!
Oh, no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down. (George & Jerry each slide to the end of their booth seats)
Another friend?
I know.
No, I tried it on. It fits good.
Oh you are beautiful!
I dunno, maybe...
Yeah.
(shouting) Kramer what am I going to do did you hear that that guy's gonna put a kibosh on me he's crazy he's out of his mind....
That was something.
What?
This stuff on top is my friends. Could I get it done in a separate machine?
... um ...
Oh yeah, you and your *Sergio Mendes*...
Ya take it easy.
Let me just wipe the sink.
NOW!!!!.... (she leaves in a hurry)
You know my friend Bob Sacamano?
I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?
No one's going to do that.
You know, Gary (slams shut the door) I had a little chat with George the other day...
Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.
If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.
We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy.
(Sees Elaine leaving) Hey! Wh-where are you?
How did you get in?
Yeah right.
--but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is inadvertently sent an insurance--
I don't know what that could be.
(Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What?
Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.
Little buffer zone.
My what?
I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
All right Nik. That's it.
Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other line. Just a second.
What happened?
Oh. (unh - very quiet sigh)
Listen, Joel. Theres something I have to tell you...
Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?
D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?
Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for show.
Oh, sorry
(to Elaine) I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog. (to George) Get this one "I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest".
(Only turning back for a second) Hey.
Really.
Cmon, cmon, go ahead, move up.
U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you?
That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this?
I can't do this.
All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.
I got a haircut.
(whispers) You can't just have water.
(protesting) I..I didn't say that.
(looking at the cop) What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think he's getting coffee.!
Brave new world, alright.
I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I cant imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but thats me. Alright
So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything?
(Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!
You want food, don't cha? (nodding his head up and down)
(opening the door) Well, it was nice meeting you.
Yeah.
Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read. I was wondering if-
Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.
...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana...
(smiling) Yeah
Where's Kramer?
Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.
So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?
You drew up plans for this?
All right. Put 'em on top.
Oh, Martin!
Yeah, well, I didnt- Is that something you want to borrow?
How much are they payin' you?
Yeah, that's right!
...C'mon.
So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.
Why can't you get it?
Which is with who?
What can I do?
Good personality. Funny. Bright.
I don't know.
Well, I'm sure you're not... Totally Depleted.
Yeah.
Are you sure?
The New Yorker?
Right in the head! (leans in and points at Testikov)
Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..
Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do.
Well, your day's getting more interesting already. (Jerry shows the phone) Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.
This... **thing**... has got to be stopped!
Who?
I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.
Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner?
Doctor? Hes a podiatrist.
They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing."
Dermatologist? Skin doesn't need a doctor!
I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
Almost. (Notices his shoes) Hey, new Timberlands?
What is going on?
No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I dont know her name.
Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh...
I am not gonna taste your peach. I ate some one's pecan last night, I'm not gonna eat your peach.
Uh, I don't have anymore pictures Elaine.
That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this, okay...
What, you got a cold?
I have fleas.
Oh boy...
So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club.
I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!
How would you describe the smell in this house?
Yeah, maybe you won't.
I don't know.
Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.
You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.
Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
Tony, hey hey (continues fooling)
He's not that good.
I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.
I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.
That was an accident!
Nexus of the universe. Hey, Cindy. Cindy.
What do you mean?
"I don't know but I was spitting out and rinsing like there was no tomorrow."
Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?
Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..
So you do live here.
They're busting this guy.
Ok, ok...
(backs his story) Hmm, hmm.
Yeah, too bad.
Swirl.
It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.
No, no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts.
Well... theres a little bit of a problem.
You mentioned the raisins.
Who's there?
Ah! boy.
(surprise) This is your son?
Oh, you dont recall?
Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.
Elaine, what do you think?
I'm open. There's just nothing in there.
So what?
What for?
(Confused) Where's the punchline?
What?
(Correcting her) Edmund Fitzgerald.
It was the single worst moment of my life.
When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion.
Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer, sitting on his lawn chair with a sparkler)
Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye.
Hello.
Who is it?
There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.
Don't go a-knockin'.
Oh, no.
Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! Its a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!
Huh?
I haven't been out yet.
You know, you're little hair hat there.
Yeah!!!
Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal [and, ala Carson] Wild, Wild, Stuff...
Ehh, I dunno..
Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?
Lets hear yours.
No, I'll be back.
No, really.. an airport run.
No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage?
How about we leave and, come back in a week?
Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours. (And with that, Jerry made the most fatal mistake of his life)
Sure.
I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
Come on up.
What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at work?!?
(Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.
Why don't you just come over?
Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.
5000.
I could tell you what I did, but you wouldnt believe it. Its not believable.
Yes.
No I haven't.
(reading) Jewish singles night?
Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! (runs back to his seat) Bad lighting on the porch.
I know enough not to get on them.
You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didnt take it. (pointing to himself) This is an idiot.
A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?
What is this?
No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it. (thinks out loud, opens phone book) Becker, ... Becker, ...
So, uh, whats your son doing now, Dr. Stevens? Oh, hes a public fornicator. Yes, hes a fine boy...
You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.
You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.
What's happening? What, you doing, come and talk to us.
Good evening, folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--
Mmhu.
Ooo, that was a bad toast.
What happened?
No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?
No, I was following him.
That's the understudy. I'm dating her.
No way! It's completely under my control.
What's over?
There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.
Certainly not.
You got your shirt in my oven!?!
No, shower. So, where are we eating?
Oh, well here. Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it again.
Ahh, Im a 40. Why?
You just said 'Yo-yo Ma'.
Five o'clock.
Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.
Oh, see the baby again with the baby..
No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.
No I can't she didn't leave her name or number.
You can't go wrong with pouty.
Who do you know? He knows my hair.
oh, I d-I don't know. I d---
Alright.
I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.
Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one.
Uh huh
Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am  rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give...
Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give it back to me.
You stink. You know you stink. What is this?
Hey, Happy Birthday.
Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
What are you talking about?
(reluctant) Mr Mandelbaum, I...
I think you'll get it out.
Come in.
No.
What's with you?
Filthy pigs.
Yeah...
What other time?
Uh huh...
Oh, did you get that outta my bag?
What?
What is it?
Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?
That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry.
Nothin'.
Yeah.
I don't think so. Why would I do that?
Kramer! The stone!
Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!
No, I don't.
Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over my side.
No. Never.
Oh, what's the point?
I don't know. So what's this job of yours?
Now, there's a career path you may have overlooked.
I didn't actually want to rent it.
You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!
Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job.
Hi. Ah look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna.
(Pleading) I'm really sorry.
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine...
She doesn't have toe thumbs.
So what plans do you have?
"Jimmy's gonna put the moves on Elaine.."
Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.
Yeah.
(interrupting) Can I talk to you for a second?
That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.
And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya?
It's just hair.
Feel good.
No, I dont.
Larry, wait, you don't understand!
Oh, stop it.
"Jimmy"
Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Just forget it. Let it go.
Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable.
(to the phone) No believe me, Im always up at this hour. How are you?... Great... Sure... What time does the plane get in?... I got my friend George to take me...
It's over there. I know where it is.
Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer enters)
Hello?
So have your parents found out about it?
They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.
He's... trying to get something off his chest.
Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?
And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.
Yeah, Ive heard that about wedding bands.
(to George) Problems with the house guest?
Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid...
It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.
(agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!
What're you, "Joe Hollywood"?
Around eleven.
Okay. (He leaves)
Okay. Hi, Poppie.
Is he gay?
Well you implied it.
Well you've really built yourself up into something.
(interested) Really?
You can't go?
Have you noticed people staring at your head?
We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing.
I still don't know what that means.
(weakly) I dunno
No, I don't have--
(pointing at the operation he mouths the words) Did it go in?
Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why dont you just settle it like mature adults?
I don't know about sixty.
Oh, yes. Particularly if youre not in it.
Oh?
well it's too much, it's embarrassing
So?
Hey.
Hello.
Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.
Okay.. (Opens the door to a frantic Elaine)
Aah, top of the fridge. Hey George, I'm taking that waitress to the Tony's.
Well at breakfast everybody reads.
Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.
(looking ahead) Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh.
aha
I don't want the coat.
(is redialing) I should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.
No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.
Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.
It's not.
Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?
So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?
(Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.
Yeah.. how about this I say "How's it goin'?"
Yeah..... He caught me So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend to look at the coat.
What?
A wallet? Let me see that.
So why don't you leave it at Newman's?
You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
What's the matter with you?
Oh and I've got some things of yours here.
Ah, hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you.
I went out with you.
(going through couch cushions) Where the hell did I put this?
(thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.
Shake is bad, but what if its the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?
But that is not what they would have you believe.
(yell) Move to the back of the drawers!
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.
What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back.
Here we go.
No I can't.
(whips off bag to reveal Indian) Ta-da!
George? What are you doin' here?
(thinking) Whats going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, shes too good to be alone. Whats the difference, I cant maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me.
She asked about you.
Was it pimple popper MD?
No, I don't.
What do you mean?
So, youre back together?
Huh?
Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?
We split it.
If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?
No! Enjoy your lunch.
(To Elaine) It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's unconscious.
Its a good mirror. (They look at their menus.) So, what are you gettin?
Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery.
You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.
Hey, how's he doin'?
All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?
(to George) I mean, come on. (a thought occurs) No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from *Seals and Croft*.
Oh hey Phil.
She said no?
No why?
You know, the Maestro.
Hi.
Oh no. That was the dry heaves.
But thats what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. Theyre knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus.
Okay... but theres no cake or anything, if thats what youre looking for.
Flying Sandos. Beautiful.
You what?
Stolen?
Got 'em on the street, from a scal... (catches himself again)
oh I though you didn't care about his looks
Come on up. Okay, they're here.
I don't know what I was thinking.
You unwittingly made a major commitment. That's a lot of pressure.
Elaine you're missing the whole point.
Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because moneys a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you dont care about money when youre hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, youre like the ruler of an empire. More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives. Then after the meal, you know, youve got the pants open, youve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. Theyre mystified by the check. What is this? How could this be? They start passing it around the table, Does this look right to you? Were not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?
So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.
(Casually, sarcastic) Either way.
Kramer?!
They eat fish.
(pointedly) Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars.
No.
We can only thank God for that.
Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?
Have you tastes the soup?
...You can't put that picture up.
You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.
It was a mistake.
With all the nudity?
So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day?
I'm finding that out. (Kramer enters)
How's life on the red planet? (shuts door)
Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.
We have time.
No, don't stop, Kramer. Keep going, don't let him get away.
Believe me I didn't see anything.
He *had* cancer!
More sheets per roll
Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to go?
Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
We're pathetic you know that?
115.
So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots.
Hey, I got a real thing about "shushing"!
What?!
How about a Napoleon?
Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.
You're still doing that?
Well, Im sure you did. Who wouldnt love a pony? Who wouldnt love a person that had a pony?
Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?
Good to meet you!
Do you even know what this scene is about?
Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.
Under the sofa cushion.
She said what?
(Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine?
And who else is on the show?
Maybe we should call this off.
You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.
(livid) Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one!
You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.
Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane enters)
Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here. (pointing up and down at George)
So when do I meet this jerk?
Is that right?
Nah, I don't think so.
Well, why not?
She likes him I mean she really likes him.
George, I didnt sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. Im just going to be honest. Thats all... Yes, Im nervous... Are you listening to me?... Just put some soap on your finger. Itll slide right off... Then try axle grease... (Kramer enters; to the phone) Ill call you back after I talk to her... Bye.
Then, what was all that sniffing?
Nobody needs to talk.
Oh, wow.
Yeah, that's a point...
He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.
They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
Well, that's your ceiling.
(smiling with pleasure) You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile.
Yeah! Too bad.
Well maybe they were here from before.
What's it doin here?
How many sweaters you got on?
You're not Valerie.
Yeahh.
Nah, it's not for me.
Oh, I got the machine.
What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.
Did you have a good time?
You could be Colin.
Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.
So think you can handle this?
Yeah, my grandma's missing.
Why do we have to leave?
Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?
But you can't act.
Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's leftovers.
That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?
Well, you made me uncomfortable.
Ok, Yeah all right.
Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.
Thank you very much.
He's a boy who lives in a bubble.
Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?
What? Why? What happened?
Hey.
What's the matter?
No, no I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like the title and insisted that he change it to "War and Peace"!
My honest opinion, I think she made it up.
Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?
Just get the key and let's get out of here.
There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?
I guess we'll never know.
What do you expect? It's airline food.
Hi.
(Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off George, and puts it back on his bed)
Hey, how's business?
Get out of here.
Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.
Wow, the whole building burned down.
(walking out) Thanks for having me over, guys.
(To Amy) Aha! So it's true! You were making out with him!
Should I get it? I hate these moments. Im hearing the dual voices now, you know, What about the money? Whats money?
Okay, fine. (Jerry takes a coin from his pocket.) This is the official flip. No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and thats it. Agreed?
I dont know. Its got a pink lining.
Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys.
No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?
Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--
Yeah, me neither.
So she kicked him out of the apartment.
(thinking; quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over this whole operation!
(Shrugs) I - I don't get it.
Yeah, and?
Hey.
Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't get any oxygen.
Uh, sometimes I use the sofa.
Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment for two days. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my parents. they'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own I'm sure it's gonna be some awful dump. Wait a second.. Have you checked in The Plaza yet?
Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is who's responsible for this?
Well, this is it. I'm really gonna do something about my life, you know? You know, I think I'm gonna call Melanie again. So what if she shushed me. GEORGE, I am really gonna make some changes.
Yes I do.
Ill try and remember that.
Who takes care of your boy during the day?
...So how's Noreen?
I'm gonna call the cops. That?s what I?m doing, I?m calling the cops.
Nothing, nothing.
Well, break a leg.
Alright, that's it.. (Grabs Kramer, trying to pull him out of the car)
Here?
You mean what you were wearing?
Elaine, how about this shirt? Is this okay?
Who said theres a problem?
All right, Ill be back.
She could be an 'it'.
(a la "Don Corleione") Elaine, never ask me about my business!.... (SHEEPISH) "Godfather."
Well, you're your own boss now.
Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.
Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg.
(not really) Yeah.
Let me walk you to a cab.
What's going on here?
Maybe he has money.
(Answering to the intercom) Yeah?
About 6-3.
You mean that wasn't uh.
But your were an executive, this is fast food.
Yeah!
First of all, I made plans with Elaine.
Yeah! I think I got flea bites.
...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're there approving new clothes.....That's a girlfriend job! How dare he!!
Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!
Monday, I think.
And it's probably a union thing.
Act I, Scene A..
She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?
World War I plane?
I dont think so.
I don't want it!!
Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
What did you really get?
Kramer there's no way you stick to this.
How you doing?
Why?
And did they suspect anything?
Wow!
So?
You're not feeding him, are you?
What about Susan?
Well, you want your organizer back don't you?
(Stern on George) Not underpants.
Well, what kind of a kiss? Was it a peck? Was it a kiss? Was it a long make out thing?
(Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.
(Obviously resents talking to her) Yes.
Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.
Yeah.. yeah.
Yeah, I did that too.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
How long are you suppose to leave it on for?
(shocked) Broke even.
Oh God!
Did you ask Kramer?
Oh, why?
Well, how much are you going to invest?
Uh-huh.
Congratulations!
The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.
So, you wanna come up for a few minutes?
He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.
I see you, Newman! I see you!
Don't worry Lois. I'll think of something.
Hey. What's with your neck?
The bad fianc&Mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...
I can't. The car's at the mechanics.
If you need more time, you should have more time.
You're like eight years old.
Oh, it's nothing...
I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.
But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?
Okay, okay.
Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. Its completely shrunk. Theres absolutely no way I can wear it.
"Really!"
What else?
Beautiful.
Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not, a chicken.
It's stuck. (pained) Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood.
You had how many dates with him? Three?
They're closed.
Oh, whos gonna know?
Hey.
I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.
Fifty dollars. I Don't Believe This!
Look, you can hang out here if you want.
(scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.
Yea. (pulls at the t-shirt) This is Golden Boy's son Baby Blue.
How did you do those things?
You know I went out once with a nude model. Never let me see her naked. Hundreds of people see her naked every week, except me. Needless to say it was quite vexing.
Dont worry. (whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!... Its Jerry!... Jerry!... From next door!... Never mind where I am!... Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!...
Who is it?
(grabs the ticket back) Give me that.
You did, you did.
I don't know  six three.
Can I take a sweater?
Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.
(about the pie) This is no good.
To spite my parents?
You're a lunatic.
(Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say "Hi", and I say "Hello".
... I just got a postcard from Elaine?
Come on up.
So what did you do there all day?
Beautiful.
You know, this is your coat.
Hey, hey.
What?
Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.
Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?
Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.
Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard.
Youre a human being.
If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
Why? He's harmless.
Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.
They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.
No move. So, you see, its all part of a divine plan.
In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?
No.
Myra, Stan.
Hi Valerie.
How is it a write off?
No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.
Look at this.
Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?
He was a nice guy.
Middle drawer.
(Confused) What does that mean?
(Hands him some mail) There you go. Merry Chirstmas!
How much did you give him?
No, never.
This is Outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit.
How could you swim in that water?
Yeah.
Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something?
Really?
So she tought I did it to get back at her
I can't give details.
We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.
(As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George.
All right lets go. We'll meet you back down here in ten minutes, hopefully with the money.
I forgot about the video.
Why are they settling?
What happened?
Rachel!
Where did you see that? Those are private!!!
Kramer!
Me?
This is how you operate?
Really? Wow.
(TO GEORGE) Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?
Hey, guess what. I just bought my father a Cadillac
Widower? Wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research)
What? No.
What's the matter?
(cutting in) I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman.
(To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. (Gestures to a black Saab)
Those two?
"Oh! How d'you like that?"
Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her!
So how can you promise her?
Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?
Hey, Assman!
(looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!
I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)
No.
(lying) Yes.
This Wednesday?
What about bran?
You got toilet paper on your heel there.
What marathon runner?
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world He's Boring.
Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.
Boy...
You put that in!
Hi. Elaine, it's me.
(answering, quickly) If you know what happened in the Met game, dont say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, Im sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no
Where you goin'?
Really...
Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it.
Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.
Yeah!
Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.
You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?
humm...
I'm locking the vault. What?
What if I don't want it?
You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.
I'm not having this conversation.
Yeah.
So, buy something.
Isn't it common knowledge?
You must be George's cousin.
Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!
(Reasoning) You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place!
(giggling)
Do I what?
Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.
See? You give, and you get.
Thanks again.
Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign.
Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?
Do you have it with you?
Yeah.
Why don't you go to another nail shop?
No lines.
Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
But it's your bodega.
Alright, I'll take it.
(picks up the phone on the coffee table) 555-3455. Well wait a second, don't you see that's 555-FILK.
When did you do this?
Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway.
What?
Well, senator, Id just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it.
I had a very interesting lunch with GEORGE Costanza today.
What?
Alright, come on, lets get out of here.
Face to face.
Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?
It still smells!
Okay. No calls the next day.
It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.
Mmm.. Bad how?
Alright, I'll talk to you later.
Oh, I guess it's broken!
Awwwwww.
So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?
Yeah.
Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.
Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!
I can see that.
Who?
Oy ga-vault.
Of course.
Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?
I don't think that's Salman.
Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?
Ah, he'd just deny it.
There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.
I don't know.
So I assume the jig was up.
So how was the pie?
Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here.
(To George) You're off bread. (To Elaine) So what happened is it over?
(uncertain) Yeah. I'm holding the baby.
I wanna buy back the Cadillac.
No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.
Oh yeah, what? "Buck Naked"?
All right, do you want the quarter, take the quarter, but don't try and tell me it's yours.
(turning on the commercial) Right, quiet dignity. As opposed to, say, this?
How could you ask her out?
Yeah, that's true...
Really?
I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.
(To George) Who picked these out?
Oh, you got something goin'.
(Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after him!
All right, I'll go
Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone.
A pawn shop?
The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.
(hesitatingly) ... no...
Why not?
Why should I have anything for say for myself?
What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?
There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.
I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright*, I forgive you...
Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?
Yeah, I'm sure...
It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?
She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing.
I dont know, I don't feel so good.
Not exactly.
You're damn right you're not buying it!
Aw, these are really strong glasses.
Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.
Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, that's it. They go to the next show.
I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door...
Superfreak?
Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.
He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.
I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)
Hey is the same thing as hello. What do you think Jeannie.
No thanks, maybe some other time.
And who were you tryin to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?
Hello?
No. It's still a goodbye.
I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals.
Hey
What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?
Yeah, hes nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper up to Jerry.) I know, I know. Its down again.
No, I told you I admire your hearing.
Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets.
but not at Dinky.
Is she?
George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?
Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?
Oh, God.
Well you'd be naked of course.
Yea alright.
No.
What's the matter?
Go ahead shake his hand. You're Jerry Seinfeld. You've been on the Tonight Show.
That's it?
Oooh that. Well...
(walking out) Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody.
(accusing) You're not wearing a shirt, are you?
Hey, Elaine.
Elaine, he doesn't need-
I'm gonna grab a can of balls.
Well, its a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.
I don't know. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley..."
But that guy has my jacket.
I thought so.
Elaine, what are you doin' down there?
I never shoulda told you.
Hey.
What?
Are you?
Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?
I'll tell you, that There for you crap was a stroke of genius.
Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.
Well, whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.)
Game over.
(jumps in surprise) Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be gone.
What's with you two?
Maybe we should get you to a hospital.
Another one?
Look, I gotta try and help the guy.
Hey.
You're not writing any letters!
A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?
Great.
Hi Nana.
You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.
No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-
Okay dokey
You're telling me.
You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?
Do you know what this is all about? Do you know, why were here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about We should go out? This is what theyre talking about...this whole thing, were all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, were all out! There are people tryin to find us, they dont know where we are. (on an imaginary phone) Did you ring?, I cant find him. Where did he go? He didnt tell me where he was going. He must have gone out. You wanna go out you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...Then youre standing around, whatta you do? You go We gotta be getting back. Once youre out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, its my feeling, youve gotta go.
Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's got this strangest habit. She eats her peas one at a time. You've never seen anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. I mean, we've had dinner other times. I've seen her eat Corn Niblets. But she scooped them.
Hey.
Just lie down.
What kind of company is it?
So he just sidles up?
It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.
I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
What for?
(acidly) Shes full. So, Big Daddy. Im just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?
It's pompous.
What does he look like?
Two minutes.
Yours or hers?
I do.
It's not necessary.
C'mon, seriously...
Yeah, that was bad.
That's true.
Okay, one victim.
It's really not necessary.
(CONT'D) Hmmm...I thought it was...
This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.
A lot faster than that!
Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?
What are you saying?
What blender? I don't have a blender.
It's nice to meet you!
By the way, just for the record -
Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?
She dumped you?
Really I'll be back.
My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while.
Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men
Right. Go right!/South!
Oh, saffron! That sounds good.
So lemme get this straight you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an clair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, "What the hell, I'll just eat some trash."
There you are. Did you find him?
You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?
How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? Wha, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just sit there going, "Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh, no, another headcase!"
Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?
Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.
oh with huh.. pretty boy.. Tony
These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin' to make that call! (George comes in)
Living or all time?
I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?
What tee?
Here he is... that's the guy! (rolls up window) No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!
Why dont you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps.) Whats wrong?
I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.
Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.
Yes. I do. You show me where there's a can opener in that drawer. (Answers the phone.) Hello! I'm sorry, I'm just fighting with my wife.
Yep.
You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.
Yea.
Tell her you lost your itch.
I don't know.
Elaine, you're among friends.
Tropic of Capricorn?
No no.
What is the big deal?
How could you not believe me?!?
Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!
I hired her from a service!
Joe Divola.
The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.
(shocked) What?
I dont bother with him. Hes been calling me for seven years. Ive never called him once! Hes got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if hes paying attention.
Come on up.
It's Jerry. Who's this?
No spiel?
You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?
Do you want box or hanger?
How come I haven't read about this?
Yeah, I know.
What are their living expenses?
The Improv is playing "Rochelle Rochelle" The musical.
Think so?
You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!
Why now?
(on the phone) hey Andre, get the hell off the phone!
That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.
(confused) The black and white.
Yes, yes, I heard.
Theyre a comedy team.
(While digging in his pocket for some money, he looks over the shirts one last time) You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt..
Oh my God! The break-out/pop-in!
Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.
You know, I don't even know my IQ.
What about skunk?
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president James Polk!" (ELAINE had echoed "Uh-huh. Yup." during it)
Yes. (To Jenny) You're sure there's nothing we can do?
Go ahead, I'll take care of it.
Well, how else could this have happened?
Yes, I'm fine.
Yeah.
No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver.
Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.
(sarcastically) I know!
Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?
I was lying, give it to me!
She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence
Nobody you know...
And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.
Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?
(to the Drake) Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. (To Elaine) Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?
Perfect.
Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?
No.
Hold on, they think you're handicapped?
cool guy? what are you, in 8th grade?
What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?
Oh, please.
Wow good plan.
(sarcastically) Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.
Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, "That's not a bad idea."
But you made it through the day before.
Ahem. Say that again?
Oh, hi dad.
I dont know how Im going to tell him.
You're the man!
No, Trini Lopez.
Too thin?
Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.
No, no, there's no side!
Yes?
I can't.
Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut.
Elaine, have you been talking to her?
(Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.
You're bringing a date to a party?
Oh, that's too bad.
Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?!
It's kinda old, isn't it?
You and me.
My bet? All right. Ill open with a tuna sandwich.
Actually, I haven't heard from 'em yet.
The guy with the lizard.
Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?
Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.
I don't know, this? (Shows his neck to Sara.)
Have you come across this?
Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind.
Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.
Okay.
One second. Hello.
Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)
Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go.
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.
Great - I won.
You're out of your mind you know that.
Well what about me! If you're going like that, I?m not going like this.
Huh?
(stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored)
I get it.
What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!
Hey!
But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.
That's true.
It's a little ...
I really dont need to look.
Yeah, Queens.
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang"...
Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.
Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?
Ready to go Lois?
Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle.
(indifferent) Yeah, we'll see.
Not Pennypacker!
Would do you think?
Really, thank you.
Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.
Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.
Now.
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.
I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.
What're you gonna do down there?
DeSoto? What did he do?
Pam!
Well, did you get the ball?
Yeah.
Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!
He is?
Aah, French fries.
Get going.
Come on Newman. Do it.
Don't look at him. (Phil starts to knock on the door)
I don't care.
Oh yeah.
We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these women.
He fired you?!?
(in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.
That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?
What?
Look...look at this can of tuna!
I had a statue! What should I do?
I didnt know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrants going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesnt make sense. Am I wrong?
Hey.
What noise?
Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.
Yeah.
Yes?
Hey, where's Kramer?
They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record.
What happened? Levitan?
You what?
Shower?
I'm banned?!
Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.
Yeah Ive got this old bottle of cough medicine.
We're here discussing our script with your father.
Famous Original Ray's?
Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?
What's with you?
Right.
So, what's her name?
I thought we were going to the movies?
(pause) It's your third day..
Arent you gonna take it?
Nope, the cop says its my word against his. Theres nothing they can do.
oh! thank you.
I asked. Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian football.
What is that smell?
Boys, boys.
paper goods?
What does that mean?
I only eat cantaloupe at certain times...
I don't know.
Hey, wh-what--
Not even on the book jacket?
Well, let's confront 'em.
No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!
Get me some duty free Kahlua.
Nice to meet you.
No.
Nah, we've seen it.
So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?
Hey, where's Marcy?
That is so Franco.
Bania.
It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.
OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you know you are always welcome in my home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story.
Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)
Hey, there's Elaine.
Hey Drake! Hi Drake!
(muffled) Hi Wendy.
Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.
I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!
I think I got someone!
Yeah, I took her home one night  we kinda started up a little bit in the car.
Would I have to get a gardener?
Oh, how can you be so sure?
(nervous) What?
We're getting vasectomies.
You cried?
Of course. It's garbage.
I'm glad we had this talk.
I know, I know.
Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.
No.
(walking up) Pendant? Those bastards.
So the roommate laughed at everything I said.
They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same.
No.
Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)
No. No you're not.
Oh, really good, really good.
Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.
(calmly getting up with plate of chicken) Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, (drops chicken into sink) was, for two.
I don't know, George.
I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, "Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me." But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?
All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.
Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.
Something huh?
I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?
What? All right, fine.
You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!
Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if its done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels!
Is that right?
I wouldn't worry about it. B-6?
Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump across.
Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model.
We make all these plans - this idiot goes a hundred miles an hour - the whole weekend's over - incredible - just like that -
I didn't know.
Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?
Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again? (listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone. C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me. (hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello.
It is unbelievable.
(going along with it) Oh No!
What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!
So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?
I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
What for?
"Greatest Show on Earth"!
Oh well, thank you, Marcelino.
When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers.
What are you talking about.
Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener - what other conclusion could one reach? (The phone rings.)
If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.
No, hes just a little bloated.
What stock?
Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, thats a good idea.
(taking the menus) Oh, thanks.
Opening.
Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?
(reluctant) Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too.
This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.
Investigation?
Just a huge massive coronary.
I-
She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?
She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults. Things you would know very little about.
Ah, Kramer.
Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it.
Nice to meet ya!
What?
Come on up.
(pointing to napkins; to Elaine) Could I get napkin over there?
Boogeyman.
Mmm, succulent.
Okay.
I don't know.
On many factors.
That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The Mohel circumcised my finger!
(smugly, under-his-breath) Not only that, I broke his thumbs.
But, your father's not bald.
Ooh! Very convenient.
Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.
Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?
Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful.
What am I gonna wear?
Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.
Where are you going?
Plus Im wearing short sleeves, I dont want to expose my tattoos. (Vanessa smiles; thinking) Shes unbelievable!
(Smiling to himself) Beautiful.
Good. And Ill tell you what... You dont have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.
Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!
Danish. Is it from Denmark?
Yeah, yeah.
White Plains.
Yeah, go ahead, take it.
I said, "and more."
A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!
What the hell?
This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy.
Quone?
No, he didn't show up.
Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, Ill see ya.
Alright, alright.
How ya doin'?
We got along beautifully.
Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.
So You're not going?
Frankly, I'm a little concerned.
"I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite."
This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!
You have a girlfriend?
(Joking around) I think it's the stench of death.
Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...
All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.
You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.
Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.
Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.
(pause) I don't know, they just tell you the night before.
What?
Wild pack of teenagers, huh?
Enjoyed yourself.
Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.
Oh, and who might that be?
Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee.
You killed Fredo!
So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.
We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.
And then?
I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
The jewel thief?
Did you look at look at this picture carefully?
Great talkin' to you. (Nina leaves. To himself) What the hell is e-mail?
Hey, what's going on over here?
That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?
No. The sex was fabulous.
(shakes his head) I'm very sorry. (closing the door on Phil. Jerry smiles and shrugs apologetically as Phil stares at them through the glass)
Not getting it.
Where did I take it? Where Did I Take It? (stabbing a knife into a cutting board) Umm, to that place on, uh Columbus and 85th. Okay?
(grabbing the list from Kramer) You're not getting any plantains.
Mr. Fields?
How'd it taste?
Booze is not a religion.
Yeah, I know.
So tonight are you going to make the move?
Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.
Okay, you tell me. What is it worth?
You know I don't even know why I brought you.
Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.
Snapple?
Something wrong with your chest?
I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.
According to them
Hey.
Hello Newman.
Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives. (Picks up phone and dials) Hello Tim? Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you? Well it turns out I can use them. Oh, you do? I understand. Okay. Bye. He already made plans, he can't change them.
What?
(as Kristin is storming out) Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?
(to himself) Last one.
No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.
No.
What?
Yeah.
No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!
I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody up.
Hi!
Hey, how's the anti-mail campaign going?
I'm a comedian.
Can't you just listen to me?
You were livin' in the village then, right?
Yeah?
His eyes look a little cloudy.
Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?
I feel terrible. (Kramer smiling) I mean, Ive seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I cant go any further, but... Shes just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I cant breathe. Its like a drug.
George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?
What's the matter?
Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. Alright, it's time to go. Come on.. Up.
Well, at least taste it.
I can't do those things.
Oh, Oh, the IQ thing...yeah.
I think you scared me straight.
All right. (opens door - Red light floods hallway - a buzzing sound emanates.)
Well what'd you mean?
Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what youre talking about, now, come on, come with me. (stands up) I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.
I'll go if someone else drives. You going?
My god, are you okay?
(thinks) Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize?
I can't believe it.
(stopping them) We better not. (they make out some more; then stop) T-They're gonna be here any second.
Owen March, I never heard of him.
I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.
I said yes.
Oh my God.
Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door)
Shes limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.
Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida.
This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.
Hey. How was the Rainbow Room?
Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.
Seven?
Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.
No, it's part of the contest rules.
Heh.
You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't destroy someone else's.
Just go.
It's all taken care of.
I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
No, I like Mike.
(to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?
Hey Seth. Man it is coming down hard out there.
All right take it easy, just take it easy.
Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle?
That's great!
What happened?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah
But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?
Since when are you treating me to medicine? What are you doing? You're stealing this, aren't you?
You, you're going now?
Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets.
What is that?
I'm right here.
Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.
Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.
Yeah.
Maybe he'll write a song about you.
Babu? (leaving) I'll be right back.
Well. This should be a very interesting evening.
Hey, could you do me a favour? [pause] Could you shut-up?
Aww.
The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.
Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.
Never.
Flowing?
Yeah, and?
I never said I'd do that.
Sit down! Sit down!
What do you mean you're in the same class?
You remember Elaine.
I said yes, but I don't feel right about it. I mean I hardly know the guy. That's a big step oin a relationship. The biggest. That's like going all the way.
Hello.
Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?
Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.
Well this is a great place to sit you got here.
Boy, they really do sound comfortable.
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.
I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.
So you're gonna burn that bridge.
What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.
Yeah, he was nice.
Ah, will you stop it already?
That's what it costs!
No.
Elaine...
Good.
Where did you come up with all that stuff?
But we're in towels.
You cant believe what I just did.
Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?
Heeyyy!...
Let's go.
Dad!
Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met!
Why?
Tremendous workout.
Hi.
Why do you say that?
(stares at George, incredulous) "Back on"? What was it doing off?
Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!
Nah, forget it.
T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya.
Really, Im not answering anymore.
It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck!
Um, who do I make it out to?
All right, just get out of here.
Yes.
Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me (flustered, he indicates a nose pick)
Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it?
He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in.
What happened to you?
Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why dont we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. (All three sit down) Now, look, you both find each other attractive, right?
Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side.
(hurried) Great, bye.
(to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?
I know it was stupid.
C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody.
He's bringing it.
(still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?
Awright, fine. You wanna see it?
(disappointment) Dammit!
I thought we were going out.
No, its okay now, that, that girl is not comin. Uh, I misread the whole thing.
Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--
We are dead.
Whatd'ya mean I stink?
Tell him forty and no fork.
You should try this.
So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.
Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!
So I guess I'll s--
Outside!
I don't know!
Not even once?
What?
Wait a second. (Grabs the icebucket off the counter.) This'll scare 'em off. (Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. Jerry gets back into bed.) Well, good night, Ollie.
What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.
(turning to Kramer) That's nice for the freaks.
Seinfeld.
Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.
Just don't make a scene.
He's going' out with you on Friday?
Obviously.
The flight's been canceled?!?!
Oh, it's enchanting.
The average person in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.
You what? You passed? How could you do that?
(in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine) So did you figure out Darryl's... you know.
You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the "Astonishing Tales of Costanza".
Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine.
I don't know.
Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?
No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.
Come on up.
you know, I think George has a non-sexual crush on him
I don't believe this.
Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?
Oh, Hi.
He's like a squirrel.
What thing?
So you called the cop a pig?
(Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying.
Its just unbelievable.
Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Uh, gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. Alright let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... (looks at Joe; Joe gives him a weird look)ooo, just right... and three plantains uh ought to do it.
Who is it?
Ya he's right here.
Ya i could try and do that.
George is taking it.
Thats your big boy.
Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.
I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?
Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.
I did.
What's going on here?
So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.
But I'm so good.
No, It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago . she's trying to become an actress.
I know, I should've asked her.
Oh. like they wouldn't have found that anyway.
Hi Sarge.
Seinfeld.
Hey, hey! I'm with someone.
Hey.
Ah
Audrey.
Will you marry me?
You know I can't get this *damn thing* to sleep. (about the Yo-Yo)
No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.
I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.
Hi.
Do you ever win at poker?
Kramer!
George-
You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
I think I saw one a coupla doors down.
What's with you?
What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. "I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other people. You won't be around me. But you will be around." "Take care now." Did you ever say that to somebody? "Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now." "Take care. Take care." What does this mean? "Take off!" Isn't that what you really want to say? "Take off now."
Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it!
Oh, beautiful.
What do you need salsa for?
Maybe you should check with the rabbi.
Do you hear this clunking?
I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.
[whispering] No, no news. You better get out of here.
Aw, come on there now.
Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.
We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.
Come on up.
Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you.
I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.
Was it in the trash?
So youre pretty much
Babu must be back.
No, no, I...
Course not.
She's not there. She's doin' her wash.
Could we stop?
No, a dollar, two tops.
Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)
Yeah
(trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.
That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.
Well, I . . . [sees George]
I dont know.
Yeah!
Ah...that's a big responsability on your hands.
George, the phone's free.
Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.
That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?
Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.
No I don't.
Uh, you know, why dont you go first, you just had a long trip.
Yeah?
This is my friend George.
I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.
Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.
Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.)
So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here.
(excited) Oh, my little airplane lamp.
How could you leave a message like that on my machine.?
Ill call Kramer. He can check my house.
First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.
Wait a second, don't you--
Five, ten minutes.
I have an instinct for these things.
(Leaving) Right back at ya, Slick.
Come on up.
Are you alright?
Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.
She's got a fine cheek.
Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?
(talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass.
Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.
You think we can do it?
Can you blame her?
It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.
No. Why?
(on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel! (hangs up the phone very disappointed)
I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...
Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
Oh, no, no, no, wait a second, wait a second th-th-that--
I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)
Where do you want to go?
Inside out! Great.
Thanks.
(pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you lay it out on the bed.
I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it.
(Saddened) Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.
I'm blown away.
She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator...
I would like to know what my names doin in this creep's organizer to begin with.
(indicating the woman) Game, set and match, huh Milos?
Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!
Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.
It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
Look Kramer, i-i-if I'm gonna live over there, y-y-you gotta take some of this stuff out. I mean this thing is really freaking me out (holds up a ventriloquist dummy). I feel like its gonna come to life in the middle of the night and kill me.
Kramer , there's no way you're sleeping with me.
You plunked him.
You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal(sp?) before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.
Alright.
The Fleckman.
Oh, the dolphin thing?
Leave a message, Ill call you back.
Yeah, well, it's honest.
I don't think so.
Oh.
(Noting) You know, I've never seen you drive.
Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) Thats it. Done!
No, supermarket.
(picking up his bag and coat) Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?
Well, you look, uh...relaxed.
Kramer. (boom sound)
So, what ever happened with that?
Well, it's kinda silly, but..
I'm kinda in the middle of something.
He feels he's funnier, more relaxed.
No.
What?
Well, if that's not that, what is that?
So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George?
Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?
See what?
Like what?
Rabies.
Bye. (Hangs up)
Oh my god, you're kidding. (dives for his wallet) Hang on a second. (reading from his registration) It's JVN 728.
(Nodding, trying it out) "I'm there for you."
All right. As long as youre okay. Because I cant stop thinking about her.
What if it gets in the side?
No, not particularly.
So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.
The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.
All right.
Well, so it wasn't a total loss.
Watch out!
Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?
All right! I'll do it. The race is on.
George Costanza is your mentor?
(Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?
Elaine got a new number because she died.
Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.
What's taking him so long out there?
All right, I'll see you later.
What?!
So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.
Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?
Oh, what are you talkin' about?
(pointing at TV) Hey, that's her!
This is Jerry Seinfeld.
I said luss. Im at a luss.
Kramer!
Yeah maybe you should.
Yknow Im sorry you had to leave so early the other night.
(applying paste to brush) Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.
So, are you going to leave?
I believe he is wearing a cape.
Yeah. Pretend like it never happened.
Wouldn't tune in.
Could I just buy an umbrella?
We? No.
Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you.
I long for you?
Right now.
Disorder?
Will you stop it already?!
Hi.
I've got a black eye.
Wow.
That was Keith.
(muffled) There you go.
Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.
Have a good time.
Looks like there is?
I didn't even use the ticket!
Did you two break up?
You wanna grab lunch?
Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.
Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.
(To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up)
Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
George, who is that woman in the stripes?
Hello, Newman.
Hey.
Suspected serial killer, he didn't actually do it.
How are you gonna do that?
I have no idea.
What is it she think you can't do?
Hey.
Especially when you got a layover in Sarajevo. (Bosnia Herzegovina)
Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.
(getting looks from his parents) Not you. Older people.
I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem.
You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.
I'm sorry.
What are you doing? You're choking me. Elaine!
That voice. That voice. Shes driving me crazy.
Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.
You'll never say that to her face.
Oh, my God. Did he get fired?
Why not?
Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.
I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.
Well, I don't normally--
(Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.
Yeah.
Well you gotta call your parents.
I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
(doing the voice) Good-bye Kramer.
No.
Because you're a woman!
Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.
Thats comforting. Shh. Hes coming. (to Ray) Ray?
Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly) and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it.
They deliver the coal?
And that waist cincher, that was the topper!
Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear?
But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.
(pulling on a jacket) Mmm-hmm.
Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.
(quiet) Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..
What are you talking about?
This is a person I like, its not How to score on spring break.
Unbelievable!
(To Katie) What is the complication?
Hi Julie.
Why?
Told you.
The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)
Really?
Whatley. (Like "Newman")
You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder?
Newman! She went out with Newman!
Sure.
Oh no, nothing.
(shocked) What the hell was that?
Ya, I could see that.
Reversed positions?
Yeah, I know that!
I didnt open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.
Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may depend on it.
Me?
Yeah I guess I do owe you.
Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened. (listens) Well, I think you should. Okay, bye.
I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.
(Nervous laughter) Yeah.. like a pirate.. (Attempting to get on another subject) Anyway, ah, you know, we're hoping to, um, raise enough money.. with this.. uh..
I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.
So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?
Bob Cobb.
No...
Australia?
All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.
No.
Lomez is Jewish?
A pinkish hue?
You look like Brenda Starr.
Uh huh. When youre on a stakeout, do you find its better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?
Oh, whatever.
Don't blow this.
(Reading it) "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." - What is that?
..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beveridged!
Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drakes coffee cake
It's silly!
What?
Really?
You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.
Elaine, George (introducing them to Bania with less enthusiasm)
Hello.
They're looking.
All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?
Hey, Tim. Great party.
What'd you do to your hair?
What's that?
Eh, people, people are talking.
So, you like him.
You and George got together?
Darren?
I'm Dylan Murphy.
With her hands.
Hello. Didn't I see you at the pro shop yesterday?
Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?
Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner
Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.
(Interrupts) Excuse me...Excuse me... Are you asking him out ?
Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.
Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.
No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.
Mona a Baldo .
Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.
You what??
She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.
Ya, 1397.
Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?
Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?
Good, good.
(exasperation) You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents.
Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding?
Oh, the best revenge is living well.
40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?
Come on up.
Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin?
Well, what's wrong?
Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?
Okay, just hand that over, please.
Yeah.
Where are they moving to?
Why not?
. . . All right (gritting teeth) Just give me the ticket.
Uhm, hold, hold on a second. (pauses counting) I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.
I was hoping you'd offer. (The intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.
What? Today? Really?
Done what?
No deal. Why?
Ya?
You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!
See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think?
Aw.. right, code of silence.. how's that going?....Ha!!...
Kramer, what are you doing here!?
Something, isn't it?
Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!
I like to use my own material.
L.A.?
Ohh ... (takes the ticket and heads for the dressing room)
Oh.
It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.
I don't know. Where have you been?
You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!
Hello.
An old friend of mine, whom you may have met, George Costanza, has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formally a highly placed official with an outfit known as the IRS. And as we speak, at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information. And she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise.
I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?
"I don't think so."
Who is this?
Is it...? Could it...? Could he have...? IT IS! (Grabs Kramer.) Poppie peed on my sofa!!
Yeah.
It can't be worse than this.
Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please.
It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?
Yeah.
That's the rule.
You can do that.
Well my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.
Hold on a second.
Buyer beware.
Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday?
What's wrong?
What do you mean you show up?
But he was squinting.
Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.
How do you know?
I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.
I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad?
He'll get another job. He's a busboy!
Youre gonna get back together, anyway. Its thousands of dollars!
So, George...
Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for? I don't know about that, I'll have to think about it. I'll let you know. Okay, bye.
(dismissive) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I want everyone out!
Okay.
So what does he care if you put lifts in?
Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice.
Oh, so hopelessness is the key.
Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.
Pull over? The lieutenant is waiting to see us.
(leaving) You two keep an eye on each other?
Who do I know who would have even been in a limousine yesterday anyway. Uhh-O h-owow!
So are you...
No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.
Yes, I will.
I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
Oh...well...
Fine.
No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.
Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.
All right, fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone)
You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola!
But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.
You have a standard fake?
So you're not gonna come?
(nods) Look, postcard from Elaine from Europe.
Jim Fowler? The animal guy from "Wild Kingdom" is coming to your apartment?
yeah. I think I do.
What?
40.
Now, its time to go.
(shouting) Man that thing is noisy!
What?
I don't know.
She's like a beautiful Godzilla.
Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.
All right. Take it back.
What do you recommend besides the steak?
(kidding) Uncle Leo?
So the squirrel's gonna make it?
You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.
They cross the wires or something.
You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married.
Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.
Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.
He's writing copy?
Where did you get that butcher's coat?
Tuberculosis
So?
You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. (Picks up the phone.) She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...
Hey, Elaine.
And?
(facing the lengthening line behind him) Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.
I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! **
I missed you.
(pointing Kramer) "To wit"
How is this an emergency?
You've tasted them?
That stinky old movie-house?
(ironic outrage) The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!
No, its no problem at all.
No, why should I? I wear boxers.
But you can never keep a secret.
Well this is it.
Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.
Gimme that rye.
Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.
You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-
So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER
I strained my neck last night.
What am I saying?
We didnt bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.
So I know this guy. Im getting all my sneakers at a discount now.
Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.
Yup.
Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?
(Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So, the last person in should close the door!
(after a very awkward pause, cheerily) Hey, neighbor.
Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in.
Uhn-uh-uhn - Uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer A-Ha ha! Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe. (singing) dee, de-de, de-de-de-de-de (Makes G.I. Joe swim off, legs kicking)
Yeah.
Do you want it?
You cannot buy half a can of soda.
See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.
I was out.
So you want me to get the books? Is that it?
Astronaut!
Why?
So you're pretending to be a tourist?
(pointing Kramer) He drank it.
Still no Puddy?
(doubtful) I don't know, do you have a--
Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-
Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?
How come?
Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.
You did?!
No, I do not challenge.
Oh I'm stressed! (makes like Kramer, outstretching his arm. Jerry heads for the freezer for some ice cream.)
Gee, I just didnt expect it from the way youve been acting.
Oh, my god!
Oh look at this guy.
No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
Yeah, I think I do.
What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage death match.
I don't know, but you don't have it.
(confused) What?!
What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?
OK, I blame you.
No, I just wanted to see what time it was.
If not now, when?
No body said youre fat. Hes a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy.
(hands up) I don't want it that way.
Oh, that's a drag...
I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back.
You two know each other?
Lippman?
You tried Aaron, it was too expensive.
So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm gonna try to sell the van to a lot.
Elaine.
[rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your point!
Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.
What?
It's been known to happen....... telling you right now Elaine, this guy 's gonna dangle that dress in front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule.
What's going on?
Uh huh.
Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.
Are saying you're banning me from the store?
Yeah.
No, I don't think that..
Ah, George turned it down.
That's enough!
Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)
What for?
So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out Im giving you a raise.
Well, I am sure I had a good reason.
What are you doing here?
(shock) What?!
Who is it?
I can't believe this.
(pointing to Elaine) Her father wrote that.
(to Elaine) And where were you?
(Still pulling on Kramer's pants from the ankles) Man these are tight. (Yanking) Squinch your hips in
(scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.
You're not a writer.
Hm.
Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
I dont know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three oclock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someones door and tell them to keep it down? Youre really altering your whole self-image. I mean, what am I, Fred Mertz now? Whats happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. Theres a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh... shh... shhh... shhh... Doesnt work, cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me. Some people you cant shush in a movie theater. Theres always that certain group of people, isnt it? Theyre talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They wont shush. Theyre the unshushables.
(continuing unphased) You wanna get the other end, cause I wanna get it in the hall.
Oh hi, Katie.
(quietly) Oh, he's this awful comedian.
Hey, is that my maple syrup? Oh, ya. (Kramer hands it over.)
Technically, you're sauted. So, what are you doing for that?
Who's that?
Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, You think?
The coffeeshop?
She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
You just said you wanted it!
Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.
Well, this is all very sophisticated.
No.
(Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here?
All right we'll wait for you.
No good?
No, no, the--
You mean he just
Oh, that's bad. Especially that area.
Did what?
How much?
Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about it!
UNDATEABLE!
Let's see what he says.
(Smiling, nodding) Sure, Saturday night.
No.
No good. Too many people know the combination.
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little...
I don't want to trade.
Elaines thing? How you gonna get in?
Maybe we should go.
The wedding is off? What happened?
Look at him.
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers...
Well I think that's pretty obvious.
Bon voyage, Lainey!
You know youre funcifying the whole building.
Oh, now you're being ridiculous.
I think theres a mental hospital near here.
Hey.
Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up) Since I said what?
What?
Does what?
It's like watching an animal get tortured.
So why don't they talk like that now?
Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer!
What about her name?
Are you sure?
Hi, Mr. Abbott.
Give me that wave!
Are we about throw here Newman?
The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.
Great!
This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
Ah hah, alright, let's go.
George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality.
You picked up on a vibe, from a nun.
What's this?
Hello.
May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" across the painting)
She died.
So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show, I waited for you, you never came.
So you hurt Vincent's feelings?
All right, so I had wooden teeth, so what?
It did?
Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.
Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit.
The Charlie Macarthy hearings.
I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.
OH! Hey!!
See you later
They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives.
Good body, nice body.
Birds?
You'll be out before we get the check.
Give me another shot!
The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.
He pulled an LBJ on you.
(reading note) Oh my god!
A mental institution?
Kramer!!! (Jerry points to the lamp post they are about to crash into)
Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the verge of this big promotion?
Oh, he's coming.
Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.
Yeah.
Could be.
What if it's your hair?
You have no idea.
Oh, I didn't do anything.
George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.
I don't believe it.
Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.
Can I get anybody anything?
How did you get my package?
I, I'm not happy with what I wrote.
Hey, good luck with that.
Oh, no, the woods! The hole!
Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. (holds his nose up like a pig) You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.
So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!
I know.
Honey, what'd you do with the can opener?
Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.
But gymnastics is not for everybody.
What?
Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?
How did I gain eight?
How about our little Elaine huh? Attended the finest finishing schools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions. Debutante balls. Look at her now. Interviewing Mohels.
Thats different. I didnt have feelings for those people. But you, youll backslide
I can tell you what to do.
A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see 'em. Come on, I'm calling! (thumps hand on table) What d'you got!
Hey ,You think that Shelly's upset that I made such a big deal about the pecan.
Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer.
Kramer?
We dont have two seconds?
I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?
What do you want?
(pause) Oh. Big deal..
Yeah.
Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy.
Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.)
Hey - hey - hey!
(waving his arm in dismissal) Eh.
Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Caf Latte?
You got it ALL wrong. I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoans
Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.
Maybe I should ask her out?
I gotta say, thats pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.
Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.
Puffy.
And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.
Youre imagining this. Really.
I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!
(quiet annoyance) I don't write skits.
Uncle Leo?!
Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.
Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in!
So, what did she do?
I hear it's ah beautiful there.
Gary?
(Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.
(doing the voice) Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!
No, thank you.
So Marcelino's going to take down the check?
I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
this is Jane Elaine
In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.
Hello?
Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing?
I told you to take it.
Scary cold.
Thats all there is to it.
Not bad.
So you're not gonna come back to New York with us?
Oh, sure...Truman Capote.
I don't know. Who could've been in my apartment.
Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.
You put blood in the car?!
Yes.
No thanks.
Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going "Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going."
Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.
(apologetic) Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.
Thank you.
Well, I'm glad I brought it up.
Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.
I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.
No, I don't have any ashtrays.
Are you kidding?
It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.
The massages are out!
Everything?
It-it rhymes with a female body part.
Turn up the heat in your apartment! (opens a window)
Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?
Wow! That's amazing!
Yeah, it was a gamble.
One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub.
Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.
I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers.
Yes, come on! How often do you get engaged? Come on!
So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.
Yeah, did a good job.
Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.
I don't know.
You'll chicken out at the last second.
Ah, just, you know, I don't know. Stuff, I gotta do. (grabs coat and throws it over his shoulder)
Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?
I'm going to be this guy's friend.
I was merely speaking extemporaneously.
Tuberculosis
Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe-- "Jerry Jerry Dingleberry", and-hu "Seinsmelled"...
Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.
Oh! but I do. There's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar. ( as he says this Newman is wildly scratching behind his back. he suddenly stops when Jerry turns around)
Good morning.
Who would order a license plate that says "Assman"?
Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.
Why are you buttering your face?
What's that perfume you're wearing?
Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
No.
The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California!
Eh, show biz...
Yeah. Im having a wonderful time. (it's obvious he isn't)
Im not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want.
It's like 10 minutes by subway.
(as Ping rambles on ) ...S'cuse me (Ping looks up) Kind of an expensive call.
Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. (standing) I'm going to the bathroom.
You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!
Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.
George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long.
So... did you stop by the dojo?
Well why don't you say it?
That's great.
No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
Who is that woman?!
Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?
(returning to the table) Remember Babu Bhatt?
Hey!
(long pause).......Sure. ( humms a song then stares at the toothbrush)
There's a squeeze ketchup.
That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up. (phone rings) Excuse me one second.
Yeah. (pointing at Elaine as he goes into the bedroom)
But you like your Joel Rifkin.
The chip-in!
(cuts in) A nude model.
Is it me?
Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?
I don't know how you do it.
Yeah.
Well wh..wh.what are you doing?
TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.
Aaaaahhh...!!!
oh my god
What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time
Ah, really.
Yea, ya, so...anyway what was I talking about.
(incredulous) I gave you a hundred dollars?!
Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight!
You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it)
He looks like you and he's working from the inside?
(tearing through his laundry bag) Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on, let's go.
A bad side, an ugly side.
To see a movie.
No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy.
Well what happened?
All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, "It's been real," move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.
Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.
Is he being coy?
(Pleading) Really, gentlemen, please.
I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship?
(to Mickey) Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?
The main thing is to keep the line moving.
Well, what'd you say?
I don't know, regular human time?
Why? What did I do?
Yes, the hole!
Oh yeah. This can't miss.
I'd like to be.
Oh!.It's an affectionate caricature.
I woulda taken you to the airport.
You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem.
For either one of us..
Wow! (hitting George)
Is this a problem?
Great, I had fun. Wheres the TV, wheres the VCR?
Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.
It's not one of those 976 calls, is it?
Oh, how come?
Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress.
Come in, we're taking a break.
Maybe a Cadillac.
Ya sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? (Meryl laughs. The owner of the coffee shop comes over.)
Yeah. Yes, she is.
All right, I gotta go.
Yeah, pretty damn good one, too!
You're a lucky guy.
So, Im gettin the insiders deal?
So?
What are you repeating everything I'm saying?
Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD.
George?
What?
You said "you little phony"?
(Excited) I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!
He is merry, I'll give him that. (notices a cactus on the table) What's this plant for?
Yes.
(singing) Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home.
Oh, sure, yeah.
'51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?
Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and find my number.
Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number.
Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.
All right. Let's just drop it.
(hanging up the phone) Oh! There's my Chinese food, I gotta run. All you.
An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. (Elevator doors open) Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. (Everyone but Jerry is now in the elevator. Jerry's still addressing them) Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?! (Elevator doors shut. A few people in the hallway are looking at him, he turns and addresses them) I am not an animal!
You sure? You look a little pale.
Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!
What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.
Mmm
Now, how could that be good?
So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is better?
For crying out loud, He's Superman. (Fulton stops laughing, Jerry's face is stunned) Fulton? (looks at him) Fulton?
Well Cindy, the place looks great.
So, is tonight "the night"?
'The ocean called, They're running outta shrimp'?
No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.
Whew. Did he wave?
H-Hey, Kramer, wait up. I'll go with you.
"The Switch."
Really?
Why don't you get a new sofa?
At your apartment?
No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.
Is it something I said?
The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.
Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes outside)
Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.
He has no idea who you are.
Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime.
Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?
Yeah right.
I'M NOT DOING YOUR BITS!!
Yeah, maybe.
Pinter?
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
Better.
Did you hear something?
Nice looking Lugar.
(unheard by Jenna) When the battery runs out.
Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again?
That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.
We're only kidding!
Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.
Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that?
Oh my god, he knows. (Jerry and Gino scrambling) Go. (yelling to the door) One second.
Seth! Wow what has it been like five years?
Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars?
Who is it?
It's Patty.
(in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room) Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad, you look so different.
Elaine!
Sorry, I don't have any cash.
Confucius, huh?
Its mostly water weight.
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.
Hello.
(Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.
(opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?
Well, I take it very seriously.
Oh so you still don't believe us.
And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?
Oh, were meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building.
You want to get something to eat first?
Soon, there's a couple of problems.
Its very good cantaloupe. (Kramer leaves; to George) So thats it? Youre out?
Yeah. (disappointed)
What?
I'm trying.
I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...
If you feed him, he'll never leave.
So you dont know whats wrong with him?
No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman.
It's wrong, it's rude, and it's incorrect.
Hey.
I don't blame you. I blame myself.
Im gonna make an appointment for you. Well go together.
(answering machine) leave a message and I?ll call you back, thanks. JOE DIVOLA Jerry, Joe Divola. *Pbt* *Pbt* *Pbt* I have a hair on my tongue, I can't get it off, you know how much I hate that? Course you do, you put it there. I know what you said about me Seinfeld. I know you badmouthed me to the execs at NBC, put the kibosh on my deal. Now I?m gonna put the kibosh on you. You know I?ve kiboshed before, and I will kibosh again.
I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work.
Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em.
Why did he fire her?
Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.
Miss.
Youre too nice a guy.
Koko?
How does she know Marisa Tomei?
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
Me too!
All right now you listen and you listen good! (he grabs Kramer's legs and throws him down the couch)
Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to 'em. Mind if I walk through real quick?
He could have said "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.
I dont know how this happened.
When you hear like a soft russeling.
Yeah!
Not you.
What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?
Oh! man did you see that. I ate discarded food.
Allow me. What are you, an idiot?
Maybe you can just go back.
Boy, your really packing it all in.
Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.
There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.
Nothing. I'm sure "Jon" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! (Laughs uproariously.)
I think Ive seen enough.
Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.
So you didn't get the job.
Oh. That's not quite the same.
And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.
I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!
I'm looking forward to it.
... Oh, Im joking.
What is that smell?
I was out in the snow last night.
(not enthousiastic at all) Oh, sure. Danny.
Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the check to Elaine) look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.
Ooh, nothing.
No thanks, just the check.
Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish...
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
So you didnt ask?
Ya.
Aw, looks just like you.
We cold play Sorry! We cold play Steal the Old Mans Bundle. (Vanessa not amused; Jerry thinking) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to Vanessa) What kind of perfume is that youre wearing?
Why'd you get him a gift anyway?
I don't read in the bathroom.
Yeah, it's me. Kramer found the car!
Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.
I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
Yellow? I wanted black.
You have to know, you must know.
Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.
Good work Kramer, this is incredible.
(opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.
I mean I'm happy sometimes, but-but not now.
Entertainment Tonight's on.
I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.
That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?
Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.
Oh my eh, my Aunt's name is Mulva. She's-she's a masseuse.
I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.
In his dreams.
So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?
Why are the crepes spraying?
Yeah. Eighteen strangles.
George, is this funny?
Yeah but theres a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet.
There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?
I'm laying down! Then we'll see how he does up there, without all the assistance.
Fantastic.
I know look at this [shows ad]
"No no you said George likes spicy chicken."
(To himself) Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. (George doesn't react) What's the matter?
What do you mean?
Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?
No I didn't.
Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
I got your message, (sitting) so I came straight from Atlantic City.
Amy said nothing happened.
What is the matter with you?
Stakes?
Ohh, will not cause drowsiness"
Do you believe that guy?
oh.. whoa..
(answering the buzzer) Yeah?
Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?
She got the promotion?
Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other?
We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.
Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.
You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!
Yeah, it's one of my favorites.
The Portuguese waitress?
Oh, yeah.
I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck.
Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls down, make it an eight room luxury suite.
Yeah, I saw the spot.
South America?
Nah...
Well, the mans an individualist  he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what hes doing.
Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?
Did you steal my car?
Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...
I'm on the phone!
No more mentor?
No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble..
I don't know what you should do with it.
That's a good one. Dentists.
5-19? What's a 5-19?
Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?
How'd it go?
Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.
Aah.
Ey, ey!
It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.
Yeah.
The bris?
Was there a red-headed guy there?
Just put a coffee table book over it.
Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!
Oh. Sorry, I didnt know..
"How's George?"
I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.
Yeah, well, it won't be long.
Oh, no?
Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun.
Nothing's happened.
So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!" So he says to me, "What are ya gonna do about it?"
Ok. Uh
So get this we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.
Is this even a road?
Well, that all depends. . .
Between Poland and Morgan?
I thought we were talking about me.
Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.
Art Cor...
But you don't smoke.
Musicians. Get a real job.
Well, theres this uh, woman might be comin in.
Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. Its the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... (Jerry pushes the door shut.) ...MUST BE CLOSED!!
Just chatting. Friendly.
Oh, all the way.
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
(under his breath) Well, this worked out just as I had hoped.
Statute of limitations. It's not a statue.
And that guy is your new boss?
... as long as one of them is not him.
You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?
Ya, that's the.. last thing you want to see. Well, next to last.
Would she mind?
I'd be very interested in something like that.
Well...
Counter.
What is it?
No, no, it was a small ceremony.
I just thought ahh maybe I could talk to Roy, if um
Let me in, it's me. (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the dressing room) Here. You don't know what this is costing me. (hands Kramer the ticket)
Expect a call.
Yeah, that's a good tip!
So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else in real estate?
He's eighty!
All right were coming down.
Sample? (under his breath) Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book.
Yes, yes, you have.
You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.
So? Wheels?
Right, Thursday three o'clock.
Moved?
Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.
That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice.
Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!
Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. (George laughs) So, when do you move into the apartment?
(To George) Well, it's not about nothing.
Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
Swimming?
(Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing is now?? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!
I want this baby fully loaded. (listens) Well, how soon can you get it there? (listens) Oh, that's terrific. (listens) Okay, thanks, bye.
That's not bad.
Yeah.
Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired.
Youre doing this yourself?
Elaine!
A bigger bill?
Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..
Alright, its time to go.
No.
(sharp) I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.
I wouldn't know where to start.
How you doing?
He might die.
Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.
Theres nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.
Oh sure.
(thumbing through his mail) Uh oh.
I love a parade!
Tails!
Well, she framed it and everything.
They really stick to that understudy rule.
You feel better?
It's early.
So, you won't eat the pizza?
Had I been taking...?
Forget it.
Hey, hey, what are you doing, that?s my quarter.
Ya?
So what are you gonna do?
Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail.
Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
Uh...I got married.
Yeah, see you there.
Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide.
Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off.
(calls) Hey, I'll take one.
(Remembering) Oh, right. The big party..
I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?
Well, I'm not.
She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.
Live?
That's so strange.
Okay..
Ah. (makes face)
Oh, we all hated him.
No, he's still stuck at the foundation.
Wait, he stopped, he's parking.
Good luck, It's sold out for the next three weeks.
Well I can see it.
Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.
Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse.
All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.
In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.
Hey. So, keys?
Oh yeah, Sfuzi? I- I've gotta do that.
No. I'm waiting for...
Yeah, he's a real phony.
Best friend- Ive never been to your apartment.
The tooth brush in the toilet bowl.
(fetching a drink from the fridge) Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.
Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a, its a little crumpled.
Elaine? How did you rope her into this?
Well you know what this means, don't you?
Why do I seek your counsel?
'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'.
What?
Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and put it in.
Why, what's wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders)
Kramer, I can't believe we're grave robbers.
Shut up, you old bag!
Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time.
Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.
(in a hurry) Ya how you gonna get all this done in time?
No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first.
(disgusted) Ohh! You know, and sometimes shell go, (imitates Marlene) Hello, Jerry? And Ill go, Oh, hi Marlene. And then its Jerry...
So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!
Cookies?
Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips.
It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse "ha's." You know those?
Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.
He called the right guy.
Welcome back to the show.
Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?
You know what's good for that? Relish.
What was the dream?
If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber.
You know last time you had me throwin' a rye bread up three floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off your car, where does it end?!?
Absolutely
Yeah.
Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
(annoyed) All right. (after a pause) Hey, you know what's weird?
Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.
My grandfather gave me a statue!
Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?
What about me?
Hey, did I make it?
I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.
You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.
Ask him to change it.
No eight years isn't such a long streak.
Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?
I think I heard her say something about a bench.
Why dont you ask that doctor what it is?
Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.
So have I.
What's the harm?
This weekend. WOW!
What's the rope for?
Maybe you won't like it.
Look.
Pride?
I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?
I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses!
Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.
Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?
Where?
Franco's no good? ...They got no team leaders.
Well, for one think, don't listen to him.
What?
"Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable..." Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been "outed"! I wasn't even "in"!
He's fantastic.
How can you talk to someone like that?
This is Laura.
(A couple of days ago I used a public phone), go over time on the call, hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, "Yeah, operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?"
Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her Im sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.
Tonight?
You said "gloves"...
Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy.
Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton. **
Well, it's been a great visit.
Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex.
Who's she?
So he's an eligible receiver.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, whats going on?
I dont know what to do.
Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?
Yes.
Really?
No. No. I don't mind at all.
Plus, you know what else.
But its common sense. Hes got super strength, super speed. Im sure hes got super humor.
"I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat."
Hello, Charles.
I, dont see it happening.
The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke. (The phone rings.) Thats probably Uncle Leo.
Oh really? (tries turning away in the hopes Elaine gets the hint; thinking) Oh God, I gotta get out of this.
Hi. Can I use your bathroom?
The dog. You're getting the dog.
(In awe. Whispering) The botched it?
She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...
Bye.
I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.
You know what the odds are on a crash it's a million to one.
Why not?
Well, just give it back, and I wont say anything.
(to Kramer) Oh! Shut up!!!
Alright.. (Takes his coat off)
What is she making?
(seems sincere) Yeah, I'm really sorry, uh.
This has 'international incident' written all over it.
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!
(explaining) I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.
(To George) Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?
Yeah.
Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha.
What look?
Oh, that's okay.
Oh, I'm delighted.
Fred?
The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.
Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!
Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, "Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. " "What are you watching?" "I don't care, I gotta keep going." "Who was that?" "I don't know what it was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going." Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, "Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel." You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, "Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of here. I'm going to bed."
How up to date?
Yeah.
House in the Hamptons?
Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.
Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really.
Come on,
(Bravely) Well, what if I deliver it?
Soon as I get off the phone wih you.
Cup of tea with lemon.
The Kavorka? Whats that?
No, I didnt!
No social reason for them to be here.
Sons of bitches?
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
Where did you get this thing?
Good.
No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!
But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.
(leaning round Kramer) Where?
Alright, Kramer!
All right, I'll see you later.
Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out?
That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.
(seeing Fredo's tombstone) Oh, my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up! (hands the shovel to Kramer)
(to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?
I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?
What are we doing out here? Aren't we going to go in and eat?
I think it's tamber.
So it had nothing to do with you.
Uh, good.
(confused) We're talking about people, right?
Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?
Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?
And you don't...
Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.
Hello.
You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em.
I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)
Oh my god.
There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing *just* a bra. I can't get that image out of my mind.
I like it tucked.
Well I don't want to take too much off.
You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?
(Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?
Good idea. (Jerry calls Barry's office)
Why?
But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.
Solid.
(sarcastic) Thanks for stopping!
What?! How?
Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much. (To Kramer) I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!
What is it?
I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)
You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for?
No, not a thing.
(aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?
How do you know?
Why wouldnt he?
Oh, that's nice.
(consenting) Alright.
(In pain) Oh, are you about done?
Hi,
All right, I'll see you after school. I,,m late for Hayman's hygiene.
O.K. (Kramer leaves.)
Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?
You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go 'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.'
Ah, don't worry. I made reser... (catches himself)
You're behind in the count.
What, what is wrong with her?
Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.
It's good to have you back.
Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order)
Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.
Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.
Ya, it's much better isn't it?
This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.
How could you go in there?
(Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did!
Yeah, there's a new one in there.
Well, this is it. Im selling.
You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. And you can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. Then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin' Alright, gimme everything you have, too''.
You're not late.
Have you ever been through an audit?
You've caught your mother opening envelopes!
You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.
Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.
But why? Why McDowell?
some mouthwash, a hat, something.
Well Im glad it's working out.
Definitely. Well, goodnight.
She's also quite bold.
Hey.
*Oh*, you mean you wanna *lose* it...
Of what?
I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?
(Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?
.....Stupid , stupid.
Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.
(laughing) What for?
I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.
George NO!!
( embarrassed laugh) ...Oh! Damn..
OK.
Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.
Oh, there you are!
Alcohol.
How did he find out?
I sure do miss my apartment. Maybe I'll switch back.
Hello Elaine? Patty Lawrence had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?
*I* don't like you!
Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.
Hey, are you still wearing those things.
Bender.
It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
Yeah. You said you liked horse manure.
What?!!
I thought you just said she doesn't know??
Yeah.
Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
I'm gonna ask this guy something.
No, I don't drink coffee.
The Drake is good!
Morning.
Thank you.
You're not paying for it.
(to Rava) So, wheres this boyfriend of yours? I cant wait much longer. Ive got a flight.
I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--
Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!
What's the matter?
See ya.
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?
(unenthusiastic) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) Im just, Im really glad youre here.
Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.
Hello.
So I can see her tonight, and you dont care?
No kidding. (thinking) Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!
What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?
A robot butcher?
I know that, Kramer.
Oh, what are you doing here?
Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.
(thinking) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume...
Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.
Elaine?
Maybe it's in the lost and found.
Ill give you 50 cents.
What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to Kramers door) Ah hah.
Really?
Still got water in your ear?
No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car.
Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.
Kinda cool lookin'..
You also shouldn't use a donut.
Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.
'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?
Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a men's room. That's the end of that.
Hey.
No.
Eat something! Babu...
Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.
Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?
Why didn't he tell me?
At me?
Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?
You dont think... What? The pony remark?
What ever happened with the shirt?
Great. One of the best jobs I ever had.
Really? I thought you were rebuffed.
A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little decision.
Hey. How's the new place?!
(putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to Sopie's) Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship.
Kramer, why do you have to (noticing Newman) Hello, Newman.
Oh, Kramer huh?
Why do I have to go on the tour?
yeah that should be real fun
If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON UP (Jerry puts his head down - he's not looking forward to Kenny Bania)
Kramer called you?
We're in the middle of a discussion here.
I'm not getting illegal cable!
Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, George Louis Costanza. Here I am about to go to the electric chair and my oldest friend is dating the governor
You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldnt expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.
Everybody's got them.
Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage.
"Transfer"?
How could you say that?
You should always carry a pad and pen.
Adoring? What about handsome?
Oh, maybe he's got no hot water.
You know what that makes you?...A baldist.
Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?
Yeah. Me.
Really?
Sure, fine with me.
Without Elaine? What for?
(peering) That's an interesting package.
So ah, what did you do last night?
Well... we should...
You got me the air conditioner?
Family?
Where's his teeth! Where's his teeth!
What are you talking about? It's my car. Let me pay for the gas.
Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.
What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
That's nice.
(Stammering) Oh, I, I, think I remember..
I will.
Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.
He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.
(tearing himself away from Christie) Huh?
Tony, where are you?
Come on up.
Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?
Eh.
By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?
Couple of tough monkeys.
You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?
No. Thats out of the question.
Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car.
George is pickin' us up at the airport.
Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.
And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.
(touching the back of his neck) It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.
It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.
"AMCA?"
No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch)
Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.
(cont) and this whole justice league, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman. You mean to tell me Superman can't cover everything?
Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that?
No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.
Well-well we got to get the cinnamon.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
Hey!
Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.
Oh, thanks.
Uh huh. Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?
who?
But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?
(laughing) Really? What a shock.
I must have iron rich blood.
Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know, we can't go anywhere near there.
Yes. We did.
Ive been thinking about asking this girl Im, uh, seeing-
Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together.
Okay.
Boy.
I know.
Elaine?
Yeah, is this Sid Field's residence?
You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here. Mike Wichter. He sold plastic straws. You know the ones? You could bend them.
No Black Jack?
Yeah?
He repeated the name of the gift?
NO! Kramer!
I dont know.
You ready?
What are you all out of breath from?
Well, I didnt...
No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!
Hey, did you talk to the doctor?
Yeah, good idea.
I thought youre like Hitler in the bunker?
Hey, David.
So you saw Bania's act?
I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?!
I love crampbark.
Shut up, you old bag!
And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard!
(picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt off?
Hey.
This is no good. This is no good. Call her house.
Yes.
(unimpressed) So, what's this guy about?
(very disinterested) Hum... ok, what else you got?
Yeah, it's very good. (reluctantly)
You took your pants off?
What are you doing?
I don't know.
She doesn't open...?
Mmm-mmm. Too bad you're engaged.
Yeah, I'm soured.
Anything's *possible*...
Oh, well, now you're talking.
I don't know anything about that.
He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly . I would like to have a good show.
What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!
Hey.
Strike two!
W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?
Oh, oh.?
What happened?
Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man.
(Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.
Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough.
Why did she give you that?
" But I'm damaged goods now."
What is that?
I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
Oh, man, look at this mess! You know what's gonna happen if they see this?
Well, what does he do?
You're not gonna have any?
Well, maybe I'll just take it back.
I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
Is that what the doctor said?
How am I gonna fill two hours?
Can I take a guess?
Come on, Elaine!
Went out with George, you?
I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? "Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!"
(in a tuxedo) So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a woman that won't have sex with you.
Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?
So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial?
Well, maybe we should.
See you later. (to Elaine) Well we cant all be dating podiatrists. (Elaine laughs)
Ah come on.
Oh, you have a daughter?
There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing.
I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?
A uh, a person that uh...
Really.
Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?
(to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello.
You were saying Stan? I-I'm sorry about that.
I gotta get to the airport.
Yeah, but?
The Saab factory?
Take the keys.
Yes I know, I know.
Saving movies.
It's all right, she was cheating anyway.
Well I do.
The boom box incident?
Oh, see that's not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people.
Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that.
Why?
Were taking Elaine to dinner. Shes got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?
Good.
Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.
Maybe he knows O'Brien?
That's the way it works.
(to himself) My foot's asleep again!
No, no thank you.
Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination? You couldn't possibly visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life size snotty puppet. I guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. That's the end of the line for a mannequin. "What ever happened to Bob?" "Have you seen that new Volvo commercial? He's got a bulls eye right in his face." Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, I guess these are the two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves. Well dressed or getting killed. I'm sure there is some pro-mannequin organization that doesn't even like you to use the term mannequin. "Hey they're not mannequins, they're the life deprived."
I bought it for you. It's yours.
Me, why?
Why?
all right. One second.
The Dentist?
There isn't?
Then he asked you out?
It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
Well, I guess I have no choice.
You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there.
Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.
No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?
She is?
He did?
Meryl Streep?
Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom.
Well, its a first visit.
You. I'm talking about people.
(TO GEORGE, REWOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?
Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.
No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.
Faux pas.
Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.
See, again, I really don't feel that...
Who?
Then well just sit there.
Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.
Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.
(seeing that Kramer has a new watch) What's that?
Ooo, could be from that blonde
You really seemed to enjoy it.
So I really had a good time.
Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole!
Oh, no!
Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.
(thinking) I cant believe it. I got nothing! I dont even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...
Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.
Do you want me to break up with you?
And there's so much more to go.
Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.
(Confused) What's your position?
I thought you were going out with Celia?
How long is this gonna go on?
So what? A lot of older men have that.
No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking.
Oh the baby's fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt.
When did they ever spend any money?
Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.
Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. (Rachel shocked)
Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...
(Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.
Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.
It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!
You've got to have a story.
Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.
I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?
(To himself) I don't believe this! (Walks over to a security guard) Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with shoplifting..
I don't know what this is.
Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.
They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor.
Yeah. I really like her.
Get off the phone!
I guess you can take anything, but actual work.
Just go back and ask him again. (Slams the door on Kramer)
(sits on the back of the couch) Oh my god.
At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.
Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.
Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count on me! (hangs up)
How's it doing?
The engine's made by McDonnell-Douglas.
Awright.
To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.
But I don't want to.
He got fired the next day.
(Confused) I don't know what that means.
How's it going?
I'm heading over to Elaine's.
(impatiently cutting in) Hey Elaine What about the crest.? What d'you think of the crest here.
Yeah.
Oh, what do you think? I found it at the back of my closet.
(turning to Elaine; thinking) Oh no, not now.
Yeah.
You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.
Bye!
Yeah Why?
Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.
(not) Oh. Too Bad.
Wow! Zanadu . No wonder youre putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) May I?
You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.
So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouth-to-mouth.
No.
Why?
yeah
I don't know. (takes off his sweater) This sweater really itches me. You want it?
New clothes?
Great, I love Newman! (Eagerly following Kramer)
Well, take it easy.
Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?
What? Nothing.
You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding.
Because I know who has it.
We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)
Get together?
"What the hell's going on over there?"
I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
What? It's a victimless crime.
Do you think that's a bad sign?
Sit down, Elaine.
Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.
He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal.
I couldnt tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that
It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?
You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.
Oh no, it's Kenny Bania.
How about 'Mickey'?
Theres the giant ball of oil. Clares right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
(Takes the bottle from him) Just swallow 'em.
I know, I know.
Wha--you have a low sperm count?
Am not.
Yeah.
I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.
Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!
Hello Newman.
You too.
Yeah, I think it is. (They walk toward the man. Jerry hesitates.) Wheres Elaine?
(astonished) Oh god! What happened to you?!
This was your idea!
Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.
Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.
Well, maybe he's --
Boy... I dont know.
I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway.
I don't know, opera, it?s not my kind of thing.
Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.
Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here...
Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary.
"Yeah!!! What is that? I mean isn't that sick. I mean , I'd be embarrassed to have that in my apartment."
Then what'd you come down here for?
Pennypacker.
Yeah. What does that mean?
[with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?!
What's all this stuff?
I never heard her say hi.
What else did you say to her?
Whattya mean?
O.K. from now on I want you to call me "Jerry the Great".
Yeah, I know about the three dates.
Oh! Rimsky -- great great book if I may say so sir. I almost read the whole thing.
I, I had no idea.
I don't know
Can you grab a nap at work.
Sure. (points at booth) How about this one?
They're ladies' glasses! You know all you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.
Hey.
Oh, right.
Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.
(Waving good bye) We'll see ya.
I would lose that.
You can eat it?
Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?
(pause) All right; let's move it out.
I bought you a Cadillac. (hands over the keys) Here you go.
Yeah, I guess so.
Oh, beautiful did he like them?
Oh, you already gave them away?
(after Bookman exits) That is one tough monkey! (turns to Elaine) So you were saying?
I've been defaced!
No Jon Voight Day, huh?
Newman, too?
Yeah.
You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.
Well, what is it?
Just imports, no exports?
What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers.
Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned it...
No. I can't say as I have.
Yes this is the terrorist bomber.
Boy, It's the way they just slip it in there too.
So it's all over?
Oh, why not?
"Aw right."
Give me the clothes.
(STARTS TO LEAVE, TO HIMSELF) ...Kramer
Hello, Poppie. This is Elaine.
Nah.
There. Alright?
Not bad!
I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.
Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.
Why not?
All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? (sits opposite George)
Yeah!
That's what I do with him [points at George]
It's Kramer.
But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment shes going right for that machine.
So, can you believe that message? Now I?ve got to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
(pulling out a tape from his pocket) Vvvvup. Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your feet up?
Nine sixty.
Hi.
And here's the beauty--
It was embarrassing to me.
No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.
STAIRS??? There's no elevator?
Hey, it's one thing if I asked you "Could you do me a favor?" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE (Obviously up to something. Jerry doesn't suspect anything - yet) Whey you told me what you went through on the plane, it makes you stop and think. You appreciate having a real friend.
Yeah! me too
Yeah.
George?
Well, You can't go in there it's like a gas chamber in there.
Hi Willie.
Hey
Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.
Hello.
Oh, no.
See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup...
Listen, uh I just remembered... Im... uh, getting a facial.
Yeah.
No, hes making a bouillabaisse.
Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!
That's enough. (They leave. George comes around the corner.)
A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?
Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.
How late are the stores open? Im thinking of maybe uh, buying a new TV and smash it over my head.
No they're not, they used to be.
Yo?
Hello, oh hi Duncan, 400 o'clock tomorrow? That is not going to work. . . . Why? I'll tell you why. Because I chose not to run!
Well.
Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.
This guy's belching out vitamins..
(Complaining) No! That's the wrong doll!
Alright, how much does he owe you?
Thank you very much, that's great- >click< Oh! Hold on a sec, I got a call on the other line. >click click< Hello?
So, he's a writer.
Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.
Even more reasonable.
(Giddy) This is gonna be great!
Hmm. So you feel "women and children first," in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.
(dry) I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw? (really disappointed) Let's get out of here George.
So you ask her out.
But wait a minute...
What floss? When?
Okay.
Yeah.
Are you serious?
Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?
It's moronic.
Excuse me, Mother?
I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.
Ya how was it?
What happened here, Kramer?
(taking the jacket) Thank you.
There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair, striped shirt?
For fun.
All right, that's not bad. Now get over here!
I'm NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT! ..
(taking off his jacket) Slaughtered. Wiped the floor with 'em and (hanging up jacket) not only that, the money was unbelievable.
So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?
Really, I'm sorry. Maybe another time.
No. I don't.
I thought you'd like that.
Is someone there?
All right.
Course you may not see it for twenty years.
How can you lose?
Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.
Who?
Don't mention it to anybody.
Ah, the sweet stench of failure.
A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.
C'mon up.
So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?
You can't play Kramer.
Yes
Where are your clothes?
Yes.
(doubtful) Yeah, you'll make it up to me.
Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.
Oh, the guy from Jersey?
How about this I manage a circus..
Ah, that's a shame.
(smiling) Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.
Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. He's a punk, a patsy, a hack.
Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.
No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.
Who said you have to like it?
(setting down a box) No thanks.
I didn't know any of this.
(continuing to pack) That's a nice four seconds.
Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?
What is all this?
(flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb.
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.
What happened?
trust me.. nah it's good
Thanks. It's Hounds-Tooth.
Well I...
Why not you?
Always popular.
Cause I hit a whopper last week!
Ah, yeah.. I know.
I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the "It's me" on the phone today.
Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.
(agreeing) well three years is a long time to be married.
You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."
That's not going to be good for anybody.
Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.
It means he's lying.
Would you excuse me a minute? Im gonna go to the bathroom. Ill be right back.
Yes. Hes a doctor. (Elaine starts to leave. ) Wait a second. (Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in Elaines purse.) (to George) What are you doing?
the usual
I wish I could, but, we're friends..
What about you?
Buh bye.
N-na I'm paying for the trip.
My car's in the shop.
No.
Yes I know that.
Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.
Well, after he bit my friend--
God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?
They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?
I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back.
Ya that was some list.
Not a very long trip. (Enter Kramer)
Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.
So you were talking, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") you're having pleasant conversation, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") then all of sudden...
You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it?
(to the door) Yeah?
I need a miracle.
So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. Whats the matter?
Shes really hungry.
NBC!?! Give me the phone!
Oh, it's comin'. - Here ya' go.
I can't go.
When's he leaving? (putting some items into the refrigerator)
Hey, Ray.
(to Kramer) Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night. (frustrated) Where the hell is that jacket?
What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do whatever it is you do. You disgust me.
I know, and then you say to yourself, From this moment on, Im not gonna waste any more of it. But then you go, How? What can I do thats not wasting it?
Oh, you're "Pappy".
Yeah.
Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.
He went back? What do you mean he went back?
Yeah. You know, kind of a peace offering. Cute.
Okay. Thank you, very much.
Jane's topless. (They all look)
So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?
(dialing) He got em out of the house.
Opposite.
There isn't?
Sure.
I'll try and de-sour.
Yeah. Specifically 930 shows. Seen any good 930 shows at the Paragon, Willie?
Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist.
Elaine was... in a rush.
Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die.
Oh! I got a message. (presses button on answer machine)
Gee, I dunno what to tell you.
(Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) "Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone." (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out "Just go" while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. (Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her.
I was just in the bathroom.
Yeah, Ill see you.
My foot fell asleep.
Take care
No, you stay here in the car.
So, how's the fornicating gourmet?
Oh, Phil... Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry.
The apple pie you had today at Monks
I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!
I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.
Midnight Express, my friend.
Where?
I'll pick you up at your apartment. We'll go to the Eight.
The Coast,
Ah. I know the chef there.
Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.
I have money. I make money.
I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there.
I can't eat this.
As soon as is humanly possible.
You use a Water Pik?
You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?
(leaning out the window) Hey Georgie!
I know. It's like X-ray vision.
Oh.
Maybe I will.
What do you mean?
Elaine...
I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.
Come on up. (to parents) It's George.
"I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery."
Okay.
Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?
(Introducing the two) George, this is Nina.
What is he doing in the Chunnel?
So what?
(overhearing the other two Elaine, Elaine--
I want that number!
Svenjolly.
And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.
(Sarcasticly joking) It certainly has.
(getting out his wallet) Uh, one second.
Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me.
Because that's your thing!
If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?
I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.
...that's why men hunt and women nest.
Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding.
402? (Checks his wristwatch) Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup!
Hello.
Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.
Can we just go?
Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!
Will you let me pay just once.
So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.
I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.
Would she have hooks?
I suppose if it was on the protg's way to the mentor, they might.
This is going to be a shame.
No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman.
I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
The police?
Well, what about the ponytail?
Imagine, us narks?
Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, Im in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants.
Oh, there's no emergency...
No, hes It. He wins. It is good.
Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad it's Klompus.
You're 40 minutes late. What happened?
Yes you do.
How can I live there?
No.
No, no, no, it's... "She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her."
That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without the cushy timeslot.
No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.
You do the tub?
Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck.
What for?
Who goes to South America?
(surprised) He said that?
(To Assistant) I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?
The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go "Excuse me, I think you missed a spot."
What, are you serious...why, why did she call?
Commando 8?
(to Elaine) Where have you been?!
Oh, that's gotta hurt.
So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.
(Exasperated) Oh, God
I need a can of balls.
I'm not letting you cheat, Newman. You're not getting anywhere near that board.
Yes, all right, Katie.
He say anything?
Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?
Dont do the apples. Its enough already with the apples.
I think that would be a very nice gesture.
He gave you the nice face discount.
No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.
There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that...
Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.
To our future wives....yeah...
Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer.
Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't do you favors after you dump them.
Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.
It is a tad askew.
Kramer?!
Nothing.
All right, make it the large sodas.
(walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!
That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant.
What are you doing?!
What arrangement?
You raise the feet, get blood to the head.
Thank you. Hi Cynthia.
(looks in the creamer) Theres no milk in here, what...
Hey, what happened to my jacket?
Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.
You told her?
I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?
All right, now you call it in the air.
(Out of it) Huh?
Fine. Well.
Please, Donna...
Hello, Willie.
Yeah. What's wrong, why? ( George runs back to the bathroom)
George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!
(pause as he realizes) Oh, no.
I can?
Yeah, that'd be something.
Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.
Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.
So?
I don't know, but you better keep it up.
Although what if its one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?
Krame? Sein. What are you doing? Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island. What are your thoughts about taking a ride? You sure? Okay, but don't leave me hanging here. Okay, great. Let me give you directions.
Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.
Yeah, I guess you could.
What about Elaine?
What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.
Everything.
Neither do I. (to intercom) Yeah?
We're with him, we're with him.
Huh, wa?
What did you say?
The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!
Yeah. So you really like this guy.
How do you know?
We dont understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you cant stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I dont see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, lets make up our mind where we think theyre going.
What if I can't keep up?
The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be?
And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.
(to the phone) Hello yeah yes it is really ah, ah Could you hold on a second? (to George and Kramer) Hey listen to this, some woman found an electronic organizer, my name was in it, she wants me to help her track down the owner.
Yeah!
Yes.
All right, forget it, its over, Im not moving.
That's it?
Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine.
He couldn't handle the weight.
Oooh! I got a pain in my side.
Yeah!
All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---
All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.
Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place.
Well...
That's were they got it from!
Maybe that's why she's happy.
All right.
Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.
Oh, when did that happen?
(Butting in) Tina Turner?
Oh I see they have apple pie.
Odds.
You fell on her?
He yells and you don't get your soup.
You told me that already like two months ago.
Why can't I?
We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.
So?
You think?
Oven mitts?
What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?
No. We both just saw the same monkey.
Why?
Oh No, wait a second... Wait a second... I-I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name.
Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.
Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that. (stepping over Elaine then George's legs to get to the large blue chair and sits down.)
If they were fanatic about showers, they might.
Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.
Uh-huh...
You don't wanna tell me?
What's so special up here?
All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye. (Hangs up) Hey, I'm flyin' first class.
I love you, George. Come here.
So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?
(bitter) Not at the moment, Brett.
You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?
Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. (Elaine smiles and rolls her eyes at him) What brings you here?
I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.
Yeah.
It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it.
Hug is definitely good.
Dead man walking.
You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?
Yeah.
So youre sure youre not still angry about last night?
Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.
Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon?
What happened?
Sounded good.
Russia, it's so bleak.
I met her one time...
Sure, dinner would be fine.
Im getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other line beeps) Im getting another call, see ya(answers call) Hello!
Can you believe that?
Ok, great, well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu.
The whole block, forty, fifty cars.
My door?
Look at this
I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.
Oh, what about this one? Look at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for. (Sits on the couch.) Oh, yeah!
Oh like you do.
"Cut to the chase"?
Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity. 5? 3? Oh, it was just an expression. All right, well, that's very sweet of you. Okay, I'll call you later. All right, bye. Hey!
You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!
No.
Exactly.
Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.
Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be? (Elaine laughs - hu) Why can't you live?
No, but wait, wait And then you dump them off onto Kramer..
Why not?
Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.
Who makes copies?
So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.
What do you mean, oh boy?
I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.
(buzzes Elaine up) Come on up.
Well Hello..
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.
Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.
You got no waist in that thing.
Hey. How'd it go with Gary?
Quone? No, Im afraid that Im going to have to challenge that.
You and me.
I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping.
It's two roosters peckin' at each other!
(Pleading) George, would you help me, please?
What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these, like Superman? I've got to unlock this mystery.
Kramer!
I thought they wanted to settle.
Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!
Thousand.
On the couch? So you're...
Ohh!
The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.
Like what?
Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?
We went over that.
Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself.
Noit your type?
Right. I forgot about choir.
Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.
No, I don't know if I'm invited.
They're the worst.
Yeah, okay. (to Elaine) They may have found the car.
Why would I leave? This is my apartment.
Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice?
She's into it.
I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)
You look like you could use a...
All I did was shake your hand.
Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?
She's seen you in this thing.
What community? There's a community?
I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.
What's going on in there?
Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get in touch with you.
Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-
I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.
(to George) You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! It's crazy Joe Devola.
But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure.
Well, she could come.
I suppose.
Well, keep looking.
Can you move over at all?!
Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.
What the hell are you talking about?
Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.
That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is.
(confused) Wha..? What time is it?
Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?
What did you do?
Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)
Who you gonna to call?
(To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?
Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.
Yeah.
Okay, okay. Forget it. Its okay. I didnt mean it.
Hey, guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!
Too Gubernatorial. (?)
Well I think I get the gist of it.
Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!
You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But its really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesnt it? "I really am a doctor you know. You think Im not, just check it out." I dont know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. "Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and Ill give you my opinion." After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what theyre talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants.
Get in there. (he pushes George in the direction of the restaurant)
Yeah?
Kramer I don't think I can--
Oh, I know you are.
Hey Joe.
Go ahead.
It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.
I don't care.
What are you doing?
Great.
Oh
You're gonna have gorgeous kids.
He's George!
No.
Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.
No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing.
What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.
Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!
There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
Aw!
It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library
I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, its very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, Call the police. You really should call the police. So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, Yeah, Im calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... Im gonna see some real action. Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out The Report. They give you Your Copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I dont really think were gonna crack this case, do you? Its not like Batman, where theres three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up, hes dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him, hes a PENGUIN!
Alright.
Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.
I don't think it's that bad.
(startled) Kramer!
Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days!
No, road is a major detail!
And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's pretty sick.
And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?
Yeah.
Oh, big fighting marlin. (Jerry acts like he is catching a marlin)
Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.
Yeah... So's shock therapy.
Well, would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.)
All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.
So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?
Like with dogs.
So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head.
Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town.
That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.
We're acting. (they stop laughing)
That puddle! (Kramer sees the puddle and does a double-take.)
The woman, she--
You chuck.
Alright, alright, I'll cash the checks.
(nudging George) Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.
No openings in arson?
"...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!"
Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog strangler. (George leans close) would you suck a mint or something. Can I come right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where we are. Where are we?
Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on?
I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.
See?
You have them sleeping in drawers?!
Oh yeah, shes great.
Did he kiss you good night?
Go ahead.
(looking behind the counter) Hey, is that Babu? It is! (walking over) Hey, Babu!
Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.
(looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
He looks like a Peanuts character.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
Im sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
Uh-huh..
It was a *joke*...
Kramer. (knock, knock, knock) Kramer.
I'm sorry.
I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave.
It was a mix-up, I'm sure.
Oh its your cat!
So whatd you do?
Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?
Good for you
She looks so familiar.
What the hell...? Why is the door open?
Yes. I do love her. (to baby) You have a very nice place here.
Yeah , I was doing new material.
I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!
I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.
(Looking at his watch ) Yeah..
Hey. How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?
It's your Christmas present.
Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they want
The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.
Eh, what?
You gonna be alright here?
ca.
Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?
George too.
Couldn't be...
O-K. You realize of course, you're naked?
We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!
Ah, so, ah, flower shows and, shopping for pretty bows, and then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight?
He can't do that.
There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.
What are you talking about?
Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
(Over the phone) Elaine, youve got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin me on this car, which is yellow now!
And by then you've lost interest.
All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little.
Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
Hey, I love a good caper.
Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.
Sure.
Well, thats good.
Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?
(Kramer waddling out the door) Maybe you can soak in the tub.
Yeah (to buzzer)
Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.
Hey.
How you gonna get out of *that* one?
Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves, wanted to come home and start working on his floor.
Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?
Is that still from the cats?
I saw it.
We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it?
You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?
How do you know his name?
Nana's missing?
(stands, puzzled, it's not sinking in) W-what do you mean?
selling sexual pleasure over the phone?
What do you recommend?
(Interrupting Bania) Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.
We were right on the border.
What happened to you, pal?
Why are you bothering them for?
I thought you said you were a good driver!
It appears that way.
Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.
"We're"? What do you mean, "We're"?
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.
What are you so worried about this for?
Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting.
You know it and I ditched all my junk food.
Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.
Is there a captain's hat involved in this?
People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression 'The best revenge is living well' I've said this, in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice, doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him, 'Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting, french doors, a divan. That'll show those punks.'
Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.
What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?
What's wrong with your oven?
Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr.
Yeah, so?
Someone's cooking.
Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.
Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations.
Hi Doris.
Boy, I've never seen you like this.
Star Trek II.
You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
Wow.
You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.
Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?
They do have their own schools!
George what the hell are you doing over there? I told you to mind your own business now stay out of my affairs!
In the freezer.
Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.
So, ah, what are you doing around here Ramon?
That's alright, I got it.
youre a real pleasure. (Jerry is being sarcastic)
Could you stop the counting?
Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.
I'll pay for it.
I invented that.
Thank you very much.
All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a mnage  trois with her and her roommate.
Listen, Ma...
Eleven dollars for what?
If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened.
Hang on.
Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.
You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.
Oh, yeah, you mentioned her.
Boy, they seem pretty angry about something.
you know I'd like to hear about this job of yours
Hey...I'm not stupid. I'm looking in that drawer, there's no can opener.
I don't care.
...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to.
The old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go "how do you like crotch?" If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly.
We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked.
Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.
What do you do?
Hey!!!
But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.
Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad.
Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!
He took you to Rage-aholics? Why?
They're my socks!
Oh yeah.
Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.
Thanks, Lyle...
They got some sort of program.
I don't see why not.
All right, cmon. Lets go.
In a manner of speaking.
I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.
Yes, Mr. Beviacqua
(indistinct) Got all this?
(Joking around) Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.
Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.
(Scared) Ah! Kramer!
I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?
I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?
Okay, Okay, I promise. (puts on the headphones again) Wow!!! Oh Man...Oh God.. Oh Brother....Whoooaaaa!! Whoaaaa (Elaine enters he takes them off rapidly)
A stupid what?
Alright Kramer, enough of this. Let's go find George.
I- no, I dont want to go.
Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue.
No, no, would you get up?
It was stupid of me.
It doesn't?
(Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.
Look, youre a nice guy, its just that... we dont have anything in common.
I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example.
Did you see that?
He's a bubble boy.
What's the big rush?
I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. "Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life." Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, "I had a heart attack this big (Holds out hands, gesturing bigness) ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear! (Puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest) Brrhht.. and it's gone!"
I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.
I am a little freaked out!
Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)
So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box.
Not at all.
Elaine...
Can't you at least die with a little dignity?
What about NBC? Did you hear anything?
Really?
Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors.
So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more "grease monkey".
Aw, you know people.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!
Pam!
Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.
I thought they smelled pretty nice.
(holding up the '# DAD' shirt) We're even.
Hey, George.
Naturally.
But I don't wanna be a cowboy!
(on phone) Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago.
So, Saturday night.
(tapping the spatula while waiting for waffles to be done) Any second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready.
He's been sleeping a lot. He's still groggy.
What happened to you?
(coughing) I said, boy am I ugly.
I was. But, shes got me, like, hypnotized.
I'll see you later. (he leaves with unseemly haste)
Oh, yeah.
Nah. Ill just wear the pajamas.
Where?
How did you get fleas?
That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.
Yeah, that's true.
Anywhere in the city?
Boys, boys.
H... G... F. Seat four. One, two, three... f-- Hello Newman.
You're giving up that easy?
I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!
No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.
What are you doing?
All right. (goes into his hallway and comes back) You got my fins?
Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.
It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)
No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.
Oh! well whatever you have to do.
Okay, so how does it go?
Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
I'm working in Atlantic City.
By flying half way around the world?
What?
Yeah.
Remember, don't whistle on the elevator.
(quietly, yet in a high and whiney tone) Well, I don't know if I....
Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll uh try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. (Goes into his room, and comes back out with the jacket on.) Ahh, haven't worn this one in a long time.
Yeah, uh, Ok, uh, tomorrow uh, where da ya - where do you live, uh, up town? Upper west side?
All right.
You know, what you need is a song you can share.
Oh, like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping carts with one bad wheel?
So?
I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.
Im just gonna get my jacket, Ill meet you downstairs. Whats the matter, did you call?
Wait a minute! (A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.)
Oh.
Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.
You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...
I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?
Okay, fine. We'll use Newman.
Well, you know..
Don't spell.
Hey, George!
Why were you making gravel?
No problem.
All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll meet you in front of the theatre.
Open the package Leo.
That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?
Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?
Oh please, I love her.
Yeah.
(still outside) What was that?
(stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem?
No he's going downtown to guard the suit.
Well this is interesting.
Yeah, I cant eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I cant dance.
She flipped out! Just left.
What is that? (Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.)
So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy.
(cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You havent been out of the building in ten years!
I did not. You guys gonna go through some red lights?
Well, Ill tell you what. Ill choose you for it. Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...thats it, you gotta win three.
Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. You had to give him a box of cigars.
No, that's Krama.
What about, what about this thing?
(trying to defuse the situation) Look, no-one is lifting anything.
All right. Twenty-five hundred.
What'd she do?
George is already in there.
Dude!
Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing "no") A little taste! (still shaking) Come on. (still shaking)
Oh, a walk, well --
No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything off me, first laughs now ladies.
Oh, we finished early.
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!
Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?
Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--
Babu? Babu...[waves Babu to come to table] Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just, it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?
That close, huh?
Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.
But not anymore.
I don't know. What if I get caught?
Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?
What do you think?
Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.
It's a schnoz.
They were all like that!
I don't want to.
Hello
I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.
Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, No egg white omelets. Look at that.
You got a raise?
No, it's ok.
As we all do.
You got the picnic and burger traffic.
Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?
I had to.
"All right."
No, but he's not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR)
I'm saying "get the hell outta there"! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call, Jean-Paul! A wake-up call!
Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. (The door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
(examining the label) Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.
Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing?
I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high.
Never happened.
Ah, Im not wearing a watch.
Hmm, I really need to speak with him.
Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie.
(still bossy) Did you just order coffee?
All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you.
Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in.
She lives with her parents.
Hello, *Newman*...
Oh, well.
I'm buying you a new sofa.
Now here's another little rule.
How do you stop a kid from growing?
Get outta here.
I thought you'd like that.
They're uncomfortable.
(pause) You know, you're not Chinese...
We're pretty sure.
Let go!
Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of?
What could you possibly like about that?
Dirt? That's alright, (for Jenna's benefit) because there's nothing wrong with dirt.
Eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
Ah! What'd you find out, Lois?
I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.
Are you sensing anything right now?
Im worried I wont be able to talk to him. Hes such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.
There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.
Kramer, here!
I don't know.
It stinks.
Oh God.
Well I?m looking forward to meeting him.
(to Kramer) Hey.
I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.
Im just a regular person.
These beans are pretty good.
Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!
Is that a sectional?
Aw.
(trying to ease the tension) Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends.
What look?
(pointing out the obvious) George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him.
You didn't have to push me.
Well, who took the nap?
Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld.
Yeah. I hope so ?!
How's your family history?
He's a very special maniac.
What?
Well, when is that gonna be?
Uhh... no.
If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, Im telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. Im sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.
Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
Yeah, under the counter. What happened?
She reads lips.
Then we'll make it the eight.
Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.
No. Yes you can. (he hangs on)
Ah, mint.
Well, Rabbi, well.
Yeah! I got it . It's in the apartment, but we can't go in there it's being fumigated.
(belated) Good night.
Come on up. (Jerry presses the second button and opens the apartment door. He walks back to the couch.) Oh, all right, forget it, Im gonna take it with me now... (He picks up the cushions.) Im just gonna pack up the cushions right now...
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.
It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.
No,, but thank you.
yeah, it's a damn shame, a damn shame!
What?
(beginning to cough and struggle) Getting weak... Losing power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing without me. Nothing!
She had man-hands.
Are these seats unbelievable or what?
Why not?
Uh - new car!
Ho-ly!
No, No, No, No, Oh, No.
How could you not like the Drake?
If that's Rushdie, they're real.
...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.
I know, I know...
George, we're trying to have a civilization here.
This is real believable.
What if my life depended on it?
Good. How did you handle that?
Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?
Well it's not like spotting a toupee.
Oh no! >click click< Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!
Hey, check the TV.
So you don't care if I die.
So how did this all happen?
His lawyer.
Who's it from?
(to George) Hey.
Tony, y-you better bring that car back!
What're you doing with a pricing-gun?
Surprise!
Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.
Oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh that's terrific... Mulva.
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, that?s not fair, what about George, Susan and Elaine, what do you need me for?
I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!
(Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.
Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude.
Let me get a clean pair. (Goes into his room. George strides over to the window.)
Hey.
Yeah.
(Interested, still looking at the couple) Really?
(Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..
They're nuts with temperature.
Let's go.
...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the patient!
Hey
You can't take that chemist out.
Hey.
No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.
Kramer, cockfighting is illegal.
He can have a donut,
Oh, good.
I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy.
Ah, I'm jealous of everybody.
Oh. Yeah.
The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off?
I heard you say something, there.
Well...
I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.
555-3455.
Well, should we leave?
I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...
(placatory) Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me.
...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.
You're gonna take this kid to Paris?
Well, at least he didn't-
Whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guyll be like, I dont think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life? And of course the womans looking at the guy, thinking, What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?
Elaine, stop it.
Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.
How could you eat fish on a plane?
I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" thing.
Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.
Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.
You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do.
Oh, that's *fantastic*!
I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.
A friend of a friend of Susan's.
Kramer...
Hello?
What? She said that?
Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.
Right.
Really.
The, the meeting you blew off?
No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time?
No no, it was no joke.
August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress! She never changes! Oh my god. (looking around) She's gotta have hundreds of these dresses.
I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. Shes going to move in.
Wait 'til I tell him about the book.
It's kinda private.
Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.
We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.
Did I get a head start?
How did you know?
Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?
Well, that's very interesting.
I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
Get your finger out of my face.
A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the dish and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit.
Okay..
Really?
You weren't supposed to say that.
(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?
Yes, change. By all means, change.
well, you know, sometimes a square is everything
Dinner?
No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out.
(adamant) No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back.
Alright, I'm gonna get this. This looks good.
Whats the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!
Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
Let's not even analyze it.
What smell?
And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
Mr Mandelbaum, please.
Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.
Mulva?
No what?
I was trying to be.
All right, take it easy.
Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts, so he killed him.
A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.
Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.
Would you?
He's good, you're not.
Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.
Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred!
So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.
I saw one once that could do sign language.
Golden Boys always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry. Here... touch Golden Boy!
She says I suppress my emotions.
(to himself) Hmm, testy.
Oh, okay.
Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! (Kramer enters.)
Are you all right?
Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.
What'ya do with the one you took?
Yeah.
Yes, well that was nothing.
I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
Outside! I saw him outside!
Hard to imagine.
Thats perfect.
I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous!
All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom cab.
(Still staring at the woman) Uh-huh.
You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?
What are you two doin' here?
Bad situation.
And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.
Hey George, there she is again. ...
(Crying) What--what is this salty discharge?
What records?
C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!
No, I dont think so. Ive seen you two together. You make each other miserable. Its kismet.
Hi.
Aah! .. right. The ones from Oregon that are only ripe for two weeks a year..
Well, I-I-I told my wife not to bring it.
Oh, look! There's Gregory Peck's bicycle!
I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away)
Yeah, you in?
Already? That was fast... I assume he's not a High Talker...
Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. (George gives Elaine a look while Jerrys back is turned. Jerry turns around.) I saw that.
I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I cant stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion wont even exist. It wont. I think eventually well all be wearing the same thing. Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where theres people from the future or another planet, theyre all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided, This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and boots. Thats it. We should come up for an outfit for Earth. An Earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits. No speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, That was nice. I could wear that.
They're musicians. That's not a joke.
You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go... up.
Alright, I'll see you later.
Did you tell Peterman about this?
(Sarcastic) You better hurry.
Alright, I'll call him.
My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!
You better finish your little caf latte there. They won't let you in with it.
(to Kessler) Yeah. (to the phone) Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem.
Maybe I am.
The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.
(Shouting) Come on up! (Opens his door for Elaine)
We're going to Atlantic City.
I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide.
It's hardly been used.
What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)
There's really nothing wrong on the inside.
Why?
Hi.
No! [throws her purse back at her] No, I mean, no thank you, nah...
Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)
It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum.
Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.
Why'd you have to say anything to her?
Alright, that's enough. (sips coffee)
You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events.
What is this?
I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.
I don't have it!
I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.
(giving him a steak from the fridge) Here ya go.
I dunno, watch it on TV I guess. Why?
Did you hear what I said?
Nah.
You met J. Peterman?
This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!
Marisa Tomei?
You know, I really need to use the bathroom.
I'm on next, right?
Good meeting?
It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something.
Oh that's George. (presses the intercom button) Yeah?
What're you talkin' about?
Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.
No, I actually find you quite charming. A bit verbose at times...
wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to just sense it's in front of the couch?
It's killing me. (Makes a move)
I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!
Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!
Hey, why don't cha ask Susan?
Oh. Your ballet tickets.
I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
(Bitter) Good night, Newman.
Stop smelling your arm.
It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.
(in the hallway, hearing the door lock behind him, turns back) Kramer!
Still no luck
What do you mean you don't think so?
Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are?
Hi, I'm Jerry.
You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.
What are you doing?
You must have quite a time down there.
My cable hook-up? What about it?
What?
Why?
What?
50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.
Oh, well, that's at the cleaners.
All right, but you have to go now.
Gee, I'm really sorry.
No, I don't wanna see the naked people.
Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.
I cant believe this. So what are you saying? You didnt like my act, so thats it?
Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.
Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George.
Because you were too busy stealing a book.
All right.
All right.
Hi.
Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?
Hang on.
Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.
I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!
Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?
Shut up, you old bag!
(In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so.
Hey.
No.
Hotel?
THIS is your hiding place?! (Elaine laughs)
No, I don't.
Ah! There you are.(Kramer motions silence)
Why'd she get fired?
No, no.
Why?
She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.
Hey.
You know, long dark hair.
Hi.
So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?
And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?
Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.
(Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that line?
What d'you mean, could've?
What are you talking about?
Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. If you're there it'll be a better group.
Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?
Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.
I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.
No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.
Was it eaten?
You ready for the second one?
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
All right, here!
It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.
Nothing, what's doing with you?
You ripped off a Ziggy?
Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.
Everything.
Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity.
We're four months apart.
(Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key?
She does have a way.
What's that?
Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this, now she's got nothing.
And who is on the show? Who are the characters?
Yeah.
Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign.
Well, I think you're wrong.
(doing the voice) No-o-o-o.
I have no patience for lactose. And I wont stand for it. Um, Ill be right back.
No, I dont eat dinner. Dinners for suckers.
You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?
In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.
Ah ha...
You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?
You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!
I think we're still a man short.
You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?
So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?
Pam? What do you care? (Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying a Brentano's bookstore bag.)
Really very good looking.
No, no, no. Just hypothetically.
Hello?
I never shouldve gotten involved in this. Im a nervous wreck. Im not cut out for investing.
we're expected to be superficial
Oh, then I lost interest.
He went to get some steak sauce. Why?
Oh, great. Ok we'll goin' away. I think I'm excited.
Well, that's garbage.
So?
As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protg of my own.
I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone.
That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow. It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.
Ramon, what are you doing here? You could get in trouble.
I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...
What did you do about them?
Yeah, well that relationships really got a lot of potential.
That Arabian is strong coffee.
No, I can't do details.
I'll be here.
I think you're wrong.
Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them.
(not interested) Oh, I'm sure they are.
Dont you think she woulda heard I was there?
Oh, get out of here.
Seven.
People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
Not all of 'em!
Come on...
You did?
No, I told you, it's just a dry run.
Of course.
...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.
C'mon up. (To George) Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'
Hey.
I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?
Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.
What now?
No, no tricks.
What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?
..living together after a while we... we might start to get on each others nerves a little.
She's on your turf.
Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document.
(under his breath) George.
The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..
No! Stop it! Kramer, stop it!
It smells like the beach.
C'mon Elaine, it's just a goiter...
Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.
All right. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle Arbys no more than once a month. And in exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game, and doesnt read a book.
Girls. There's girls right here in the store. Look, look, there's one over there. Look, there's another one. Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there. What's the matter?
I got my health.
It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?
What do you need it for?
"Jimmy?
Where are you going?
Sleeping in the caragain?
[not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]
What for?
No. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
Really?
Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!
Ooh!
Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..
Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, is that you?
Oh my God!
(Disgusted. To the woman) Oh, come on. You know he's a postman, don't ya?
I, uh...well...
Sexual?
Jody the masseuse.
Well, I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble.
Since college.
It's not complicated.
I dont know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I cant decide.
Whatever you want me to tell them.
So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.
How much could you possibly have in there?
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?
Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another mistake.
That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.
But, you know, what if, you know?
(leaving too) Yeah. Yeah.
I'm sorry. I'm soured.
Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!
You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.
(outraged) He's a doctor!.I mean it's supposed to be like a sterile environment."
SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?
I dont need any more.
So he just shaves his head for no reason?
Hey, so where's my sneakers?
Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.
He told me a few months ago.
Yeah. It's in your closet.
Then it was trash.
Oh, ya' going?
All set. We'll just grab the bags.
Are you sure?
Oh, it's George.
Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?
Is that Joe Davola?
There must be some mistake.
Why? It's our place.
And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone.
Hello?
Fungicide. I mean what could she have?
We don't hear that. (They enter the elevator)
Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.
I mean, what's the deal with cancer?
Hey, T-bone!
Don't you see what's goin' on here???... No boxers, no Jockeys...
And milk.
I don't understand. What don't you like about it?
You could do that?
Mulva? (waves off George with his hand)
Bomb threat.
Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing and
Flinched? I did not flinch. George, did I flinch?
He was what?!
You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is! I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, someone asks me which way is Israel, I don't fly off the handle.
You know their timing couldn't be worse.
Ok
George, here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
Oh, great! Alright. (We hear the announcers calling the game.)
What'd ya tell him that for?
(tossing the ball) Here you go.
Well, it's something to consider.
My whole night's ruined. I didn't do any sets, didn't do any movies...
What do you got there?
I cant blame you. I cant believe she never called you back.
You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...
Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?
(To George) You're givin' him back that TV.
You have a girlfriend?
Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.
I don't know.
Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!
(yelling) Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.
Who figures and immigrants gonna have a pony?
Yeah.
George? (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.
What do you think?
Im a little nervous.
Aye......
Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.
What? (Kramer hands Jerry an envelope) My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it?
Oh that makes a lot of sense.
George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.
Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.
Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!
Nothin' What do you want?
George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman!
Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!
Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.
(long pause -- did he hear "ridicurous" -- should he say something -- can't decide if he should. Finally...) Did you say, "ridicurous"?
Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.
Yeah, thats good. Hed clunk our heads together like Moe.
You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-
She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.
Sure.
Yes I am.
(Takes the ticket back and looks at it, flips it over) The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too.
Yes, I pick it up.
Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!
Why can't I be bombable?
Oh, in a minute, Carol.
I can't ... I can't
(Threatening tone) So, listen, Puddy. When we first started this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you want to play hard ball, I got my friend, George, here, and he can play pretty hard ball. (Leaving the negotiation to George) George, vein it up.
Hey Elaine.
44th and 9th.
Are you sure he cant hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.
I'd rather not talk about it.
I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?
Im not here, leave a message.
O.K.
Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?
Yeah.
Got what?
I'll say.
hey hey (fooling around with his collar)
I'm not going to "defile" her!
Kramer, she was murdered!
Your spare set?
Im just saying..Alright.
Let us pray.
You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift.
(leaving hurriedly) Wuhh...
Yeah...
But I never walk you home.
You're robbing me.
What's that smell? What are you wearing?
Ah, that's a shame.
Hellooo Newman.
Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little longer)
Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!
Yeah.
Did you give her a reason?
Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something.
Yeah, that's why I said hi.
So, Puddy wear's a man fur?
Amy and Jeffrey?
Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents.
But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there, "Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin. Well I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on."
I didn,t tell you to park in that lot .. Now someone's gonna have to drive you every time you need your car.? Take the bus!
With that?
It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.
To wash my hands. Theyre sticky from the orange.
My foot fell asleep.
I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.
No, you'd have to be crazy.
All because of Wrath of Khan?
C'mon, you want to have a baby.
Good to have you back.
Did you see the look on that guy's face?
That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?
Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.
(animated) You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about.
You can't make it?
Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?
I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?
Yes, I do.
You look like something's on your mind.
Kramer wants to die with dignity.
What are you gonna do there?
Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.
(simultaneously) I hate you!
She wanted to thank us for the apartment.
(indicates with his thumb) Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.
You see?
Hello?
Hey, not bad. (pointing to crest) I kinda like this little thing here.
Lip area.
Look I don't know.
Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!
Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And Ill need that in the form of a question.
Maroon Golf.
Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.
(Like a little kid) But, I don't want to be a pirate!
So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these types of people.
I'll see you later.
But you gotta like their chances.
No, because that's...
Why?
He doesn't wanna take a ride.
What you do say about a guy like this, huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. But your loyalty is beyond question.
Talkin' to Sidra?
(continuing) The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.
What're we gonna do?
Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
I cant find the receipt.
That wasnt so bad, really.
Women aren't like us.
Uh! Really .That's nice.
Yes I was.
Why don't you put it in the *bank*?
Go! What could you do?
You mean stakeout the lobby?
Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.
Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses.
I cant. Shell get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.
Alright, I'll change my shoes. (Heads back to his apartment. George follows.)
Hey! So, wheres my money?
How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet!
Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much for so long.
Well, what's wrong with you?
Coach to India - The only way to go.
Alright, I'll feel him out.
What do you think the dry-cleaners is your own personal closet!
Does she hate cigarettes?
No.
Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down. It's a business.
Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second. Hello.
Gimme that rye!)
Of course, I always do.
You put her on a pedestal.
(NO!)
Yeah, isn't that something?
What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!
(Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..
The fly-boy.
And you want to be my latex salesman.
Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?
I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.
(urgent whisper) Elaine.
Okay, so what if it moved?
Look. Just, forget it, (already). All right?
You see the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around, but they don't know they're ugly, because nobody actually tells them.
Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that.
George got him fired. He squealed on him.
(noticing Alec Berg walk in, whispers) Hey, Alec!
Yes?
Sure. Why not? You're there.
Hey you know George isn't to happy, ahh, about your new friendship.
...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, "Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now." "This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration." You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration, (waves imaginary wallet) "Here's fifty-six people that know me." Cop goes. "Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check."
Witchy Woman?
I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
I don't know Kramer, ahh, my concern is that ....
Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police! Some guy just gave me a wise answer. Ask that woman.
Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup of Decaf. (leaves table)
(Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.
I got the call...!
. . . HE ended it?
(OC) Hey everybody! Who's ready to laugh?
Not with a cane?
If I like their race, how can that be racist?... Hellooo??... Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!... Yyy-yes, I am calling George... Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!
Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.
Down here?
Elaine...
But you said, it can be very serious.
Ah. Whered you go?
(Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?
Oh, really. (Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.)
Well, you seem happy.
No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.
Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact with --
(to Kramer) Could you stop that smacking?
(Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything?
Well, what happened? Was she there?
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
(Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?
I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
Your whole building smells like potatoes.
Ah, it's just a car.
It's Jerry.
What happened to your mental alarm?!
Oh, yeah.
You were very nice!
Oh. Sounds great.
Oh my!
Just in time for Amy.
Yeah, I'm free, why?
C'mon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine)
We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? (turns to George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George?
So what?
. Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it
How could I know she would start to laugh?
Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?
Uh, this is George. (reaches for her name) Im sorry...
Hey, I thought you went to the game.
Hes a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.
You can't put a paper towel on his head.
Is this the proper venue?
Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. (pretends to pull hair out)
I met her on an elevator.
More everything!
What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of temperament?
You're cut off, you're out of the loop!
What'd you say?
I accept.
Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.
You sure you don't want the tickets?
Ah, I'm one kind.
What?
I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you?
Wha - wha - what's the matter?
Did he say anything?
Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.
Either that, or theyve got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why dont you just go to the cashier?
No, I'll crab it.
No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. Whats important is you two getting back together. Eh, then well talk about the car.
Oh no. Thats impossible. Id rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.
Wow, look at you. So you got the job.
Oh man...
So very gorgeous.
Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it.
What?
of course you would
Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?
Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop, clip clop. They're nuts for it.
Well, I didnt uh really mean a pony, per se...
Not this movie.
That is disgusting.
(Scolding) George. (To salesman) Sorry, were just waiting for David Puddy.
Yeah, I washed it.
How could that be?
What are you talking about?
Oh yeah, I heard all about it.
Babu, you're Pakistani, right?
We don't know!
(waving the key) You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!
(disappointed) Oh, Hi, hi.
Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you.
Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... Im sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if...
You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe its Manage A Trois.
Okay, thank you. (hangs up the phone)
The virgin!
He's in Pakistan.
Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, "Photographs - Do not bend".
Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So...
Hot tub?
(bored) Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it.
He's from uh...Trinidad and Tobago, right?
(Gesturing to Ellen) Kramer, George, this is Ellen.
Na, uh, no, uh, I'll hitch hike.
(taking the envelope) Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em.
(realizing something) Oh, my god!
Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go?
I cant believe it! This guy ripped me off!
Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.
You gonna do a little yelling?
What is that?
alright I changed my mind, uh yeah I don't think I'm not gonna go now
No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?
And they said they can do it?
I can't, I can't take it.
So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.
How does that reflect me?
I'm going for the record.
Mugged?
Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm alarge.
Duck, Kramer! Duck!
No.
How much do they cost?
All right, I'm, i,m takin' the camera.
Yeah.
(To Assistant) Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.
Well, Guatamala...
Well I thought we'd both be getting married.
Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll watch 'em go slice this fat bastard up. (sips coffee)
Stop being so concerned with looks.
This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.
What do you think the Nazis were doin? (Imitates the Nazis salute) That was the heil-five.
So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City. I'm performing at Bally's.
I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice)
(sarcastically) No you don't..
How could I have fleas?
Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?
Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there?
huh huh
Ah, where you gonna meet a mute?
Catnap?
She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.
Can you believe I did that?
Who?
Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee)
Wavy.
So you called.
What are you doing? Were going out to dinner in ten minutes.
Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone)
She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply)
Today, right now! Are you in?
The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper!
Holy cow! Have a nice life.
See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey George, look, I'm not funny now.
Come on. Let's go.
So what good are you?
(surveying the restaurant) Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it!
Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker.
So what happened? You gave her my tax papers? ... My papers?
Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner.
I got isobutane-20.
Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him )
ya
I know! What are you doin' here?!?
No, go ahead. Look at this place. I cant wait to get it cleaned.
Whats the difference?
Ah, how about 830?
Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...
Tractor!
What is it?
Well, go in there and talk to her. She's not going to put em on the glass.
...Yeah I am, but I just...(man hangs-up)
Your boyfriend, he's taking it out.
What if she's having an off night?
Carl, I think.
Coincidence? This guys in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment?
(sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand.
Sounds familiar.
Okay.
Crazy Joe Divola
Hey.
Really?
No, I don't want that smell in the house.
Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?
(Pleading) George, I'm sorry.
Just me?
30 years.
It's funny!
Yeahhh, am I imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and holds it up to Willie) Found this little cutie in the pocket. (throws the stub on the counter)
Excuse me.( gets up and opens the door)
Oh hi, Katie.
I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.
Ow. Stupid fold-out! Why'd they put the bar in the middle of the bed?
Alright.
Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.
What's the matter?
Nah. You two go.
Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks.
That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.
Walked right over to her table.
Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?
Do you see him?
Yea yea ya I shoulda kept it.
It's like this all the time.
I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.
I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.
(turns to greet Kramer) Hey.
Hey, wait a second. You know, we could share a cab. They're playing at the same Cineplex.
I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
So, what are you up for? How about Mexican?
What's his name?
How was it? What'd you talk about?
Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.
(with a triumphant point) You're busted!
Alright, he just left. We can go.
Ahh, I'm, I'm kinda soured.
Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up)
I think I may have made a big mistake.
What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods.) Did he tell you whats gonna happen? (George shakes his head.) How long were you there?
Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.
Who goes *anywhere* with Newman?!
Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews.
Its uh okay.
Come on! GEORGE is getting married!
How long do they usually last?
Just me? No dudes or fellas?
Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.
Swivel?
It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.
Expecting Newman? That's funny because I just happened upon him down at the Kenny Roger's Roasters.
Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
(Trying to get rid of her) Yes, I think it's a fine idea. Well, good night.
(weakly) A little better. (fake cough)
What bet?
Beside that. Look at the waitresses.
Bridget!
So your saying UNICEF is a scam?
I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
Elaine?!
Huh?
For the apartment.
Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. I'm being audited.
(hitting metal with the first strike of the shovel) Well, that was easy.
He's gone, George.
Uh, how about a couple of people like us.
(taking them) Well, what's this for?
Could you move your car back a little?
Suing? What for?
Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh...
Hey.
Yeah, whats it like?
Yeah, thanks.
He's a ringer!
Hey, Kramer, look at this.
So?
So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?
Well, if I hear an anguished "oink", I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look (HE POINTS AT PASSERBY) Human, human, human... (HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR, WITH ALARM.) (WITH MOCK ALARM) Wait a second! (Grabs Kramer)
He's wailing on that banjo.
Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day.
So what your genitals are still lined up.
Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.
Don't say that.
I have no idea.
A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in The Blob.
Go again?
St. Elizabeth's Hospital? Why?
Six weeks?
Oh, well, I didnt actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into him there. (putting on coat)
Well, we fight a lot for some reason.
OK, see you later.
Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!
Jodi.
I told you, forget it.
Oh, great. That's great. What a night.
Just forget it. Let it go.
I'm not paying for anything until I get that back.
Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this?
Here you go. (Poppie stands up and takes the money.) Anyway, I'm sorry again about the...(notices a large, wet stain on his couch)...the...the...
Boy, do you smell something?
George?
Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 1130.
Seven and five eighths
Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?
Okay. Thanks.
Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.
I told ya. How good is this?
Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.)
Alright, c'mon up.
No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald cure.
Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.
(Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.
Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!
What's with the fake sneezing?
How much money is this gonna cost me?
Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?
No. No, no way, no Bania.
Thats not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table repeatedly.) You know, maybe its not that bad an idea.
(to Morty) What about you?
Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.
(quickly) No.
I just met her, she's incredible.
Will everybody please leave?!
The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.
Wizards!
(Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.
Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.
You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool.
Shell call you back. Youre overreacting.
Great.
I dont believe this.
Tell me about it.
What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't respect salad eaters.
They're doing an incredible business.
Yeah, I'll just pay for this.
Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?
Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat)
(Carrying her out, piggy-back style) No, what?
I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.
You don't wanna get married?
Yeah, but--
We're dead.
(calls) Hey you two. Im ready to go.
Pulp couldn't make it across the table.
Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me.
I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?
You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.
Well we
Hey look , Champagne..
All right we're coming down.
All of a sudden it hit me, I realized what the problem is; I can't be with someone like me.. I hate myself!! If anything I need to get the exact opposite of me....It's too much. It's too Much I can't take it ...I can't take it!!!
Is that from my gift certificate?
Extra teeth. I love that look.
Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full.
In the back, on your right.
Scarf?
I'm sure it didn't move.
I mean I have many gay friends...
Are you sure?
You're lucky they let you drive a car.
My moms down in Florida. Shes got uh one of those condos. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?
Yes, it is.
Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.
How are these your socks?!
No, no, no. I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.
Well, I'm gonna do something about this.
Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???
Hi, Lisi.
So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the Spokes model category?
No she didn't.
I don't get this. How did this happen. I don't have a dog.
Help yourself.
(bewildered) Why would she try and kill you?
Ar-moire.
A little
Hi.
No, it's too trendy, no Isabella's.
Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally!
No, they won't call the police.
Okay. Great. Thanks.
Why don't you try your engagement story?
Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight. In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.
Hey, I was dying over there.
No, I don't.
Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.
Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.
Tell me about it!
Yeah. (subdued) I don't think this is the jacket.
...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.
All right, I'm worming.
Thanks.
(handing her a magazine) Here, read this.
Yeah.
But someone is waiting for me!
(coming out from the bathroom) who was it?
Yeah.
Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.
Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.
Isn't it Myanmar now?
Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... what kind of a sicko would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide (small fingers opening imaginary drawers) Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT hard to get round black buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this? ... is it such a great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, you'll never find them - they save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they're going to fall off too that's the other thing ...
Just like that?
Kramer, you can't talk to Frank.
No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's.
By yourself?
Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on.
(to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.
Discount?
Yeah.
Oh...
Thats got nothin to do with it.
Stacey.
Hey, isn't that Michael's car?
Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?
(thinking) Yeah, thats normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?
You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?
(sarcastic) Yeah, you told me.
What is so funny?
(to himself) This is a new one.
You're going to make a good father someday.
(Pleading) I tried my best!
(pressing intercom) yeah?
You may have a point.
I dunno , I'm gonna ask Shelley ,but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident.
What did I do?
You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about the Costanzas'
What for?
What?
How was the movie?
I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table.
Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago.
(Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!
Nothing.
No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.
You get in the bubble with him?
A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!
So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right?
Is it padded?
You know, I think he wears a piece.
Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.
I'm not lying.
Aw, that's kind of sweet.
The" coup d-toe"
Didn't go for it, huh?
How's it look?
Pinkish hue?
There's a giant parrot in the hallway.
Oh, shes really great. I mean, shes got like a real warmth about her and shes really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better.
"Can't believe your going out with him..."
Youre an architect?
Oh, Hey, there's a name you don't forget.
The what??
George, I've been sick all week. Elaine was too. Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes. Do the math. Yeah, maybe I will get out. Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first. Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something. Yeah, Selwyn's. Okay bye.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.
He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.
Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!
"Not necessarily because....."
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.
What's up?
(Cutting him off) Thank you very much.
It's inhumane!
See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.
Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?
So know every time you get dressed. You are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer.
I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.
You satisfied? So you see?
I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.
I DON'T WANT IT ....
Okay, Tim. You're welcome. (Hangs up.)
Oh, no. I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with it.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.
Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just "recede into the night," if you know what I mean.
(yelling) Yes I told him the Packyderm story!
The timeless art of seduction.
(Reads the pill bottle) What kind of pills are these, anyways?! "For Smuckers"? "May cause panting and loss of fur"? (Turns to Kramer) These are dog pills!
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!
Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
You know what? I'll be with you in a minute.
Cmon, move up.
(taking the envelope) Wh..What's this?
Sorry, really.
Hey.
The...black, leather...thing with a strap.
Shut up, George.
Well, Poppie's a little sloppy.
oh uh nothing, she just.. choked on a jujube
Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!
No.
Wait a second. *My* move?
Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.
All right?
No.. you?
Oh! you just startin' now?
Does it ever bother you that this organization-
If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.
Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.
Again?
(walking away) Well, I didn't sleep with her.
Alright.. (Heads for the door, grabbing his coat)
Oh, she is, she absolutely is.
Why?
...the...the...
Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
Hey, it's okay.
I dont get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?
What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.
Take it to the window.
So Whatley sayd to me, "Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic."
What were you doing?
Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
Im just so glad its back.
What?!
Wow! Good work, Nancy Drew
I dont give out bites. I got another one. But Im saving it for later.
Oh! Oh! *Delores*!
All right, so youre chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead.
He couldn't believe it.
Wait a minute, that's my ticket! You didn't even want to go.
So the whole set was destroyed?
I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something!
Not that I would think of doing such things.
So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?
(pointing to Kramer's hair) You got some suds over here.
Oh, go ahead.
I think we might have one left in the stock room.
So it's a nice place to work?
They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.
Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it.
It's the new J. Peterman catalog. Look.
What, Elaine?
All the time. Ive been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I cant live like this. I dont know what Im gonna do. Im heading for breakdown! (to Harold) Cant you do something?
Well, it has nothing to do with you.
She did?
I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.
She does not.
Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?
You can tell me, I'll vault it.
(sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there and I will.
Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?
Thanks.
All right, that's enough of that. (Jerry takes the plates and hands them to a waitress.)
You liked, Newman?
You're a shmoopy!
(to baby) Hello. How are you/
No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.
"The guy?"
Ya what was this? (HE IMITATES MOHEL'S FLINCHING)
No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.
Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!
Well, she obviously liked you all along.
We'll see you later.
Hi Pam.
Kramer, what the hell did you do?
Like what?
So?
Hey, Frankie! So, where's the car?
Yes, I do. (very serious)
That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no--
I guess that's all right.
Conjugal visit?
And what is that?
Didn't you call in sick yesterday?
It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.
Hold it, hold it...Look your gonna need the jaws of life to get out of those things.
But it was in the cylinder!
Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer, say it isn't so.
Speak of the devil.
Boy, the resemblance is uncanny.
Here comes one.
All right. Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot. (hangs up)(to George) Casting tomorrow at NBC. 400. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful. (George looks disappointed)
Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.
No, absolutely nothing. (They get up to leave) You're fantastic! (They meet up with Kramer and George on the way out) Hey guys!
I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.
Hey what are you doing Friday night?
And you waved it away.
No, no the junior.
What's wrong with yours?
We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?
Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome.
What?
I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.
Did I?
No ,it's George ( Elaine laughs heartily)
Yeah, but how could you be so sure?
It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?
Well that was really fun, thanks.
Everyday.
We should get him something.
Just like that.
Pretty good.
What is the point of all this?
Seems reasonable.
Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I?
Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.
Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?
Parsippany, New Jersey.
Oh, no thanks.
Use it in a sentence.
"Why. You took a shower?"
Farfel?
Anyway, I'm ready to go.
No. No Suze.
I try.
Isn't that some kind of safety thing?
Well, I do.
Hi. Hi. Look, I don't know what you think --
Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.
I was an idiot for listening to you!
That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.
Kramer, what are you doing here?
How long did that last?
(grudging) Alright.
Bonkers?
I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..
So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.
Let me see those. ( smells them) Oh! I know the chunky that left these Chunkies......NEWMAN!!! I've got him.
Let's just make a run for it.
No, not yet.
So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?
And I don't want you to hold mine!
You can barely see her face.
Why?
You can do that.
Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?
Yeah?
Wow, Newman's helmet.
Fine. Go.
Whenever I see the news and they're hauling in some kind of terrorist, psycho, maniac, mass murderer guy. You notice he's always covering up his face with the newspaper, with the jacket, with the hat. What is he worried about? I mean what is this man's reputation? That he has to worry about this kind of exposure damaging his good name? I mean, what is he up for a big job promotion down at the office or something? Afraid the boss is gonna catch this on TV and go "isn't that Johnson from sales? He's up in that clock tower picking people off one by one. I don't know if that's that kind of man we want heading up that new branch office. He should be in bill collection. I think he's got aptitude."
Hurry up George! Step on it!
You know who that is? That's
Hello.
No no. I'm just saying.
What for?
That was Elaine , she changed her mind. She's not coming over.
Wow.
You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this jockey and the jockey got off the horse and started chasin' him.
What'd ya do?
Look at you, youre still thinking about it. Ill never feel comfortable.
Ok, let's towel it up.
George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
What do you mean they're not going to do anything, they're the cops, they gotta do something, he just put the kibosh on me, do you know what the kibosh means, its a kibosh!
Oh. thank you.
She's not Lincoln.
"Rust-proofing"?
"Jerry"!
The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.
You ever find anything?
Yeah. Kramer made it.
(Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?
You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars.
It's kind of cozy.
I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?
I like it.
Yeah!
Uh, Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld.
Hair?
(quietly) Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
I don't know. I just feel he should call me.
Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.
Did she mention anything about our lunch?
Yeah!
Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up?
I don't wanna be Switzerland.
Elaine?
Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)
Wow, a communist. That's something.
George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, ok...do we know where the 101 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 170 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 134 is? (George just looks at Jerry) No. Aha, ok. (Jerry hangs up) He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up.
Fabulous. See, now you're really do something.
I wasn't thinking! I don't know.
You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.
It's been three days already, forget about Lupe.
No. Come on up.
Where?
Hey, I called you last night, where were you?
Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.
Eh, eh, ah. Winona's gonna be there?
All right, what are you gonna say to him?
I'm ready to talk.
Yeah. Highest paying job I ever had.
What do you think the worst part of being blind is?
No I didn't.
I mean, you love Susan, right?
(to Kramer) Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot.
Let me just get my jacket.
Well there's always a place for you, on our team.
Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.
George?
What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?
What are they for?
Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) "Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."
I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.
Bye.
Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.
Look, its a very awkward situation. I dont wanna be presumptuous.
What?
Hey, there's a booth.
Oh, he sang like a canary.
You promise you'll never come in here again?
(neutral) Fine.
That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and-
What else did you two do?
No big surprises.
And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.
Well, I want to sit down.
Ah, Le'me see. (hands Jerry the playbill)
What happened?
I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.
What's up?
The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. Cause it says Waiting Room. Theres no chance of not waiting. Cause they call it the waiting room, theyre gonna use it. Theyve got it. Its all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and youve got your little magazine. You pretend youre reading it, but youre really looking at the other people. You know, youre thinking about about them. Things like, I wonder what hes got. As soon as she goes, Im getting her magazine. And then, they finally call you and its a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. Well, I guess Ive been chosen. Ill see you all later. You know, so you think youre going to see the doctor, but youre not, are you? No. Youre going into the next waiting room  the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You dont wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You dont want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in? Do they scalp tickets to these things? I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two...
Oh... You mean... shrinkage.
hey, uh.. (Kramer walks around a little) what'd you get there?
Trouble
Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.
Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I cant ask her.
Yea especially Ziti, with that big hole.
She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.
Do I have to?
Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?
Love that babka.
Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.
They know how to make 'em...
Alright, will you pay for the cleaning?
Mmmm.
That's the last babka. They got the last babka.
Hey! Hey Mick.
I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.
Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea.
We'll be fine, what did she say?
I cant believe Im gonna do this. (Jerry opens the door and exits the dressing room. He walks over to Bania)
What happened to the car?
They're only comfortable with *their* equipment.
Do you wanna flip a coin?
Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?
Hey, Tim.
That's your move?
(smiling) I don't think so.
No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.
I'll take fastidious.
No.
Oh, you hung up on my Nana?!
Yeah. Proctologist.
Aren't you cold? Where's your jacket?
Really?
Where are they already?
Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?
Real busy now down at the office?
She hasn't told her father yet?
(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
Yeah.
We're going to the Knick game!
So this is it, huh?
Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?
He did it.
Oh, he's having a heart attack.
So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.
(buzzes her up) Eh. (to Kramer) You know and I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying "my wife." Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - "my wife" this, "my wife" that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence.
'...downtown.'
So what'd we get?
Doesnt matter. Whats the young mans name? I would like to meet him.
Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball?
No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.
No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
Look who's here! Georgie-boy!
Why here?
Try Elaine.
I love the Drake!
Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket?
You know you're getting gypped over here.
So what was wrong with him?
Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.
Oh no.
Yeah? Would you do it?
Well turn the light on...
I think Ed Begley Jr. has one.
You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.
Tuscany!
(Once again, the audience hears his thoughts) I'm so car sick. I'm gonna vomit!
Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?
I got a date!
Yeah, but this is different , this is like ,you know, semi digested food stuff. You know the next stop is the stomach and you can take it from there.
So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.
(as Newman leaves) Newman!
Course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.
That's my car!
I don't feel like eating.
Okay.
(ranting) I can't believe how a little thing like George going too fast - and my whole weekend is gone - the plans, the packing, ... everything.
I got an idea.
This one?
No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!
Would you turn that down! What is that crap!
Wow! (Jerry spots all the classic toys)
Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.
If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.
(still Patting) I hear a voice.
Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, (looking at the TV) Kramer, turn that up.
Are you that desperate?
Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game.
No actually, she took it pretty well.
And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month!
Except that it's not Putty.
Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! No!!! Thank you. (Hangs up.) I don't believe this. They've added Bania to the network showcase and he's going on right after me.
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
One Tim Whatley!
What?
(still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.
Why? Is that what he told you?
(thinking to himself; picks up a tube) "Fungicide". Fungus?
It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.
Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves)
Who'd you use? Gino?
Well, no, I'm not one of those.
Oh, my god!
And where does it end? Then everyones doin it. Its like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, "Dont go there." - Someones gotta take a stand!
(to himself) Once a week? (to Uncle Leo) So how's Lydia?
My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin' "where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?"
Colin?
So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.
Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.
I don't have it. You want half my omelet? (holds his omelet plate up to Bania)
AH, GOOD FOR YOU.
Where?
A little white dog?
What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him? I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he?
Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.)
Hey, George, you know Tim Whatley.
You're going out with the stationery store guy?
Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets.
(to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here.
Alright! (picks up the phone and dials) Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. You know, you got a great 'John Houseman' name. Alec Berg. Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg?
Oh, no, not Frankie.
How was the rest of Death Blow?
Were still friends.
Look at your skin.
No.
Rachel!
No, go ahead, I second-hand smoke two packs a day.
Well, she's... like you.
Yes, and I returned it in 1971.
More heavy gravy?
He can't just throw me off the plane!
Yeah. Was that a beauty or what?
Is it Famous Ray's?
. . . it's uh, being fixed.
I'm sorry, uh-
Nice shotgun.
Hey Fred.
Are there golf clubs in the back?
I don't know. Nothing.?
I kinda like this opera crowd, I feel tough... Anybody else got a problem?
What're you doing here?
Oh yes, quite.
Hello
I dunno...
Hey!
Ah.
Oh, so you need to know?
You're looking up movies for people now?
Yeah, it is.
No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey)
That is the guy!
Gillian. Hiii..
Not our "all the way", their "all the way." I got the stink of responsibility on me.
Theres nothing to get.
Come in for two minutes and sit with me.
Yeah, I know.
Is that so?
Lemme just check my messages. (to himself) Maybe a nicer girl called.
What you got, a pair of bullets?
So why don't you get a locksmith?
They sell them by the side of the road. Blueberry, Blackberry ....
Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..
See ya'.
Gotta support the team.
You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.)
Well, communism didn't work.
So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya?
I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.
See, now that I don't care for.
(After seeing how much his parents like her) Now, I'm not so sure.
Oh thank you very much.
Oh, no reason. You're into karate right?
What could possess anyone to throw a party? I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.
Yeah.
Can I ask you a question?
Don't ask me!
An overdose of odor? Good question.
So?
Oh yeah, how's that looking?
Hey.
Hey, Lainie, how's the trip going?
She did?
No, no, no, another race - out of the question.
It's unheard of ...
Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?
(hits button) Come on up. (opens door a little)
What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what they're saying.
We're not gettin' that TV.
But the question is, are you still master of your domain?
But I, I didn't, I--
I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?
Hey listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, why don't you have dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if you want, you know, have a little company, take the pressure off.
Spending the night. Optional.
Oh
(extemporising) Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was registered under Slappy White.
Yea?
Broke even.
Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.
Awright, let's eat already.
yeah yeah what is it with you and Tony? what are you? it's like his sidekick now?
Thank you. Nice job.
(to Kramer) I thought you stopped talking??
Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.
Evry-Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. "Oh, is he good?" "Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best." They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, "You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. No, he's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher." And then there's always that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me." Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, "Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. And everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."
I still don't know what the idea is.
What?
Named Sharon?
I think it's off the wagon.
Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.
What is it?
Hi Ralph.
Yes, I know. I've flown before.
Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.
Another ending?
Stomach ache?
(out of window) George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!
Sure, we can do something next week.
All the time.
She's all right.
Babu!
Isn't that against the law?
Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.
Oh, isn't that what it's all about?
Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours?
Really? How?
He's gonna show up anyway.
What's going on?
Hey. What's the matter?
I can't believe this. A 5-19?
All right.
It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go. (to old man that enters) It was GEORGE!
Well, either you see him or you don't.
You went back to the Jockeys?
I don't think I am.
Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?
You got something in your teeth there.
Hi
Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going "boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly."
She faked.
Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?
Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.
Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.
Uh, THANKS! This is FUN! Yeah, this turned out to be a GREAT weekend.
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
I mean all that stuff is so small.. ((ELAINE is wryly assessing him)) stupid..
(walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.
Loni Anderson.
Think she wants those clubs.
osh.
Because you didnt have a job?
Oh, Babu.
No.
Because of Ted Danson.
Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this?
Why do they wear polyester?
On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?
She's got nice calves.
What's going on?
Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... (to himself, cursing her) Mulva!
Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?
Oh boy.
Where is this coming from? She's great!
No, thats great! Thats terrific!
Yeah, it was alright.
So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.
No you don't.
It's a lotta gum!
What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?
So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that...
Hey. What's all this?
Yeah.
Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!
I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.
You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.
Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.
But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.
Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes.
No, you don't have to buy anything.
Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.
Could we continue this another time.
What kind of pen is that?
Really?
Now, I should tell you that, at this point, she's under the impression that youre - a - ah
How many times you been out with him?
I there. This is Kramer, and Frank.
What is this?
Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?
Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.
Oh... oh... wanna get some pizza?
No, not on me.
I think you got it.
All right.
Uncle Leo, wait!
Yes, I heard you.
Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?
Have you tried the hamentashen?
Ahh, too bad you got a little, George Costanza thing going on.
Come on George, just loosen up.
Ah, here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) Mmm, delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some.
Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before. Your hook is too small. This is for, like, a muffin. All right. Take it away.
Oh, boy.
The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.
No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.
So? She used the toothbrush!
The door? You left the door open?
Where's that ticket? Oh, Kramer.
Beautiful.
You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
No foolin'
...You bite it, you bought it.
Does she know?
Hi Julie.
Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people?
Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up.
Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?
Okay.
Oh Moses smell the roses.
Well yes I did that's true. A couple of a guys I knew in the coastguard told me about her.... and I sensed that she had the anger and intensity that I needed to make this film work.
What? What did you--
(To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.
Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?
I like your nails, that is a great color.
I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot.
Lemon Tree.
(Trying to explain) Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past.
Hey look at this. What is going on here?
(on phone)Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.... it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye.
Uh huh?
All the time.
(softly) Hmm.. they'll match my sneakers.
Bye thanks.
I'm not carrying a purse.
Joe DiMaggio? In Dinky Donuts?
Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman...
Hi.
Well I guess if I?m the Miana I should go. All right, all right.
Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.
What are we doing here..
(to Elaine) Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?
No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing. (Jerry picks up the phone and dials the number) I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?
How could she be smarter than you?
What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?
You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry?
An Army Pete.
Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.
There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it..
Well--
(looking at his nostrils) I don't...think so.
Yes, Im lactose intolerant.
Oh, thats okay.
I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing.
Ruthie Cohen?
Oh.
I dont think so. You know they, theyre so fragile.
He's a little backed up.
No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.
He tends to exaggerate.
Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.
Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?
(accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?
Boy, they really worked on your pectorals.
You think I'm too cautious?
Where are you sitting?
Maybe it's a shortcut.
Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?
She's very assimilated.
(While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands him a nickel)
Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess youre not going in anymore.
The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?
Yeah, big surprise.
Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to give it up.
Yeah.. When he's dead he'll be relieved... Oh by the way Viking Press sent a Fedex for you to my parents. They brought it with 'em.
I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.
I can't go until I find my cufflinks.
She's your Lex Luthor!
All right, so uh, let's do something later. How 'bout a movie?
(To bartender) Can I have a club soda? (To Ronnie) Goin' on tonight?
Really.
Women go bald?
Hang on.
They did.
So, I finally met the mentor.
Oh, w-what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore?
You're still with the pact?
Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.
So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?
No, I want the picture back.
Just talking? Well what's the show about?
Yeah.
(nodding awkwardly for a moment) All right, I think we're done here. (Jerry leaves and Phil shuts the door darkly)
oh.. uh.. you know your breath is a little garlicky you better take some gum.
Alright Elaine.
"I think I was tucked.!"
All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?
I know.
No I can't, maybe you're faking.
Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.
Alright!
Yeah.
Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Yknow Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, shes probably screamin at those aliens, I gotta have a lo mein!
George this is Mickey.
And the other.
I didn't--
What am I gonna say?
Hey, Georgie!
Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit) And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.
This puddle on my sofa!
Yeah.
Elaine, this is Corinne.
So, you've done this?
Yeah.
Why not?
Well, it's a spider.
Yeaaaah!!!
(Screams) GET OUT!
Good. How was the roulette?
He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?
Thank you.
Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
All right, you're beyond stink.
Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie "Cinderfella". I got 'em at an auction.
Ah, who are any of her losers?
Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later.
Who?
Yeah, but...
I was going to say, "Being a good host."
(reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.
You won't.
Not from the footage I've seen.
Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.
As a guy I dont know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I dont know how to say, Bill, I feel I need to see other men. Do you know what I mean? Theres nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think thats the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because theyre two guys. Thats almost all we need to have in common. Cause sports  sports and women  is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, So, whats in the refrigerator?
What?
No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex.
(Surprised to see her, he gets up) Where's George?
Now you're talkin' crazy!
I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.
Is that a thick marble?
Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.
All right, all right, I?ll wear this. It's bad enough I?ve got to go to the opera I?ve got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here.
Me either.
I want that rye, lady!
Well, we're changing the rules.
No hello?
Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?
Yeah, Koko.
Alright.
Yeah. Yeah.
(Fed up) Alright! Excuse me! (Gets up) I'm not buying any of this!
She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.
That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. Its like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you doing today?
What?!
Oh, Okay (turns to rest of table) Im sorry, I didnt know what to bring, nobody told me.
Nah, Ill go get the robe.
Nice to meet you.
Now, all we gotta do is write it.
I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?
I knew it.
Give me that rye!
Well if he's going then I'm not going.
Dont get up.
Exactly
Im Dan. Can I have my list back, please?
He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.
'90.
Where you going?
I don't know. That's like asking "Where's Waldo?"
(seeing Kramer struggle to open a soda, spilling it all over) I think the damage is probably already done. (interrupting Kramer's inadequate attempt to clean up the soda) All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene.
Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.
If you don't believe me, ask her.
It was sold out!
Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.
You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?
What's this all about?
I've gained eight.
These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86.
The exact same outfit.
I suppose you think your bombable.
Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.
True. You mean, for you?
Oh, you know.
Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.
. . . Poor bastard.
Well he's kind of modest.
Youre a cashier!
What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?
Oh.
Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.
That's a 180, George.
I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.
Acting.
I remember that night.
(Looking away) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.
Oh, no, not beautiful.
How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a minute. Poppy's from Tuscany. I'm gonna go call him.
Do I really have to explain why?
You kept makin' all the stops?
Oh yeah.
Well thank you very much, it's about time.
Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!
Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?!
No, I believe he can.
And you misinterpret this how?
Nah, I don't wanna go.
(Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.
Hard to say.
You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.
They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!
Like toothpaste?
Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for membership.
Oh, Where did you eat?
Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
Oh, the sisters (he sits at the table)
I can do that.
"So what did Tim say?"
Youre movin in, youre a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars. (Elaine is shocked, Jerry opens the door to the hall.) Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I dont even wanna see it, go, get it out.
(still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.
Where'd you get the bricks?
Oh, I cant. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly.
He's joking.
I gotta go meet Pam.
We're having the intervention for Richie.
So ,Who is he?
Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.
(Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my domain. But I will tell you this I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!
George...
Oh, I wouldnt quite say that.
So, how's everything going?
Great, its yours. I can't stand the sight of it. Elaine, heres the car keys. (tosses her the keys)
What did you do to my car?!
This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.
He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.
Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?
What?
Yeah.
Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. Shes usually pretty punctual. Dont you find that, George?
Satisfied?
(Shrugs) Oops. (Continues walking along the route, whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street, then keeps walking)
Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?
But -
Oh boy.
What happened to your head when you got hit?
We made plans.
No, I just had a sandwich.
B.L.?
"Big head" (Scoffs) That's almost a compliment.
Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.
You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown?
I never heard anybody curse in a toast.
Uh-huh.
Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''. And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. "Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''.
Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.
No, but he would've read your face.
What's the matter with you?
See ya. (Jane Leaves; after the door closes Kramer jumps in shock) what's with you?
(Nauseated at the saying) Would you please stop saying that?!
But I was promised this slot.
Stop shouting! You're ruining the reception.
Oh, come on.
All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! (Audience boos)
Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the bottle of fungicide.)
Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.
Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.
Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll never get another date with her. She'll freak out.
So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister...
Yeah.
No, go ahead.
Cindy.
All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go.
What if he doesn't call now out of spite?
Yeah, let me just stop by the cash machine and I'll meet you over at the coffee shop.
I got one problem. Youre keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that shes coming.
Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it.
Tell me what?
Aren't you going to take the check down?
Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.
No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.
I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!
About what?
For what dinner?
Well at least you and I are okay again.
That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
Let's get outta here. [to Buckles] I'll see ya.
This is insane. You know, I dont even know where shes staying! She, shes not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.
Did you bring the keys?
I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. (casually leaves)
There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts.
Is that something you want to do?
Hi
Yeah.
...ho-ah. It's, it's, it's kitschy.
Im supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?
Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?
All right, she said she couldnt find a decent hotel room...
What is that smell?
What is it that isn't working?
Riverside Park.
So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!
Unbelievable! She's not there.
Newman?
I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.
What's his last name?
Then what do you call it? People dont just bump into each other and have sex. This isnt cinemax.
You don't even know what a write off is.
All right!
You know, the water pressures terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower.
Actually, we met in the gym locker room.
You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.
So were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.
How am I going to live with myself?!
I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.
I'm sorry, really.
Yes, they do!
No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.
Ohhhh...
So you want to just abolish all home package deliveries.
I couldn't do it without you.
(sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.
Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of deadbeats.
It's like we're living in the '50s here.
No!
All right! Lunch!
Well goody for you.
She didn't stay over?
Well, uh, I uh, I dont want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe its not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.
(picks up phone) Hello? (listens) Oh, hi Mr. Pitt.
(Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here.
That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.
Uncle Leo!
(to George) Keep going.
Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.
Today's not my birthday.
Here.
C'mon!
No.
It's just a drawing.
Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a little. .
I didn't call her till today.
Yeah. Come on up.
There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.
Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?
What kind of plans?
How fast was she walking?
So, Im on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the...
Oh yeah, that's the spot...
What?
I dont know. Theyve been in there since, like, World War II. The rents three hundred a month.
(Walks over and starts pulling on Kramer's pants) You just gotta wiggle your hips a little bit.
What! You're the one who ruined her life.
Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?
(in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.
You're meetin' the father for the first time?
They nailed you on the 20 G's?
Right.
Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana.
Donna, really, youre making too much of this.
(testing Joel) So, Im thinking about going to Iran this summer.
What?
Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.
I reckon.
You know, I really... Ive come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that theyre just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you dont really wanna see them. You dont call them, they call you. You dont call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you dont really have anything in common with is to pretend youre hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend theres a little desk around you. The only problem with this is theres no way you can say, Hey, its been great having you on the show. Were out of time.
What's that?
A little less beady today.
So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye.
Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up(?). Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.
How are we gonna get out of it?
Vandelay Industries, Kel Varnsen speaking. May we help you? ... Oh Hi Keith. Na, I was just jokin' around
Walk me down to the Friars.
Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. (indicating) Come on in. You got the cigars?
Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!
What?
[his interest piqued] Minsk?
Nothing.
Yknow I think that even if youve had a relationship with someone, or lets say, especially if youve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, its very difficult. Isnt this? Its hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. Its like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, Look, a rabbit. The other goes, So? I believe this is your card. Look, why dont we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?
Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?
Hey.
Yeah.
Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?
He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh)
But I might.
What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up.
(Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing?
What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?
Hey, maybe I should get Elaine something.
I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say.
"What's that?"
Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.
yeah without a doubt, I'm down (Kramer enters) oh hey how're you doing? Jane this is my neighbor Kramer
No ,no I don't, I mean, Don't be silly..
No, no......(long pause . they stare at the walls) Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?
What are you doing?
Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?
I live in New York. (slams the cab door) What the hell happened?
I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, that were manufactured in Korea.
Hey, how's life on the road?
That?s what I?ll do, I?ll just call him and tell him, I?ll tell him. That?s all I?ll do. He's a human being, I?ll talk to him. He'll understand. Right?
Well, that was the worst.
George?
(incredulous) Oh, come on!
Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump over the net.
So you want to go to the party on Friday night?
Oh! No it's Sally Weaver.
Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.
She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.
Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?
Yeah, I know. There's no call for that kind of attitude.
(on the phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second. (George walks in  Jerry asks George) So we definitely dont want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes his head NO) Alright, were back together again, great. Bye bye.
What? No.
You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.
Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, "Make sure you hang on to your jacket."
Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason.
Happy Festivus!
Why aren't you there now?
What?
think I've changed my mind.
You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.
It's European.
A smirk?
I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.
But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.
Oh, I forgot to call Christie.
With a gentleman caller?
Nice try.
Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" or, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" You emphasize "Jerry" or "bring."
Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?
No, Elaines got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and hes suppose to do it.
A long, long weekend.
Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your..
Does it smell like the East River?
The store.
Yeah. That's true.
She's drunk out of her mind.
You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.
So, you're just taking off from work?
(holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the fridge?
You've got really specific tastes.
Maybe.
Hi Jack.
(extemporising) That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go.
And what, hope for a crash?
Y'know, I think I'll pass on the "Guys And Dolls"...
Sure.
What?! Wha... what'd you put in there?
Is he from the future?
yeah
If I told you, you woulda given it away.
Why?
No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car.
A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning..
I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. "The New Yorker is stealing my ideas." ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real.
What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him? 'Cos I asked him about the Knicks?
Oh yeah I like this idea.
Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?
You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story??
It's not a purse. It's European!
Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?
(finishing) The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.
Oh boy, can you smell it?
Why don't you get somebody else?
Nothing...
Hey, lll just keep swimming. Hey, hey. Im not done. I know what you're up to Ramon. Because Im a member here, this is my place to swim.
Really? How come you never pursued her before?
Having a cup of coffee.
I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.
Just a quick peek. I'm in agony.
All right...
"Just one....gotta go back.....Oh but get this. Elaine, you will appreciate this. I'm sitting in Tim Whatley's waiting room...He's got a Penthouse right out on the table."
Why did you give him MY number?
Well, I don't think that's gonna happen.
Religion, my friend, thats what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that its going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.
Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one.
's not necessary.
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.
That's funny, that's funny! "I'm sick of cleaning." That's very funny.
Should we walk him around?
No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.
You see , I kept up my end of the pact.
(to the man) Excuse me. Mister Benes?
Hey come on, you're getting it all over the floor!
Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.
What do you mean you don't know?
Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again)
Well what do you suggest?
No, forget it, I'm gonna call.
So quit!
Newman's his mailman.
I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.
You gotta shake it up.
So they have hotdogs there.
You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?
Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...
Well they do work on tips.
Gwen?
Oh, the Yoo Hoo?
What do you think it could've been just some dude?
Elaine! No! No!
Maybe youre right.
I dont wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do you think?
Right you are.
Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch?
(Stops) Alright, that's not gonna work, it's not gonna work. Let me just think for a second here.
At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.
I'm afraid we're out of time.
(taking back the check) Oh yeah.
They guy's in my house right now. What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.
What was all that sniffing?
Why not?
Good, good.
C'mon. Just sit down!
You're saying I'm responsible for the couch?
Clean as a whistle.
Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time.
What are you doing?
What is it?
Kramer, give me that rooster!
Well, break a leg tonight.
I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes.
I don't even know if I remember the number.
There's a naked woman across the street.
No! He stole my move!
oh you think she's Erika, the phone sex woman
Oh.
Knicks? Rangers?
What's the matter?
Im a guy  it always looks like that.
Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat!
Yeah.
No, I haven't heard anything.
(doubtful) There's crepe money?
You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?
What's that?
Well Lisi, that was another-
You know that awning outside my building?
Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?
Hey.
Gwen! How'd you know I was here?
Well what about her?
Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, "Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land." (Imitates cannon operator) "I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you."
What are you doing?
You and your toilets.
oh.. Jane she uh.. she uh..
Jerry Seinfeld.
Huh. Kurt's an organ donor.
Hmm. That looks new.
It.
Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.
What?
Well, Clyde might not tell him.
Good, good.
That's what I thought.
Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough!
Nothin'.....nothing at all.
Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you.
Ya broke my blender, didnt ya?
No, what? Thats probably why..
What do you do?
Good-bye, Koko.
Ooh.
George.
Get out of here!
For what?
(turns) Newman.
Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.
Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?
So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) "Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again." They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system..."Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to the plane in my apartment." You see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet "hide-a-key" under the wing..."maybe he left it up there somewhere..."
It's a little short.
First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, "Didn't you see my signal?" "Look at that fender!" ..Then you'd see a real fight.
I don't want a van.
No, you walk out.
Who wouldn't like him? I like him. And I'm a guy.
Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry.
She never sees the big picture.
Friday night.
(Agreeing) What's more important?
But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?
I'M NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT!!
Hey.
Problem in the bedroom?
(to the Barneys sales associate) Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?
I think I offended the wake-up guy...! (worried)
Where's Kramer?
What?
(to waiter) Ill have a cranberry juice with two limes.
If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!
(indicating) This is Elaine Benes.
You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.
Know *what*?
Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here (points to kitchen), here (points to living room), or here (makes similar circle with his hands).
(to George) Snow. Snow, that cant be good for suede, can it?
Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.
I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
No, people hate that.
Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay.
Yeah?
A circus?
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?
yeah stinks, terrible
Yeah, but now Im nervous.
Oh, okay, thanks.
Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet?
They have gotten to know you.
Where did you get that?
you're making sandwiches?
Indeed.
So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.
(to Kramer) To the right.
(laughing) Oh you must have done something.
What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present)
How's work going you guys?
You asked a date to go to the operation?
Kramer...
Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please leave.
No.
Oh wait. Ill go with you.
Uh-huh.
How come you didn't tell me?
Come on. Come on.
Mm. That's fantastic. (he could care less)
I agreed to wear this?!
Yeah, that's right.
Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.
(stunned) Is that right?
(to himself) Still a rip-off.
Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.
This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-
I have some questions of my own.
(to Elaine) Where's Kramer? Shouldn't he be here by now.
Okay....too bad.
(Puts his hand over his mouth) What?
What is it?
Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?
Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?
You gotta be there at 430.
I didn't know you had a motorctcle.
Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender! (an event guard stops them)
And, best of all, it's a Cadillac.
(passing Hallie) 'Scuse me.
(pushes George) NOT THAT YOU IDIOT!!
Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!
For both of us.
Tippy Toe? I dont think so.
Hi.
Oh yeah? What did he say?
So, are you gonna go out with her?
Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?
"Naaaaaa...I can't watch a man sing a song."
Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
That's your problem, you should be.
I really wanna have fun.
Ah ha...
"Jerry"!
(doing the voice) La la la.
How do you like that.
Take care now. So long.
Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!
Hello, Newman.
Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.
No, of course not.
Yeah. You almost ruined his life's work.
How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean, it's only this wide!
Susan!
Would you stop?
(answering phone) Hello?
(Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining room doorway) I think the busboy's in trouble.
...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code.
(disappointed) Answering machine. (jovially) Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.
He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?
So?
Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie.
Come on, lets go.
She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.
He might not want nothing.
Beautiful!
Yeah, what else?
Absolutely.
What was that?
I know, I know.
Yes, I know youre not gonna do it. Thats why I bet.
Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.
No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?
You're not a little anything, Newman. So just pack it up and move it out of here.
(before disappearing himself) Punk.
I just hope that whole pony incident didnt put a damper on the trip.
To a children's charity!
Oh, you're crazy.
Bug guy.
"That's the guy?"
Well, whatever. So, how've you been?
Mine too, love the 12 gauge.
But we already knew that.
I like that. (He opens the closet. Elaine walks out with an angry look.) What do you think, George?
Ok...
I don't want any!
Leo?
Oh relax, Katie. It's not a problem.
Aub, ah, Gipple?
What for?
what?
Didja leave a message?
So what did you do?
Relax. Who are they?
Hey, look whose here - Puddy.
Oh, I cant begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.
I cant believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.
We'll still make the movie.
What car?
So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.
Oh, really?
Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen "Girlie" Brown would be very proud of you.
She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.
No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.
Plantains?
What song?
I might need you to get me a soda.
I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... (Jerry stops, and mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica on the phone at work.)
There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
(pointing at Georges shirt) See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. Its too high! Its in no-mans-land. You look like you live with your mother.
Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.
Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.
No, it's not that, it's the...
Oh, no. It is. Just be still.
This is Lois.
Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents.
What do you need them for?
Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.
Ah! right...nice. Lunch with Elaine?
. . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?
Couple of interviews.
(Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.
That's terrible...
I have some idea.
Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, "Why knock my brains out?"
Really?
The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
Killed?
No. I never had a job.
But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.
It's not that bright orange one is it?
Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits)
Now thats not fair! So where did you meet this guy?
She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?
I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now.
Come on up.
Hey. So how was"Blame it on the Rain?"
So uh, what do you think?
Well, I cant wear it.
What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like theyre trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?
I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.
I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.
I'll get you another one just like it!
Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made.
Hey. What are you doing?
Fire engines?
Hey, hey. I understand. Youre businessmen.
hey Kramer
(Pointing) He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..
George!
No I wasn't there. (enters and slams the door)
I forgot.
That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great! (he starts to install the table)
Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?
You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me.
Oh.
Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.
I mean the whole thing, it's just...
(Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not.
Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.
Dollars?
Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do?
Yeah, I liked him.
Next Wednesday.
Oh, I'll split a cab with you.
What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?
(somber) That's wonderful news. Thank you.
Um, I haven't got my watch on. It's being fixed.
Well, so that's that.
You quit the post office?
Hi! How 'r u doing?
How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?
Obviously never.
What's with the signs?
Hey, Bobby, over here.
I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.
Oh, its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.
Shut up, you old bag!
Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?
Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing?
What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.
Come on.
At a rodeo. Where's she moving?
I read it in Ann Landers.
You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.
He's a comedian.
He used to go there a lot on business.
Did you call me a wuss?
We'll see.
All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! Just wait here and I'll get it for you. ... Kramer this is Tia.
Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia, watching Jerry on TV. Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.
Wood is good.
Still with the neck hole?
How do you know she's not my wife?
Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! (Kramer is speechless) I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm..
So listen...
We just met.
Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.
So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.
What do you need a job, you got Audrey.
Things are good?
No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, hes treatin me just like a regular customer, now!
Hey.
Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
What do you say to a person like you?
Rhode Island.
(into phone) Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. (to George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!
(smiling) Really? That's great. You said that to him?
Yeah, Ill have the egg salad on whole wheat.
What about your father's car?
Whatever.
Oh! Hey!
(to drive him crazy) Who is this..
"I don't think so. I think they were getting dressed and not only that; my shirt was out!!!"
What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police dont use them for, you know, crowd control. (Jerry crouches down, and makes like hes riding a pony.) Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, Im talking to you. Behind the barricades! So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldnt it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... Baltic, thats two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, thats it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.
Theres a lot of people to mock...
Why?
(Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?
Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
Weight? Naw. Just need some more height.
Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?
(Looking down at the shirt; mumbling) Oh, thank you.
"Is this guy a dentist or Caligula?"
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me.
I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.
(hearing the noises) What's happening!
What is this?
Cheque. Now, the fact is, if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, yknow, cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they dont know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster (Jerry draws imaginary book from a holster.) Who do I make it out to? Theres my ID. Theres something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I dont know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, I dont have any money, but if youll contact these people, Im sure theyll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I dont have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?
Euhh...Elaine....
Yeah so?
The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?
What if hes in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (Jerry knocks on imaginary glass.) How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? (He makes a hissing sound.) By the way, whats happening with Sendrax?
But I don't know if this is gonna work.
Ahh! She threw me out.
The lake isn't real.
Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers?
Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.
(nonplused) You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?
Is that a fact?
Not for another three days.
You want me to take an overview?
This is amazing.
I know. I was just...
Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.
You don't drink.
Here we go.
Alright. (Hangs up)
This is the man you have a crush on?
Ah, just remember when you see him tomorrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him.
Well, I...
No, nothing.
Hey.
Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?
You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're lifting heavy suit cases.
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.
She's the model I met on the plane.
Really!
Date with Karen?
Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour, then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night.
Is it a lot of cream soups?
(throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?
Can we go out there?
Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.
Hey, come on!
Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.
Can I try it?
Come on.
I mean it's a terrible mistake, I mean he thinks I ruined some deal of his at NBC, I don't know anything about any deal at NBC.
Let's put him over here.
Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.
This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!
She's got really nice hair.
What do you think? It's like a poker game?
I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club...
AH. Yes that's gonna make a big difference.
Why what did I do?
Why are we flyin' over the Andes?
Yeah, sure.
Well it was my idea.
I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' (mimes throwing) 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?
No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him.
You don't understand, ah
No!
Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
Hi shmoopy.
That's my cockney accent.
Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!
Does it matter?
Which one do you think I want?
That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.
Did you tell her you loved her?
(admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.
Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!
(on the phone) Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.
Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.
Oh, Bruline. Newman's got the same one.
Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?
What's goin' on?
I know. Neighbors.
I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?
Yes.
Oh yeah, right...
is that so?
No, no, no ugly side.
I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or somebody? What's with this guy? (Gino looks at him annoyed) Just asking.
Kramer! What are you doing?!
Oh. that would be great.
You are. I can't get that thing in my car. (referring to George)
Whatever it is.
How's your confidence level?
Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 650 AM tomorrow morning.
Bedroom.
Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.
The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.
Yeah, see ya.
What?
Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down. (To Elaine) What?
Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.
Is that so?
Why don't you see what you can do?
Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?
Wonder about what?
No, I'm not...
How did they know?!
Whew
Id rather not say it out loud. Its embarrassing.
(knocking) Hey, Jenna. Hey!
I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? "You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know "No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back."
Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.
...what?
I cant. What if he wakes up?
So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table
It's softer.
The wheels are in motion, things are happening!
You got the tickets?
Im not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll em down below my knee?
He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught.
Well, that's where it gets tricky.
George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods)
I can see that! What happened?
Keep it. (implied please)
Hold it. Broccoli? Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce.
(Trying to ward her off) Hey. Hey!
Yes.
Hey!
Ah, she's okay.
I'm not touching that thing.
Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone to ghost read it.
(subdued, almost somber) Hello. Welcome back.
Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?
No. No thanks.
We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.
So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!
"Glamour"?
Hey. What happened to you yesterday?
Yeah, he seems pretty happy.
I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.
So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?
You know, Kramer's gonna clean up on this place.
I only knew you through Moochie.
Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.
Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.
So what happened with Tatiana?
I want to but I can't.
Let go, Elaine!
Yeah!
Absolutely.
You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.
So was I right? She likes me, right?
You haven't even seen it.
I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!
Can we just go in already?
Uh-huh.
I think he knew.
Can you believe it?!
(proudly) I am...the master packer.
Never happened.
What, it...it's here in the building?
Well, where is she?
(Sarcastic) Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.
What does that mean?
And I'm always impressed.
The New York Yankees?!
I don't believe this. (They run into theater)
So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything.
Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.
(grunting as he throws bread into the air)
How's it coming?
What happened to you? You were going like a hundred miles an hour.
Oh, then I'm not worried.
She died? Mrs. Hudwalker died?
I'm watching Edward Scissorhands.
(upset) Ohhhh, what are you doing? Kessler, its a tape! I taped the game, its one oclock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.
Hey, ??? is rerunning the Yankee game. You watching this?
You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?!
I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...)
That's right, you let him have it.
Sure!
You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.
I didn't know she would laugh.
Hey, look at the high score--"G.L.C." George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?
You got sorbitant sesquioliate?
Im in for five...
Pretend it's interesting.
Yes it is. I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior.
Pamela? Do I know her?
Good, fine.
I don't know if they have land guys.
Be right back. (follows Kramer out)
Faster than a speeding bullet Lois.
Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.
That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little off.
Few hundred grand?
Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up)
Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. Weve been doing this silly, dumb voice.
Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?
Right, you were leaving.
Oh, you'll find out.
So what are you up to?
So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you.
But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--
No, hed go nuts.
And you're the model for this perfume?
You're lying! You got it, I want that number!
"Salami salami bologna"?
Over here?
(picks it up) I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table.
Oh, hi.
Yeah, me too.
Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know its missing, and he took it! And of all things to take! I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. Hes crazy.
What is this? "Murphy Brown"?
Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.
Yeah
Look at my picture!
Because, HE'S my directions.
Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.
Actually, that's the definition of selfish.
How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?
They lost.
So what about the "Maestro" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.
I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.
What?
Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.
With the little legs?
(standing in the bathtub) Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.
(laconic) We're already in a hospital.
Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!
What for? Oh come on.
Is my toaster oven on there?
Oh! There coming to town tomorrow by the way.
Sadly, that knowledge could've help me.
Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.
Where am I going to look?
The one with the Poppie stain?!
Well, I still think it's wrong.
(re the underwear pile) Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
Hairdo?
I'm sorry too.
All right. We're broken up.
I don't want it..
She might be. She's the star of the show.
I don't care, why are you telling me this?
Naw, I gotta wait until its just the right time.
He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.
They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again.
You didn't like that crack about the pen.
What for?
All right, go ahead
That's right, lady!
For how long?
They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.
What does that mean?
Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer!
I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
Is he still in town?
Well, you know what they say. Lucky in love, Unlucky with fruit.
I didn't know she was married.
Oh. No. What, you mean because of the "Chang"?
(grimaces and takes the shovel back) I'll dig.
Ohhh, moisture?
Hey, were kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?
You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.
What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead.
That's so funny!
Big matzoh ball.
Hum, well it all comes as news to me.
He never heard of corduroy! True story, true story.
Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How many of those did we go to?
So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up The good, the bad, or the ugly.
I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.
I'm clean and you know it.
You still using that old alarm clock?
I know, George told me.
Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered? (Sees the pac) What happened?
Respect, admiration, prestige.
"So what about the Penthouse. Did you ask him?"
So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.
What could you have done?
(into phone) Hello Joe, listen this is Jerry Seinfeld, I really think there?s been a huge colossal misunderstanding,
Ahh.
Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? Theres Elastic Man... Plastic Man...
Alright, we're coming down.
Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.
George, Stacey.
I see. She's looking.
"Where's my Mr. Goodbar?"
I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket.
All right, what is this?
``Rochelle Rochelle'', huh?
.. and uh, underwear and a tee shirt.
Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . What could he do?
You're a Genius!
It does other things!
Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer?
(Cheerfully) Well, a law's a law. (Leaves)
Can I help you?
You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.'
Where'd you get those?
A wuss?
Oh, alright ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....
Yeah?
I didn't know that...
(To George) I said I was sorry.
Let me see that. (Jerry looks at the tag.) That is high.
Come on up.
Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.
Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.
I'm not giving you her number.
By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?
No.
Oh... *you*...
We gotta confess.
Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? Im sorry. I didnt mean it. I took it out on you. Were still friends. Were still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, Ill tell you what. Ive got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.
Because I gave it to you.
What are you doing?
Yikes!
Come on, Kramer, get out of there.
I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go "Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!"
I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.
I'm looking for a crested blazer
I'm a joke maker.
Thanks , thanks
hey where were you last night? I looked for you, I didn't see you
Is that my towel?
It's alright, I want you to have it.
(looks at watch) Ten-thirty.
You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.
Kra _ mer!
Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. and we got to talking, he sells Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.
The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?
Y- you're not playin' golf?
Kramer, should I call Susan?
See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.
I tell ya, I don't see it happening.
(confused) He what?
No, it's stupid.
And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!
Saturday night (she leaves)
(sarcastic) Oh, great.
I thought naked is good.
Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?
A half hour, give me a half our.
Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal right now. (covers Jean-Paul with a blanket)
I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.
Robert.
(with no emotion) It's okay. Everything is going to be all right.
By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
Why not?
Hi Elaine.
Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
Me? What about you?
I said no! (hangs up the phone.)
How'd you do on the IQ test?!
Ah, no, forget it.
Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go.
You didnt see him. It was horrible.
Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.
Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it.
You want to go to Mendys, Ill take you to Mendys.
So, what's on your mind?
Really, an intervention ...
Just put it under your shirt.
Yeah, all right.
Desperado?
Did you talk to her?
You're marchin' in.
Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.
She broke up with you?
What do you mean? They know we're here.
Everyday is my birthday. (Sarcastically joking off what George said)
He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.
(looking at the Wizard) Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents.
Oh, you were pretty loaded.
What?
You can't prove anything.
I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.
The ticket is worthless.
Yeah, that's right.
I gave a look?
Kramer's guys?
You asked her out?
Sure.
Yeah, college was fun.
Yeah, well you're going.
George - could I have a word?
So, where am I dropping you?
Well, what kind of solid?
Well how are you going.....
(Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla.
That's what she told me!
(Stopping the notion) What's that?
Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! (Kramer exits.)
Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
She wants to talk.
(negative) Eehh.
Hang on.
Yes.
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?
Coming.
I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.
Hi.
Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?
You know Dad just called me.
Oh, I'm Jerry.
Yes, shocking brutality don't you think?
Yeah, killed. Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark.
Today's not cold.
What's going on?
We won. Were in the finals on Wednesday.
Can he communicate?
(gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!
How's it going?
You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.
Look Ramon, about the other day. Im sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway.
Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'
What?
Yeah, yeah, lucky me. (sips coffee)
Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.
Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in your friend John Germaine's band there.
Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.
you're fine (goes to the bathroom)
(catching keys) ...back, please?
He's got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, Jerry notices one of the movie goers) Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?
(Pointing ahead) Look out!
Uh, yeah. (broaching a subject) Hey uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to a meeting.
Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.
Oh my... that *is* refreshing...
See...women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel...
Alright, alright, I'll do it!!
Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen.
(He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.
I dunno. (Elaine enters.) Hey.
Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?
Boy, he took it hard.
W-w-wha' you got in there?
Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them.
That was him?
Talk to Beth?
No kidding?
Hey Richie
Ive got the softball game on Wednesday. Its the championship.
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?
Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!
Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm.
Right.
I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it.
Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.
Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did!
And she wants to break up with you..
Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.
The uh toilet brush is under the sink.
(thinking) So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?
I'm not a foodie. I don't, "Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty." Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book. What is this? The story of the bill? "Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.." What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating from the restaurant? What is this about?
Compact, lipstick, all this?
Great job.
Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you.
Jerry.
What? I said right.
Well? What do you think?
No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.
Where you going?
Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?
Hello Newman.
Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?
What's in?
All right
His father..
I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?
Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.
Yeah, Im sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.
(Pulls the note out of his pocket) That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.
What are you up to?
Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?
Kramer... (points to Marla)
YEAH? (speaking loudly so the visitor can hear him through the intercom)
Vaya con dios.
I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that couldn't be.
Hi. Hi Winona. Nice to see you again.
No, actually I was just gonna...
Oh, George Costanza , Kennedy High.
That's what a gym teacher once told me.
Depends.
Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!
Oh, its just this stupid thing.
It had fat in it, it's not good for you.
I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.
Oh, okay..
Oh! my God!....
How do you know THAT?
Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...
We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.
Yeah.
Come on,c'mon
Oh, Im sorry. Im just waiting for someone.
I can ball park it.
Really?
Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.
Maybe you just didn't see him.
It's like a game of tag.
I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.
No, Mr. Field, look, really I'm--
Hand it over. Pay up.
Tell you something...I do.
What? What?
Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father.
Why can't I buy my father a car?
Hello, Newman.
(Pointing) Hey, there's Leo.
Actually, I did. I put it on last night and slept in it.
Get outta here!
How'd you expect to get out of here?
(to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? (wondering what the hell's Kramer doing)
He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.
Listen to this "I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."
I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.
Where do they make yours?
Get Out of my House!!.
I could tell.
No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter (pauses) Oh no!
Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.
Oh, o.k. (Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.)
You think she's got toes for thumbs?
They got away.
Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're puttin' it in my box now.
You're saying something.
I-I'll tell 'em
Well, what's going on? What is this thing?
So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!
Not you! The guy in the Amigo.
He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.
What the hell he's supposed to be on medication I don't understand he told me he's getting medication what happened to his medication!?
You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.
Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!
No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture.
Hey.
What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's - it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it, and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you. (Nodding)
Hey.
No.
This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.
Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?!
Why?
So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?
The % thing to do is just not think about it.
Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?
I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, "This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here."
Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?
You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.
Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.
What kind do you use?
Well, is Elaine here?
Yeah.
I didn't care.
So you want me to return it?
What happened?
(Sarcastic) Oh, I'm sure she'll come around.
Who are you describin'?
You think that's funny?
Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it!
(impassive) Ah, I'm a little turned off.
I don't know, she just sits there.
Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! Nice job on the circumcision but it's not supposed to be a finger.
Hell have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
How can he not know that?
Write it off what?
You're nuts!
It is exciting.
Are you taking the Tony to Sardi's?
Excuse me?
Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.
Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.
What are doing here now?
Oh hi.
Hi oh.
(interrupting) "Elaine , I really don't...............pay much attention to men`s faces."
You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught.
Yes!
No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.
Oh, I don't believe this.
Too romantic.
Pam? What about Pam?
Hey, Copernicus?
Oh, I'm gonna puke.
How you gonna hold it on there?
She got anything in your medicine cabinet?
It's not true!
You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?
Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god. Wel-- how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud.
What happened?
Yes. Right above me.
Im a nice guy.
I know!
(examining the button) Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like a tooth.
Back to my place. That's right.
That's right. You're emotional.
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?
Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?
Well, I don't think I want to date a protg whose mentor is a Costanza.
Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!
(disoriented) How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?
I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!
Well, I painted my apartment again. Ive been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, its a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize its just the thickness of the paint, but Im aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, its closer and closer. I dont even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. Thats where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control... Thats why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching TV. Thats why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there.
So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.
Yup.
Imagine, spelling Mom with two Os.
He's joking.
Huh.
Yes, it was.
I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that.
You really should.
What am I gonna say?
Oh now I see. (Buzzer) Yeah.
That is right, somebody else was driving.
Its great! It speeds up the intimacy level. Its like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish (snaps his fingers) three days.
About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?
He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes.
Wow!
You were watchin'? Where?
It was wonderful.
What the hell is going on here?
What do you got there?
(noncommittal) Errh.
Yeah.
I loaned the car to George.
Why?
you moved into a hotel?
Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.
Did you shake it up?
Come on.
Ill have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price?
Really?
Really? What would you do?
Uh-huh.
How much was it to clean the vest?
When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.
(snaps fingers) Now that you mention it.
There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her
It's not legitimate.
I don't either.
What about?
Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye.
Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?
(on the phone) Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Ya. Oh, really? Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye. (hangs up the phone) Well, the yogurt verdict is in. (Kramer looks at Jerry with his arms out) Fat!
Nice!
No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?
I can't.
(to Kramer and Morty) What is this about?
No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!
So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?
Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.
Thanks.
Do you want to go with him? You go. I dont mind.
Hey, how was baby-sitting?
You don't know? Come on, that's gold!
Well, thats a lot of money. But, if thats the way its gotta be, thats the way its gotta be.
Just had a big bowl of Kix.
Few do.
I cant. I got to meet Clare.
No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?
What am I drinking, milk?
You like the couch? Ill tell you what Im gonna do.
Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?
Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!
I didnt tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog?
I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.
Is it a good one?
Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...
What are you telling him for?
Elaaaiinne...
You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
(Pointing out) It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for "Avast ye matey" - what the hell does that mean?! "20 degrees off the starboard side - the Spanish Galleon!" - there's no comeback for that!
Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?
The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too.
It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.
Yeah.
Yes he did.
They're mysterious little fellows aren't they?
You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin them whenever I want!
Oh... Why Fusilli?
Comes in a wide variety of colors.
It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes the door) Give me that back.
Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.
That's a great place!
I'm sorry.
Oh my god, it's...
No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.
Oh, please...
Just clarifying.
No, we don't care, we just want to go.
No, no, 12-8!
(also wearing a moustache) What do you mean, 'what is it?' It's a country right next to Belgium.
Aww!
Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, "Oh. Tube socks." What are you gonna do about it?
$40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
Drawer.
Oh, man!
I'm telling you, she's good looking.
Yeah.
No, it's-
Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to Elaine)
George.
(referring to George's outfit) And what mood is this.
(pause) I thought you said... "ridicurous." (Donna looks puzzled)
[quizzically] Live together?
Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!
Elaine.
Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?
Oh, come on!
Yeah. Howd ya do that?
No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
You crying from "Home Alone"??
Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you?
oh you're crazy
Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.
She didn't even want a napkin.
No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.
Oh. (Adjusts accordingly)
What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.
George...
See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.
I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!
Hey, is Davola outside?
Right, right, the tractor story.
Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?
Well how long you are going to keep this up?
(reaching into his pocket) Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for it.
Well, I'm great.
You collect TV Guide?
The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.
Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.
Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!
Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.
What is that, the Empire State Building?
No, it&Mac226;s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i...
I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation.
I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give!
That's not what I do.
(Knocking on Kramer's door) Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey.
Yeah? Whered he go, to an arcade?
Well, what do you mean?
You're not paying.
Non-fat yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it.
That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.
Well...
OK.
No, Ill go. Im going.
Tonight.
'Cause that's what's gonna happen.
(To Elaine) So, the worst is over?
You mean you just started sniffing?
Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
(to himself) Gotta be an easier way.
Loleola?
The Bizarro coffeeshop?
Where's George
September 21st, first day of Autumn. Leaves changing colours.. Beautiful colors.
Huh? Huh?
He's definitely in Chicago.
Yeah, yeah. Sometimes shes on time, and... sometimes shes late.
We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, hey maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!?
I wouldn't think so.
Hey - how was the beach?
Like this? (imitates the walk)
What do you mean, "kind of."?
Oh, nothing. (still giggling)
What is this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesnt fit him).
(starting the Dust Buster) What smell?
Yeah, here.
All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?
Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.
Right.
It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.
Not now. She's right inside.
What are we gonna do?
The actress?
hi Elaine
Yes.
You did?
Tomorrow afternoon?
What do you mean, no?
I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.
Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.
Oh, hi. Soda?
Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?
What d'you call it?
Yikes. Well, good look with all that.
Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show.
oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this.
A preemptive breakup.
What was on the list?
I'm going.
It's almost a week.
Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?
Who you calling?
Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?
Hey, I just said it was stupid.
It's not a valet, it's a protg.
She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.
Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...
Why?
You're not gonna get the job.
Katherine Hepburn? Oh yeah.
Oh screw him! (George enters)
Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar!
What?
Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.
I think SHE saw it coming.
Darryl. He's black, isn't he?
Oh.
No. No, I can't!
He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!
You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while, no matter how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because they're crawling , crawling on your skin. Up your legs , up your spine , up your back.....
He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it.
The Drake is great!
Oh, good idea...
Why not?
So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.
You see -- ah, uh ...
No I hadn't noticed.
You're walkin' like Frankenstein!
I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.
That was brutal. I cant go back out there.
Not fair.
Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.
It's hard to say.
(Stopping him) No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!
I'm a good son.
Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years.
(to a woman) Hey, what's going on?
Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guys out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, its true, men hear a drill, its like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, Honey, I think Jims working on something over there. So they run over to the guy. Now they dont actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. Thats what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, What are you using, a Phillips-head? You know, we feel involved. Thats why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, thats just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they dont cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, thatll hold.
Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?
There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of... (he cracks) Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?!
Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.
Of course, they're polyester.
Mine!
Why? What happened?
Can I just get it opened first?
Ah, no thanks.
I got it! (snaps his fingers) We give the keys to Elaine.
She's nice.
It's a haaazy mystery.
But this is what you've always wanted.
Forget that. He's a ball player. MVP< 1979. I'm making wise cracks in some night club. This guy was in game six. They're a perfect match. They like go together. They're like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.
Hey, where you going?
Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things about you from George.
(under his breath) This is unbelievable.
Newman.
Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.
For a date?
You are not dumb. Don't say that..
But Kramer--
Well? Go ahead.
(fidgets like he has no room with George next to him)... Could you move over there?!
Yeah, yeah. Dont worry about it.
Corvelay!
They're Cuban cigar rollers.
And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.
So what are you going to do?
Boysenberry, Huckleberry ...
"Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old married couple--" *I told you that pear was washed*!
Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.
Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.
Really.
Yeah, the lobster'll scare him.
Yeah.
...he never heard of corduroy!
Ok.
That was double overtime.
Elaine its her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back.
Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?
(Adding, fake praise) Good one.
Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention, Elaine laughs) Maybe it's time you got a different hobby.
Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you.
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--
Right now.
New shirt?
Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didnt like the looks of the defense and changed the play.
Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I-I just wanted to ask you a question when we we're going out did you have orgasms?... Okay, thanks... No that's it... Ya, Okay, bye.
Scared the hell out of that guy.
Hey.
The captain of the toes. (phone rings) Hello.
Hi Elaine.
So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner?
I don't think you are.
Clever.
No. None.
Oh! (hitting George)
What?
Hello is this Alicia? .This is Jerry Seinfeld.
Yeah, that's him.
I didn't know he wasn't invited.
Yeah.
Of course she doesnt have five thousand dollars!
It was a scratch.
Who?
What calls?!
Hi Sue Ellen.
You've got a little rage.
No reason...
I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?
You're a shmoopy!
Hmm, So?
If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld.
You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters.
Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.
She's been in Mexico for six weeks.
Yeah.
No, No bomb.
I don't want you to call him.
There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?
(Blunt) I believe you.
"Hey! Hey! Watch it.!... You're drooling all over the floor. How much Novocaine did that guy give you."
AM/PM.
You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.
(trying to divert Vic's attention) What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that?
It's gotta have something to do with Kramer
I got a date with that girl, Lena.
I admit it. I don't watch it.
You got my spot?
Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for?
We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.
This is ridiculous.
'... downtown.'
Jerry.
You're kidding?
Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.
Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.
You want the tickets?
He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them
Yeah.
You want 'em back?
You're sure?
Hey. So, ah, Ramon this is my friend Elaine.
Oh, I cant believe it. Let me see that. (Jerry takes the paper.) Thats four and a half points in three days! Thats almost half my money!
I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!
You cant look in there, were playing!
Yeah. I want that coat. (Jerry opens his wallet, looking for the dry-cleaning ticket)
How would we do it?
Yes you would.
Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that.
Well, we barely knew the guy.
Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)
Skin cancer! Damn.
Latex? And what do I do with latex?
Thirteen thousand.
Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!
(Stops pulling on the pants) Alright, alright, That's no good. (Moves Kramer over to the couch) Let me try getting them from the bottom. (Goes for Kramer's Leg) Just gimme one leg.
How d'you know?
Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.
Yeah...
All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.
Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately.
Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards.
I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.
No, gore-tex. It's new. (Checks his pockets.) Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that.
...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either.
What are you doing here?
What about all your Jewish jokes?
Audrey?
My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?
I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.
That orange dress is burned in my memory
Wow. What are we celebrating?
Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.
What's he here for?
You're complaining about a private jet?
Oh, I got to see this thing.
Well I started to go under...
(takes the card from Elaine) We had a little fight this afternoon. (reading from card) Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe.
Uh-huh.
(Pointing off screen, nodding) THAT I heard.
Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. (They go out into the hallway and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.) Hey, how ya doin.'
It completely turned her off.
Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?
They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.
Sixty-six years old?
...But with punching and kicking.
(to the phone) Hello? (disappointed) Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) No. Uh, I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesnt know anything. Hes just my next-door neighbor. Uh, nothing much... Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. Im meeting somebody... Uh, Wednesday? Wednesdays okay... All right. Uh, Im a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning?... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone.
I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for him for a second.
Yeah.
Uh, next week.
I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.
Oh, Mattingly just singled .
Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in big, big trouble.
They're nobody.
'...down town.'
You didn't get my papers?
She seems very nice.
Dad, I'm sorry.
Yeah.
(neutral) No problem.
Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..
They could at least try it.
What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?
Gimme that thing!
So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?
I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life.
All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?
Sure, that would be great.
(to the phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)
Oh yeah, I know.
I know what you mean.
Horse manure?
All I know he was sniffing.
All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. She's at CALVIN KLEIN's right now.
No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.
Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.
Look at the size of his bird!
Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man.
Patti?
Oh. (notices a car being jacked up by a tow truck) Hey, isn't this Kramer's car? (yelling up) Hey, Cosmo!! They're towing your car!!
Hey, doesn't Newman have a Bruline racquet?
Well--
Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...
You really like this girl.
But...
No.
Get out of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The Heart Attack')
Raspberry, Strawberry ...
I dunno...
And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry)
Oh, that's gold, baby.
Alright.
Yes, Lupe. I'm blaming Lupe.
She doesnt wanna borrow the money.
Hey.
What are you doing?
I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. (Lena is puzzled.)
I usually like mine with an angioplasty.
Where's Simon?
Looks like a swan.
My show from last night.
Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.
Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah.
Where you going?
Really?
Have you ever spent any time with these people...?
Here, check that out.
Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.
(Thinking he's stopped Leo's thefts) Thank you.
Hey!
I don't know how long this is gonna last.
What are you doing?
Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do?
(coyly) Oh, nothing important.
Are you saying...
I'd be happy to.
It is a good idea, Elaine.
Hey! What is wrong with you?!
Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George "Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again."
He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris.
Hello?
Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.
Where are you going, what?s the rush?
Hey.
Could you at least get a hat for me?
You've really gone mental.
So she was just lying there.
We're gonna change the system.
Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.
I don't smell anything.
Bye shmoopy.
Oh! my god. What the hell is this? ..... Don't tell me.......Velvet!!!
Oh.
Huh?
Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.
No, I don't want to.
I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around..
I don't recall you drinking Caf Latte.
I can manage.
You're kidding.
Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you.
It's subtle.
Hey.
No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.
Oh, it was a lovely affair.
Hey.
Well, just get it down.
Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?
Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I?m the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me!
I think if ones going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. Its common courtesy. I dont know. Thats just the way I was brought up.
Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town.
(smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good.
How long has your car been sitting in the Yankee parking lot?
She could have.
Can't hear a thing.
Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?
hello.. Erika
No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.
I gave you a taste. What do you want?
Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh...
That was July 4th!
All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm away, gets phone) now... the failsafe. The wake-up guy... (dials)
But why?
You're not gettin' any skin, Kramer.
No, but I expect to hear anytime.
Home at last. Ahhhh. (light turns off)
Right there.
Really? Did you hear that? Somebody else was killed!
Hi.
Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I?
What?
Is not.
Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do?
Y-You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set!
(Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script?
Maybe!
I dont know.
Nah, he didn't make it.
New deal?
Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time.
Oh, that's lovely.
She's bald?
Youre in there again.
Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up)
(weary) Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out?
I know it is!
How did you lock your keys in the car?
I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?
Its good to see you.
I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!
I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?
It's only nine o clock.
Excuse me?
You faked with me?
Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.
I like sneakers.
I didn't do it!
Alright.
What for?
I once got Happy New Yeared in March.
Why don't you just throw 'em out?
(Trying to block out Kramer, he starts to sing along with the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus..
(zipping up his bag) Sometimes you do.
Hey, would you mind switching seats?
Hello?
Right.
Where you going?
You touched 'em?!
Lopper.
Hello there, how're you doing?
Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What drives me to take chances like that?
You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you... (catches himself)
Lemme see if I understand this. In other words, you held out
Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.
What is this?
Alright. (Elaine enters.)
Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.
She had a good time.
You see?!
Hello, Newman.
What are you bringing snowballs in here for?
The Bubble Boy? He lives around here?
Oh.
Holland *is* the Netherlands.
Yeah.
Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead.
Hey whatever happened to Moochie?
Probably the reason..
Why outside here?
He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. He's a time slot hit.
I would think.
You don't look well.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell.
All of a sudden he gets hungry.
(wiping his brow) He could use a couple laughs.
All this for a Chuckle.
Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order.
Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?
No!
Surprise! (he carries in the object)
Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.
I didnt even think to look.
Where do I know her?
Plane's ready.
Here we go...
Come on.
I don't want it.
I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?
Hey.
I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it.
How do you like that? (tries to turn away again; thinking)Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I cant, I cant. Im stuck.
That'd be great. There's no wrong answer.
Did you follow the recipe?
What do you mean not going? why not?
Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.
Yeah, there's some sickos out there.
Hey, how was the meeting?
I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.
Hello... Oh hello Elaine.
Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.
So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)
Well, what is with you?
Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!
Then who?
What stone?
(to Kramer) So how's your karate class going?
No! No pick!
Really? I thought...
I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.
Westchester? Isn't that a private club?
You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs.
That's the spirit. You suck!
You got a date with Becky Gelke?!
Sure, go ahead.
Good shake. Perfect shake. Single pump, not too hard, you know, doesn't have to prove anything, but, you know, firm enough to know he was there.
No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.
(Reading words George wrote on his hand) "Matthew, Luke, Paul", what youre cheating on your conversion chest?
I'm sorry. Got any booze? What's say you and I get ripped!
If not now, when?
I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.
No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1,900 dollars.
(Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!
So who's the new you?
They're not letting me in.
There's no Zorn or Zoutraph.
I don't mind the cemetery.
Mmmmmm!
Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?
People dont turn down money. Its what separates us from the animals.
I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.
Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar.
Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!
How did she get Lyme disease?
Madeline stays here.
It sounds like an excellent idea.
Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!
No, I had to tell my friends  my friends didnt have to tell you.
Gotta go. (heads out on stage)
What'd you think?
Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...(hugs Meryl.) I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!
What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!
Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set.
It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me.
He was in the shop. I thought you told me he wasn't going to be there.
Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.
(louder) Hey!!
Today, like right now.
182 bucks.
You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends....
Oh, no, uh, go ahead. You got a pen?
Marla?
Uh-huh.
Hey look, there's a spot right in front.
Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.
Youre a little paranormal
You cant go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.
Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here.
oh you're afraid he might look like Zippy the pinhead
Well...
Evelyn, this is Elaine.
Where are you going?
uh uh, we're uh ..
No, I haven't.
Yeah. (Kramer sits in the seat next to Jerry) Uh, uh, oh, oh, Over there. (points to the next seat over)
What are you gonna do?
(exasperated) Where do I find these guys?
What for?
You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?
" Yeah! What's that."
Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?
Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!
Head to toe?
Ok, I'll see you around the building.
(To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.
(to George) Was he out there?
(resumes) ...you know, make a good impression.
Maybe you're a little jealous.
(To George) Easy big fella.
Tunisia?
(louder) Bob!
Ohh.. look at this..
Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.
Yeah, well I don't trust this guy. I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.
Could you excuse us please?
She did kind of touch my face.
George, you're thinking too much.
So did I do a terrible thing?
(surprised) Alright.
It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ...
Oh, Im sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.
I don't know? Consomm or something.
First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.
What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp, why do you want shade?
He should have had a reverse peephole.
You know why? Because people like to say "salsa." "Excuse me, do you have salsa?" "We need more salsa." "Where is the salsa? No salsa?"
so the woman was walking around in a bra
Great! (realizing) What?
It's better than Dondi.
Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected, outwardly.
(after entering) The bedroom!
All right. (sits down)
One-Q? Whose apartment is that?
No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?
So you want to catch a movie later?
I guess they leave that up to the general population.
Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet.
But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.
Hi.
You are soo good lookin'.
Why, what's up?
(as George picks up a broken piece of his car) You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out...
I killed.
What happened with all the shirts?
Oh, it's not that bad!
Yeah, sounds like fun.
I think the thing I admire most about the Chinese is that they're hanging in there with the chopsticks. Because, if you think about it, you know, they've seen the fork... by now. I'm sure they've seen the spoon, they're going, "Yeah, yeah, they're OK... We're going to stay with the sticks." I mean, I don't know how they've missed it, thousands of years ago, Chinese farmer gets up, has his breakfast with the chopsticks, goes out and works all day in the field with a shovel... Hello?... Shovel! Not going out there ploughing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues.
Stolen? When?
Kramer's party.
It's Jerry.
Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.
Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people.
Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.
I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.
Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.
Seinfeld.
"Wait a second ..Where you wearing those shoes in the cab?"
Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure there are many people who do not like me.
Youre not
The pop-in.
Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)
She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love!
So, tell me anyway. Who was the BIG mastermind?
Good. (pause) Steak knife?
Nice.
Good thing the cleaning lady was there.
How you gonna get me up there?
Uncle Leo?!
The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.
Kramer.
We'll come to work with you.
So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night...
Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.
But?
Hi Uncle Leo.
Hello
When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.
Yeah all right.
(starts pulling them apart) Alright break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells)
So join in.
"Slow it down"?
Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?
But then I found out about the skin cancer.
Oh, yeah. Right.
Bye
How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!
You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal.
What are you, a medieval dungeon master?
No it isn't.
Come on up.
The driver seems a little put out.
(to Kramer) Hey (snaps fingers) get your stuff, let's get going.
By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks.
Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...
There's weather.
Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.
Yeah.
What did you wanna be?
What should I do? (to Alton) Uh, were taking a cab, arent we?
It was not!
Have a nice night.
That's right.
Oh, hi Brett.
(pulling Leo back in) Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you.
Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- Ill be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too.
(Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?
What?
Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent. It's very boring.
Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?
Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.
This is really too much.
Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway.
Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?
Your mother reads your mail?
What did you say?
I'm not married!
I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend.
"You know! Like a tennis shirt."
Oh please.
Babu?!
It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.
Back together?
Alright. Seems like...a strange choice.
How you feeling?
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.
I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table.
But you gotta know how to work the projector.
May I see you outside for a moment please?
No, they're old cards from my grandmother.
Come on up.
So?
Easy?
Of course.
Yeah, right.
Let's do it.
Well, well, well.
Cant you talk to your boss?
No good?
It's impossible
No one knows.
Hello? Is this 555-8383?
Ah, Lloyd.
Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than "coffee machine show."
It is so my business!
And you didnt even hear how she sounded.
What, what, what's wrong with you?
Hey, Susan, George.
Can you believe her?
What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.
Well, I have this neighbor...
She's out.
Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened.
Ahhh got my laundry back.
Standard. Micro.
Whats the difference?! Thats the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!
What do you mean? Why wouldn't I know his name?
Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?
But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.
Another time? What other time?
You shut up.
Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage from her yet!
Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something.
I just don't understand the raisinettes.
What!?
$875?
Hi, Elaine.
I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.
Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.
I don't know.
Yknow what? This is not that bad an idea.
(To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!
Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)
Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.
That's true.
You're nobody.
Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.
What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him, I dont think were right for each other. Hes a guy! At least with a woman, theres a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.
Why don't you go out? It's nice out.
Yeah.
A healthy person.
Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.
Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.
There's none left?
Well, maybe your refrigerator...
Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus.
Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!
Ma! Ma! MAAA! (Hangs up the phone in disgust.) Oh, ahhhh (sighs quietly)
I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?
Why didn't you shave this morning?
Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh
You mean like...Liza!
No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum...
I would like to propose a toast....Wait a second.. George! George Costanza come in here.
Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
(like a frustrated child) Why can't I know?
How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!
Right.
I have no idea.
What's this?
Yeah?
Yes, I would take her out.
thanks
Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*!
(on phone) Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act (pauses for response from Adrian) No new material (Elaine enters) He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week, it killed. (waves hello to Elaine; pauses for response from Adrian) Thank you, thanks fo.. you will not regret this. Ok, Bye. (hangs up phone; to Elaine) Hey.
Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?
Nah, I dont go for these non-refundable deals. I cant commit to a woman. Im not going to commit to an airline.
I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.
Yeah.
You might have.
Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!
These the people you currently live with?
Why'd you tell her?!
So what are you gonna do?
Yes I do.
Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a person could still make a mistake like that.
What? Whats cool?
(emphatic) I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!
So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you this thing was good!
I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.
He's somebody.
There's a lot of change down there.
Hmm.
Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?
Thus ends the great ball man experiment.
One more lane to go.
Why are you calling my parents?
Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin?
Yeah.
No, certainly not.
So? What are friends for?
Buddy?
An inch! Can you move over an inch?!?
So youre saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, its all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.
George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.
Bathroom uh, bathroom's uh right over there.
It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---
The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like youre always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. Youre out somewhere with people, Gee, you look pregnant.. are you? Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, thats not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Lets take this whole scene again. People, think about what youre saying!
You said this to her after.
But that's your routine.
Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--
I thought it was over there.
Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?
Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.
From that woman at NBC?
Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. (Faint) I don't care about that.
(pause) All right, sir.
(re-entering) Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again, are you?
Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.
Horses? Theyre like big riding dogs.
I don't understand this..
That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.
What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.
I know you will.
Uncle Leo.
Fancy meeting you here!
What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?
Oh my God, George!
So, who's gonna pull this thing?
I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.
You're going to the Super Bowl?
What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them.
Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?
So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?
Aah!
Come on up.
(irritated) Great.
(Handing her a small bottle) Here, drink this.
You can't even play.
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?
Come on! I know it's something you wanna do! (she pulls harder and he falls right off the table)
(Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here..
Is that the end of it?
Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thingreal bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though.
Oh friendship... friendship, shmanship .
So?
I'm not taking anyone's side.
Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.
Hey, board of directors. Look at you!
No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.
Hey, would you stop it already?
This is amazing, you can't believe this!
I don't even know what to say.
I'm gonna call her.
Well, he flinched, sort of.
I just got the most bizarre message from you father, Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!
Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.
(Confused) Where'd you get that one?
She's got greeting problems.
Ouch.
How do you feel?
You ever go to Camp Tiyoga?
Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa.
Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?
What was that pop sound?
Thanks.
Right.
(to the Drake) So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome... (to Elaine) They loved the TV, *loved* it!
Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.
Uh oh.
Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now?
What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?
And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
Really? It felt good.
(to the intercom) Elaine?
No, I think the head does most of the stretching.
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.
Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.
Can I have a piece of that?
But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.
We're doing sixty miles an hour!
Maybe I didnt want to talk to him.
Yeah,
Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our prices, we'll give you the store.
Oh, the beach.
Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?
I'm gonna go let Elaine in. (Kramer reaches out to stop him leaving)
(not as eager) Hi Joan.
Do the bums ever complain? "Soup again?"
Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.
Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it.?
(interrupts) What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today. (on the phone) Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we would do that. Okay. Great! Thanks a million! Okay, bye.
Yeah, how about a mute?
Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!
Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. Youve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?
Yeah!
So, do the Ross's know?
C'mon..
Oh.
Except the store's in Delaware.
Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.
Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
(To George) What's the matter?
Very good
Could you?
Can I just go up?
Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there.
Right, right. Okay. (Writing) Elaine enters.
Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.
Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.
You didn't look down?
(thinking) Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?
"Why are you taking this so personally?"
Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.
You're passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago!
Ah, the power lunch crowd.
What's around you?
Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there by two o'clock. We should take a cab.
(taking a catalog) Can I have one? I need one of those old-looking phones. So you wanna grab a bite?
I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.
You mean *a* career.
You're such...
That's how it's gonna be.
We're talkin' federal crime here.
Hi, is Sandy here?
Hey Mick.
Im always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice. Never quite sure, Is this the best lane for me? For my life? Theyre always a little bit ahead of you, Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there? Yeah, come on over here, pal. Were zoomin over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it. The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen? Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday well be going, (Jerry pretends hes driving in reverse.) Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. Im gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.
Great, you're lonely and miserable again. (presses button to call elevator)
It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.
Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?
Hello?
(Over his shoulder) Not me.
C'mon, will ya?
Right.
No, Uncomfortable? Not at all. (ASIDE TO ELAINE) My friend's wife's breast sticking out - why would that make me uncomfortable?
More cereal? that's your third bowl today, you had it for breakfast and lunch.
It's not like she's *in* the movie.
Yeah who?
Comedian.
Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!
I don't know how I feel about it.
Oh, she didn't mind?
We're not leaving the car!
The Inka-dink.. You were It.
Hi.
So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?
(pleased) I'll call George!
It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.
I got a 31 waist, mister!
So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on me.
Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches)
I don't know him. I know who he is.
No, no of course not.
Friday?
I know a little.
God, you're right.
Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.
Yeah?
He had to use cork-screw pasta.
He drove a car with no arms?
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?
It is kind of silly.
Fine...
Uh, bathroom.
What's that?
I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.
You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world "I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable." (George is baffled)
Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late.
(Frustrated, he reacts) Everybodys ripping me off!
You barbecuing tonight?
Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.
The guy whos in the gulag?!
I got a date with Nikki.
(firmly matter-of-fact) Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.
(resigned) At least it's show business..
So, we're givin' him nothing?
Hows he doing?
Why?
I think I've seen that look.
And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.
Yeah, yeah, take care of it. (Jerry throws her some toilet paper) Come on, George, what is it?
(Deeply sarcastic) No. You're never here.
And you were integral.
And you are it!
It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.
Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.
That's good.
Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
What's wrong with him?
How can you do this?
Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye. (hangs up the phone; turns to Kramer) You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.
Come back another time.
I'll take the first class.
Why?
Well you have to.
Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.
All fathers are intimidating. Theyre intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, To hell with the world, I can make my own people. Ill eat whatever I want, Ill wear whatever I want, and Ill create whoever I want.
What do you mean she liked you?
Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.
Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?
Well, I'm not telling you.
This woman's completely ignoring me.
Great!
Hello?
Give my best to Hinckley.
What?
Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions.
Yeah?
Is that your "chicken" making all that noise?
Yes, A...?
Yeah. Because she threw out my napkin.
Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...
This is my friend George.
Oh
I'll wait.
What?
You never know.
Oh, My god.
So Kramer, what are you going to do?
Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.
I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.
(picking up the phone and dialing) It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.
Beautiful!
Come on George.
Bless you.
...Guess so.
"We"? Since when are you a writer?
I am challenging.
You guys both have class at the same time?
I guess.
That's right, I'm taking a dive.
"No...Got dental appointment."
My mother's.
Yea.
I gotta get out of this cab...
Well, I'm very mysterious by nature. (Jerry knocks on the door) A lot of women find that attractive.
Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye.
Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.
I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?
Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?
(Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.
You could not like it.
I know the list...
Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.
Why doesn't she pay for hers?
(also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it.
Yeah, I know.
When you feel guilty.
Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine.
No.
Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?
'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.
I don't want to talk about it!
Yes!!!
Because you know we used to go out.
What are you talkin about? Its fine, I love having you here.
She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?
Yeah have a couple of pieces, weak, weak gum yeah
What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like it?
Ah, I think he's probably better off.
What song?
I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, "Oh This is so good. What's in it?" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not.
Yeah.
Good! Don't! Are these my keys?
Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!!
That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact.
(thinking) They've gotta be kidding.
"No ,Elaine and I we're just discussing whether I could admit a man is attractive."
Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.
It was just a couple of blocks.
Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend. (puts his arm around Elaine's shoulder, but she shrugs it off twice)
What ever happened to Darren?
Why?
Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...
I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something.
Yeah, one sec.
What are you all dressed up for?
Here. Two tickets. Have a good time.
With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.
I'm not here, leave a message.
You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.
... this is all .. very confusing.
Yeah, theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.
Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school.
(pause) Yeah, I guess.
It's a monkey, Kramer!
How did you know about that?
And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking?
Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of lobster)
That's very nice, I guess.
Oh, hi Valerie. What's up?
Oh.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh, you didnt...
Hey.
Well what am I going to tell Alex?
Oh, I was just looking for er, some... gum or... mint.
I don't wanna be a 32.
Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment.
Ah, you're out of your mind.
Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?
Oh Yeah we went way out and wild.
Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 630 and gimme a call.
Playing today?
Really? Since when?
You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand?
That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.
No, Katie, don't-- (He hangs up phone)
Elaine danced?
Yeah.
What, are you ordering food now?
Oh yeah, hold on.
Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that?
Call Rachel.
Hey! I heard the good news!
I had a statue!
Oh. It's in your eye now.
Boy shes sexy isnt she?
Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!
I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?
I *just* learned that. (proudly holding the Yo-Yo)
Oh, so there's still hope.
what?
Hey Doc, check this out. [does an around-the-world with the Yo-Yo]
Jack.
Yeah, uh, I'll see you later.
O.K.!
No, she's great! She's.. attractive, she's fun..
No chance.
Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. (Kramer picks up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.) Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! (Kramer starts filling a pot with water.) What are you doing with that?
Why?
Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!
Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?
So after the sucking, comes the weaning.
Yeah, sleeping arrangements. So, you haven't, uh...
Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...
Hello.
Yeah! it's all taken care of.
Dad I'm paying.
See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! Then come out with the regular!
No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.
Wow. Look at him. The Yankee Clipper
It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?
Oh, I know her. I know her type.
Ohh, you got the jacket back.
Why?
There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...
I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
Who's stopping you?
Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.
and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!
I can't go to sleep at nine o clock!
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!
Yes I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition...
Huh?
Now we have to buy a new couch?!
Get in the car! Get in the car!
All right.
Good idea.
(checking out George's textbook) Risk management?
How'd that happen?
Wow! What'd she say?
All right, all right. Im sorry.
Yeah. Nine oclock.
You want to get a bite?
Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there?
Well, just
(uncomfortably) Nothing.
Certainly are.
You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!
Oh, you know what?
A real human rights nut, huh?
(To his parents) So? What do you think?
I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel.
She's pretty. She's not beautiful.
That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it. (throws watch in garbage)
Too bad.
Whats so amazing? Youve seen him before.
What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it.
You dont know what it was.
What's wrong with lunch?
Like that (snaps his fingers)
Aagh! You come back for your clothes
Kramer, I want my car.
No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!
A marine biologist.
Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money?
All right. You know this girl Clare I am seeing?
(sarcastically) Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.
Why?
I always feel bad for the silver medal winner in the Olympics. How do you live with that the rest of your life? People are gonna keep asking, "- How much did you lose by? - I don't even know...! It was like...(very fast) now.now...now.now..now..was like, like... now..now..now...! It was it...! Eh, it was it and I lost. I trained, I worked out, I exercised, I did everything, I was doing push-ups, sit-ups, I never did anything but exercise and work out for 20 years, I flew half way around the world and aaaaaaaaaah!...(showing a tiny distance between his index and thumb) And that was...it was a photo-finish! Silver...(stretching his neck forward)...gold. If I had a pimple, I would've won.
I'll make them later. Uh.
So what are these?
He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.
Yeah, got it from the bank.
Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined.
I don't...I dunno.
Alright.
Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant?
Not a good sign.
No, "yada yada" is good. She's very succinct.
Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism.
I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.
He might want a show about anything and everything.
Didn't you see the sign on the door?
So, you're using Frank's relaxation method?
You got lobster for everybody?
So, Wilkinsons out of the hospital now?
Yeah
Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.
Birds?
Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??... Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women!
Are you O.K. in here?
(pointing) And there's David Steinberg.
I'm in the book and I have a machine.
Hey.
See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.
I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...
Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.
No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.
I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
I didn't think so.
No.
Yes , I got her number.
Oh.. I know who's cooking today!
You got yourself a girlfriend.
Well, yeah...sure.
Was it apple?
I've never done it before.
Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.
Newsletter?
Too bad. It was erotic.
Oh yeah, Steinbrenner...
Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.
(angry) Oh, you idiots!
Well, what happened?
No rush.
All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.
I don't know, but you look like you're happy.
Hello, Newman. What gives?
Sponge-worthy?
He's late already.
Relax, hes late. Hes always late. Its part of his M.O.
You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back.
I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.
You, you cant overdry.
I don't feel so good.
Svengali.
Hey! Wait up!
Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?
Okay, Newman, thanks a lot.
Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.
Don't you think she could tell?
(reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.
All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.
You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
So, how was it?
Hey!
I can't believe she threw out my napkin.
Why'd you do that?
everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah?
He was 96 years old.
I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.
What?
Yeah, so how's my money?
Good, good, good... What's goin' on?
Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?
Hey, where's Kramer?
As a mater of fact, he did.
Go outside and see if he's still there.
Why?
What was that?
A letter.
Well, good night [holds hand out and shakes hand]
All right. How 'bout this one let's say you're abducted by aliens.
What?
Boy, its a good thing we came.
What car?
Not since June 29, 1980.
Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions.
That's disgusting.
George...
(closing the door on him) Oh!
I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.
Right, Dana Folley.
You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?
But you know... not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me.
This friendship Its not working.
Yeah, me too...
Sure, Beth, these things happen. (Brief pause) So, have you told many.. people yet?
Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?
Your parents are crazy!
Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.
You know this...
Bye bye
Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --
Many times. You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet.
I got no problem with that.
(sound of gunfire) Pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, Pkeeew!
While you were in jail. So you're free.
You've had the apple pie?
I dunno sometimes...
Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's better than eating it.
Why?
Fleckman?
Ohh.
You want to trade me an undershirt?
I told you not to come.
I didn't know it was possible not to know that.
The rines are crossed?
What do you tip a wood guy?
Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--
I read.
Oh, my God.
Fred, do you know Elaine?
Well, what does that mean?
Excuse me?!
Don't push me.
When do you intend to do this?
What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?
No I...
So the picture worked. Amazing!
(To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?
You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.
And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus
Yeah, it's funny!
Hello?
Who, criminals?
So I take it he's spongeworthy?
Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly.
What if I didn't do it right?
Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)
Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.
Hi. How are you?
Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. (Newman considers the implications of this.)
(Nodding) Okay, one-fifty.
Yeah.
Got it.
It's been three days and he hasn't called.
He puts 'em on a dental chair.
But you know me!
Thanks, great party.
Never seen a picture of him?
I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket)
(cautiously) Who is it?
And yet he continues to live.
Of course. How are you?
Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!
You're not worried about that?
I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.
George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.
(jocular) You just bought your own dinner.
Why?
He was trying to lift the TV.
Hi. Is Phil here?
She couldn't make it.
I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care
Oh yeah, she's dating Bania.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.
Its very bad.
I can't believe I'm losing Pam!
Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal.
How highs it suppose to go?
It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes when someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within the gay community. They're probably discriminated against because of that, people say to them "Y'know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but I think think it's about time, y'know that you got in shape, tucked the shirt in and lost the wife". But if people are even going to assume that people that are neat are gay, maybe instead of doin' this, "Y'know I think Joe might be a little... [waves hand back and forth]", they should vacuum "Y'know I think Joe might be >vroom< [makes vacuuming motion]. Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little >vrooom<..."
They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
Keep your shirt on. I got it.
You're never gonna make it!
(suspicious) Really?
(giving up) Check.
Hey.
No economic reason for them to be here.
(exasperated) Ugh.
Elaine
So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...
(trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents.
(Skeptical) Ohhh yeah.. right.
It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.
She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.
Your boys should stay in their neighborhood.
That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.
How did you know they were defective?!
I wonder where Elaine is sitting? I really wanted you to meet her she's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend Tony
(uncomfortably) Yeah that's too bad.
We'll be outside
OK, fine. 'What do I have to do to put you in this van today?'
What happened to the muffin?
All right. Elaine.
(to himself) Hoh, that Milos. (to Patty) Well uh, what shall we do, uhm, care for a cup of coffee?
You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.
Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you.
Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?
But if you go back with me , then I'm not.
Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.
What're you gonna talk about?
Really...
What's wrong with yours?
(Mumbling out) Thank you, Bryant.
Alright, well what if we say...
Yes.
You?
Yeah, ya know Cain slew Able.
Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino.
Yes. That's what was so vexing.
I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.
George.
I'm asking Elaine to marry me.
I hear you're going out with David Putty.
What?
Ill have an egg white omelet.
Maybe.
Tell her. I wanna hear her reaction.
I'm telling you man, I'm losing it.
Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.
My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.
Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.
It's been years!
It's your fault!
This is a, Bob Cobb.
Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy. You don't have to mention the bubble boy? I know about the bubble boy. I'm aware of the bubble boy. Why do you keep reminding me about the bubble boy?
How could I what?
Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio.
What are you gonna get?
NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye.
Yeah.
Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch?
Well, it was sudden.
Are you okay?
What are <you> doing here?
How could they not fire you?
No, you wait for the movie!
Yeah..
Im sorry.
Hey.
Well, what happened?
(holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.
Oh, I'm the doofus?
She's right, George. Bottle-wipe is big.
(Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So we're on for later?
Alright, let's go.
Hey.
Thank you. (They continue walking)
Aaa. Well ... you want something to eat, don't you?
No Elaine he's normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York.
He knows?
(in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.
Oh, come on!
Named Suze?
You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.
Uh, again? (Limping towards the door) I'll be right there.
Kramer you're going to have to face her some time
Hey, what are ya up to?
Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.
Would you give him the TV back?
(interrupting) No no it's ok. (walking Rachel out) So we'll go see Schindler's List later right?
Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Just give me a little squeeze.
I've hardly been out to dinner with them.
Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him.
Morning.
(wistful) I don't know, I just see you guys together.
Of course.
Hey, hey.
Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
Kramer!
You did not tell me not to sell.
Yeah?
I really think the M&M should be you.
Elaine!
Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!
(agonised) Uugh! Ahh.
Oh, I see. So you can go, "Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!"
She thinks youre a guy that doesnt like coffee.
They really should mention that in the breakdown height, weight, goiter.
Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way.
I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!
No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.
Oh yeah? I dont believe youve seen... this.
I do a wash.
(animated) Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and you sold a Cadillac?!
Thank you.
So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was just wondering if there were houses there to rent.
What happened?
Hello? Oh, hi honey. (annoyed, weary) Yes, I told him. I'll get it. (George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry to argue with Meryl on the phone.) Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...
That's my walkman!
Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men.
What's the matter?
What do you mean?
Shouldn't a doctor do it?
What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What are you Peter Lorre?
I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?
Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday.
Okay. (closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self) Didn't come true.
How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it.
Youre you. Were having lunch with Art Corvelay.
So what happened after the movie?
(accusingly) Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.
Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.
Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?
He's gonna talk into her other ear.
That's what they get!
What's up?
Well?
You got a mickey source?
I understand (not really understanding, lol).
I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!
All right.
You're a baby!
I want the antidote, pimple popper!
Oh whatta hell is goin'on?!
(pointing) There's George!
I just wanted to say how sorry I was...
What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. (Hangs up)
Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!
You said that already.
W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.
So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.
Cops eating Milanos. What crazy town is this?
Is that Burt Reynolds?
Kramer?
I'll tell you what happened. We got married.
What?
I still don't have to go.
I guess I would.
No its
Just, look, just give the keys.
you napkin I'm dripping
George!
Hey, how ya doin?
Hi, sorry I'm late.
I don't know.
Then what?
For what?
I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.
Kramer, let's do this later.
(interrupts)like a shark fisherman with a bucket of (?) Ch....
No.
Why, you don't think it's a good job?
Come on, Go in, go in! [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again]
Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!
No, no.
Why can't you do this on your table?
I mean it's no big deal. You're still drivin'. You should have been watching the road.
Oh, I can take it.
I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.
Where you had, uh, wooden teeth.
Let me call him back... Hello? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.
What?
Try and stay calm.
(hangs up the phone) Yeah, I really needed that suit.
What?
Is this about me?
Not (with) that, no..
What are doing, you crying??
Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.
Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to rides alone.
(tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back) Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.
That is so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood horse?
You're not alone. I'm practically broke.
(Sarcastic) Thanks for the tip.
I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.
So, how hot did it get?
(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!
Hey.
What?
Don't worry. We won't forget!
Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.
What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says " Aw, I'll just have some coffee." There's no truth to that.
A-Ahahahahah. Who told you?
C'mon, out with it.
But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.
Mike thinks I'm a phony.
What is his stand...on abortion?
So why didn't you say no?
Well we saw you come in.
You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?
Really? They bought the butler character?
Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning...
Oh, no. Its not that I dont think you can. I know that you cant, and Im positive that you wont.
Very handsome.
(Opens the door) C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? (Starts jiggling his keys - as if he's calling out for a dog) Huh? C'mon! C'mon!
Uh, friend of a friend. And you?
Where's Babu?
Too late for that.
Why not?
He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?
Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer. It shows at least he's making an effort.
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.
Well women do it.
Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.
Hey, there's the soda guy.
Bye, Dad. Take it easy.
They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys.
Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.
I think Ill take out the garbage.
(explanation) He's new around here.
Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place.
(TO GEORGE) Hey George, you ever see one?
Yes, that's right.
"Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!"
What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again.
Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door behind him)
it's battle conditions
The omelet. Damn.
I think she meant me, but.
Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.
Why'd you sell your pants to Bania?
Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.
Hey.
It was life and death.
It has nothing to do with whose house it is.
Uh... great.
I don't know about defraying.
That doesn't sound right.
Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)
(On the phone) Nina, Hi. It's Jerry.
Well, then you're drivin' me wild.
I've seen her in your building.
I'm not sure, but I think she was nice. (takes a sip of water)
Mom, I'm not married.
Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay... is uh...
Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door)
When are ya gettin' out?
Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land.
Anyway Beth, you know i was thinking on my way over how when i was 9. I wanted these handball sneakers, they were all black but they came in adult sizes so you know i never got the sneakers. (Beth looks him confused)
Oh! Come om . He'll be over there for a half hour, he gets lost over there. C'mon so what is this about?
So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.
Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...
What?
Well, you've come a long way.
Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.
'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.'
Hmm..
Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.
Yes Mr. Bevilacqua.
Hey!
If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.
He was buying quite a load of chicken, almost for two people ...
Uh-huh.
Nodding off...
So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.
Oh hi Enzo.
Well, the games starting just about now.
why do you do that?
"Oh! where's Jennifer today?"
I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.
Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.
I know. He got the hit in game SIX. So, so then what happened?
Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph?
(Modest) Oh, thanks.
Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?
I don't know.
Oh! Is that the bald stuff?
No. Would you just get out?
No, never.
You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
Oh there's nothing to see.
George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.
Hi!
(Apologetically) Oh, I'm sorry. Maestro.
Oh what, you're upset?
My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you dont make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life.
They're not making higher roofs.
Tennis, anyone?
And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant? Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it in there by helicopter, you know keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. "We got the hair but I think we lost the Zest." ....rejects the transplant with organs. Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . Guy just standin' there and suddenly... ..Bink! ( motions hair flying out of his head)........lands in someone's frozen yogurt.
Well, they might hook us up again.
Ow! Sharp key.
Hiss!
You don't think she's attractive?
What?
What? What news?
Why what happened?
Pez?
Schumann. (George stops himself, frightened. Jerry looks around the lobby.) Where are they?
Yeah.
Okay. I wouldn't see it again.
Hey, have fun at the... family reunion. (George exits) So, what do you know about this Jack fellow?
No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.
She'll have a cup of coffee and a broiled chicken.
Fourteen years down the drain. (points and walks off -- to the bathroom)
You read during lunch?
Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.
Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer?
Kramer, do you realize what's going on here? Do you know why you're here?
Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. (pointing at the umbrellas) What've you got in a push-button mini.
What are you talkin' about?
You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.
What?
See you later.
I'm callin' Elaine. See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley.
I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y. (he spits it into the waste bin)
Come on, your parents have money.
Yeah, so Joey?s a great lover of the opera
So get this book on tape.
He was good in Man From Uncle.
Hi.
No.
You never really had the right comeback, anyway.
(pause) You're Donna Chang?
(sarcastically) Yeah, Levine. And Im Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.
Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.
Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?
'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?
Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.
Alright, thanks again.
It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.
And gum.
Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.
Oh, no.
Oh, I'm back, baby.
Poppie's
Hi Roy.
(locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.
Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth?
So then we went to dinner.
That's Step Ten?
Well, theyre three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.
I thought there were two outs.
Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.
Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.
Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Jerry hugs Kramer, then grabs him by the cheeks.) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think Im in the clear here. Elaines not moving in. I dont have to confront her. She has no idea I never wanted her to move in. Im golden!
Yes, a man gave you...?
Of course.
Uncle Leo!
So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought ... What a coincidence. We're just about to eat.
Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)
I don't.
Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.
What is it?
A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?
How many years of med school did you have?
Yeah, take it easy. (Leaves)
I used it up
I know, I know.
Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.
So you're never gonna have sex again?
Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.
You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner.
(to Leo) Uncle Leo.
Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...
(Showing difference) It's apples and oranges..
Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?
Not.
But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!
Excuse me. (Gets up and answers the door.) Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!
Ok!
Hey buddy. I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's like in there, all night long things are creaking and cracking. And that red light is burning my brain!
Oh, right.
I did.
What? What is it?
So what do you write, childrens books?
Hey I don't even want the pen now!
Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.
I was just flipping it, it's mine.
Well, the pickle breath is a good start.
He said that?
He swore me to secrecy.
He's the same!
No, that's midtown.
Oh hi Jack.
I didn't see anything.
What do you think?
And what's with people getting sick?
We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie.
I'll pass.
Whom I gonna tell?
(to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)
Shes right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, Im gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.
Yeah, Uncle Leo.
Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?
So, what's your first book?
I think he's black.
Uhh...
Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.
No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.
He's kind of tied up here.
Great, how about you?
Why not?
Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.
(Points at Elaine) And the indigent.
So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil
Yeah, I-I know...
But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
He stole back the rye?
Can't be done, huh?
Where do they ever go on vacation?
A velvet scrunchie!
Oh, okay.
Whatever.
...the food court is closed.
You get out of here!
Are those the same shoes as yesterday?
Into the patient, *literally*!
Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.
(to Kramer) What's this?
Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly.
(tucking in his shirt) Oh ya this is Rachel.
The one with the...(mumbles.)
You know, Schumann went mad from that.
(defensive) At least it was just the handle!
Oh God he saw me.
No I'm not...
(Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical..
Well, something happens.
Hello?
Yeah.
I'm Seinfeld!
Can you bring my mail then?
You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I give you 50 bucks.
Yeah. Okay then.
Martine?
Take what?
Yes!
(Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?
He was running from a bee. (Elaine laughs)
No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I wouldve said tonight.
(aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!
You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.
Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'?
Yeah.
oh I'm sorry I didn't get most of that.. isn't that Kramer over there?
And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.
What?
(into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!
Fourteen thousand.
The Daily Worker has personal ads?
Oh, you dig?
Great? Where do you get great?
No.
I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright, I'm dropping you off at work, right?
No. The police have no leads (sitting on the couch arm) and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.
(as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people.
You're wearing the chocolate shirt!
She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.
(Being frank) Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.
Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.
What blankets?
(Fast) Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me!
Suave! And it's non-fat!
Well, this is great.
.... (silence)
And what did she do?
Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit.
Yeah.
Why are you doing this?
It's a very complicated area.
George.
Yeah.
It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was "Beaches" for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?
Hmm. Not bad.
Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person.
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!
Hey, I've been back four days, I want my mail.
No.
So, I guess you dont find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?
You spent the night at James's? Did we?
(rising) I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the speed-dial.
(From outside the apartment) Hello?
What, your sad little horsies, the house with the little curl of smoke, the sunflower with the smiley face. the transparent cube... (as she leaves)
Wow, what happened?
So you lie! What did you tell her?
What is it?
Can't see on your right side?
Yeah. (thinking) That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. (decisive) I'm gonna do it.
I believe we're not...
It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.
It's Sunday.
No, I just want some change.
Well, I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.
Holy cow! look at that!
Uh-oh.
(getting worked up) I don't need the money.
So Miranda's cooled on ya?
(to Helen) What about him?
Crazy kids, huh?
How was it?
And it's about nothing?
You what?
Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.
What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I
I think thats the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!
Really? Its over?
Oh, help me, Rhonda.
(simultaneous) Hey!/That's wonderful!/We got a deal!
Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!
No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?
He'll like you more...
What are you eating?
What?
What are you, crazy?!
He said wuss?
I was listening!
Something on your mind?
Sure you can. Why not?
No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. Maybe we should ask him.
She's into it?
Don't you need a little... help?
And the guy never knows?
You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?
I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation. The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?"
(from the back of the club, leaving) That's it I'm calling in the big guns.
You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.
Yeah, so am I being funny now?
Oh, Kramer, I -
There's a g-spot.
Ok. (Kramer goes back to his apartment.)
Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.
Yeah. Where's George?
I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.
It's not even my car, it's a rental.
Ohhh... You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.
Ya.
What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. (acts like he did in the movie) Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. (does the next look) I mean, beyond that, Im risking a punch in the mouth. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?
So what?
But an 85?
Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. "I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa " Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... (Naomi exits) it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality.
Hello, Susan? It's Jerry.
All right.
You're the best.
Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you.
(to Morty) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street!
Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.
Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.
Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.
Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.)
So you just did the opposite of everything?
Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually do it)
Hi.
Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.
Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?
Yes we will.
No I can't I've got some stuff to do then I've got to meet Keith at my apartment at three. I'm helping him move.
Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.
Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.
What are you doing here?
I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
No don't do this. You're not doing this. I will fight you. No you don't... No.
Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy.
Oh my god. Look at this.
No.
Poor son of a bitch.
Right by her?
C'mon. (They exit.)
He's the Got-no-Green Lantern.
Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.
You just asked me two minutes ago.
Sorry, sorry I'm late.
Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.
Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.
You are.
Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again.
What did you do?
Where are you going, you just got here?
I don't know.
Don't get up, please, allow me.
Well that's all I got.
No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.
Why didn't you ever mention this?
What?
Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting a package.
You told Nana to drop dead?!
Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
Good. How tall is she?
Yeah, right.
When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.
Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we play one for all the marbles?
(To Guard) I just wanted you to scare him.
Yeah pluggin' along.
Remember Peter?
Is he okay?
He's a little off the wall.
An assembly?
Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. (Hands over Kramer's quilt.)
You bought it for six!
Really? What happened?
(answering) Hello?
Well ... ok, I guess (voice trailing off)
Well, once I didnt have dinner until, like 900 oclock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage  meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya? Throw out my garbage for me.
Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.
I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.
You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.
(Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!
Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've never heard anything like this in my life. Listen to this.
Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (Jerry smiles. George laughs.) So, how's the book coming? (George's laughs taper off...) I say, how's the book comin'?
(writing) Here's my address and number. And really, thanks again.
I'm going to the hospital to see Fulton. I'm not even saying hello, I'm going right into material.
That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?
I know it's a big problem.. she puts like four pieces in her mouth, it's ridiculous, I don't think we're gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.
What is with this thing.
Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it.
You walk around with no underwear?
Well, whaddaya wanna do here?
I thought youd be upset.
Have you said anything to her?
What?
Perpetuation of the species.
What? I'm not looking. Nothing.
(suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.
I told you when I met her.
Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes.
Dont worry about it, it wasnt working anyway.
Pardon?
I never told you his name.
What do you need me for?
(humouring him) That's very nice.
So, go get them.
Well, I guess I gotta go, too.
I don't know. Blind date?
You got a little problem.
The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.
Oh, go read a book.
No deal. Not hot.
Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
But....
(Talking to Elaine) You ate more bread?
Really, you're getting that good?
Hey Georgie!
All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now.
Wow
Well, nobody sees the... cover.
(unimpressed) I, really can't say.
Was I supposed to bring something?
I can't believe your a friend of mine.
You dont think it mightve had anything to do with that?
What giant freak-head?
That's the way they do it in Vegas.
I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race.
Must I?
(Resisting) Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I-I can't wear this!
Kramer, you know, I--
Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me.
I did not cheat.
Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.
Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by the big showcase tonight.
(looking outside) Hey Newman, is that your red car?
So as he's telling the story he starts crying.
It has nothing to do with her sister.
That guy! (Pointing at George) Swarm! Swarm!
Meat? I dont, I dont know, go... hunt! (Kessler opens the refrigerator and sticks his head in.) Well what happened in the game anyway?
See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. (Elaine laughs.) All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free.
I only have a twenty.
Let's get out of here.
So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?
You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me. He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back.. I'm putting this guy ....RIGHT OUT OF COMMISSION....
Newer magazines.
Karma Kramer?
(raising hand) Faked 'em all.
...Yeah.
Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?
Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.
I want that picture.
She wouldn't so much as taste it.
Oh yeah. He's good. You know he's John Ritter's cousin.
(he hits a few keys and looks over at her) Cash advance... yes (hits a key)  no (he looks over again) balance inquiry... no (he looks again) receipt.... no (he looks again) processing... processing... (He opens the box, pulls out his money and then looks at the woman and says) I won!
Jenna's like me. She's very... (searches for word)
Elaine, he's a.. he's a male bimbo, he's a mimbo
It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.
In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.
You told him you knew Simons?
Not the gown again.
The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.
All right.
Well you might as well look it over.
George used up all my guest passes already.
The hospital?
What?
(derisively at Kramer) Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?
Listen buddy,
Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.)
Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.
That doesn't make it right.
Dad!
Really, stopping short. That's a good move.
(Pointing) I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.
What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I dont even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. Thats what I want. I want an admission of guilt.
I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.
Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?
(answering the phone) Hello.
What's the difference?
Yes, Jugdish.
"Finders fee"? It was on the lot!
Inka-dink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink.
(reading) 'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie, hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'
I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.
How much was under there?
Well, um same bed ...
I said I couldnt believe you liked that commercial. So what?
Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!
Come on up . (looks at his watch) ...What's he doing here now?
(Sympathetically) She coming of a bad break-up?
Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?
Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test.
Look at this, my ankle's all bitten up.
Yeah.
It's just...
It's a must lie situation.
Hmm.
Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
Are we finished?
You are the Queen of Confrontation. Youre my new hero. In fact, youve inspired me. Im gonna call George about something right now.
Hello.
I'm not joking!
You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?
We had that babka.
Well, one of the gypsies took it.
Well what do girls do ?
Seeya.
No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?
I know.
Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler.
So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?
Hi how are ya?
I gave your ticket to Horneck.
I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?
No, we have time.
Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. (And to George) What do you mean you can't tell me?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want.
Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.
All right. You're in MY face.
What is that noise?
Actually, yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!
We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident.
Leo?
Beautiful!
Hey, Elaine.
That's a lot of skin.
Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.
I don't want to.
(proud of himself) Remember me? I said I 'd come back with someone and I did. Surprised?.
What about little Joey?
Right.
(Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.
So what do you have to say for yourself?
Not as long.
What mustard stain?
What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.
Wow. That really is nothing.
(smiling and excited) Well, here we are.
You ran over some pigeons? How many?
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
Whats the rent?
Come on, you gotta let us in
I thought it sounded kind of cool.
Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad.
Definitely.
(under breath) Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..
Yeah.
So, um, do you date uh immature men?
Yeah, only for a while.
I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?
Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- Zip, I'm gone. (makes a running motion with both arms and his right foot)
Turn around, George.
Can I speak with this Bookman?
Absolutely. I have no confidence in you.
That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!
You've made some Fine Exits.
Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.
Everybody's moving to Seattle.
All right.
Yeah.
Wow! So...?
Uh, Huh, yeah.
(incredulous) You're making your own cigars now?
(turning to each other) I dont know. Hes an importer.
Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - theyre doing sign language now.
I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are gonna be so sorry!
That's it?
All right, go, it's a race! Come on!
(checking his watch) I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
(answering machine) Leave a message. I'll call you back. Thanks.
I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!
Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there.
What are you looking for?
Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.
What a family!
Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?
Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I, guess she passed out!
Susan! What are you doing here?
Ok.
(throws out his hands) What does he listen to? The all Desperado station?
I don't know.
No, let's survey first. Camp here.
Yeah. (hands racquet to Kramer) I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it.
Yes, they do!
Sure.
I don't know.
Definitely?
Excuse me, what?
Hola.
Tim Whatley?
I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.
hey you know it's weird because that voice sounded a little familiar to me
Elaine?
It's like Im talking to my Aunt Sylvia here.
Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.
(unenthusiastic) Uhh, I don't think so.
That's their policy.
I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need "the clown" in his title, as clown? Bozo, "the" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...
Of course not, if I did would you have gone?
Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on.
(To Kramer) Thank you.
Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.
Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.
Well, he cant kill me, right?
Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?
You really used to have a think full head of hair.
You want to spend the rest of your life with her
Well. (calling down the hall) Call if you're gonna be late!
That's not funny Naomi.
I'll just call her when you leave!
Well you're not Lois Lane.
Oh, that adopt-a-highway thing.
Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them.
But is this an emergency?
to himself Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.
It's brown.
Oh right, the new job, how is it?
Oh yeah, well why don?t you Just get lost.
Kramer you don't under the conversion rate.
I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.
What is he like?
What?
Actually, that is not a bad idea.
You're right there.
So I finally get to meet your pal Joey.
Ready?
He is the gambler.
I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune.
(to Elaine) So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?
All right, sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) George?
Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.
What's she like?
I guess Im coming. I mean...
I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no.
Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater)
All taken care of.
Come in.
Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.
Oh, you didn't see it.
This is not a good time.
George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments.
You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. Hmmm. What do you want?
Boy, those capes are really coming back.
I would know if I had a blender.
You're going like this?
(uncertain) Don't you hire people to do that?
I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've been so helpful.
HUGE pop-in guy!
I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the plot. It's embarrassing. It's an embarrassment to have to admit, but I'm the one that you see in the parking lot after the movie talking with his friends, going, "Oh, you mean that was the same guy from the <beginning>... Ohhhhhhhhhh..." Nobody will explain it to you. When you're in the theater, you can't find out. [whispering to imaginary friends seated around him] "Why did they kill that guy?... Why did they kill him?... Who was that guy? What was the... I thought he was with them? Wasn't he with them? Why would they kill him if he was with them? Oh, he wasn't *really* with them.... I thought he was with them. It's a good thing they killed him.''
Line two?
(Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat.
Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. (Kramer goes to get the suit. Elaine enters.)
So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new guy, in a big pot of love stew.
Yeah. So do I.
Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.
Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.
I don't know. Maybe.
Ah, separate knob.
(quiet) Huh. Alright.
But I'm not a disturbance!
A virgin.
Why shouldn't I go here?
