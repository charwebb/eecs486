I cant believe Im gonna do this. (Jerry opens the door and exits the dressing room. He walks over to Bania)
Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.
I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)
Yeah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.
This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
Fluff and Fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.
Come on, Go in, go in! [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again]
I think I may have made a big mistake.
There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair, striped shirt?
(through gritted teeth) Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.
Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?
I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?
Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!
Course you know there is always the possibility, that she called an audible.
Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.
(quiet) Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..
Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine?
It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.
I said pull over by the stop sign.
Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.
Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car so I don't toss it in that dumpster?
You must have quite a time down there.
Well you might as well look it over.
Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.
And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!
Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet?
Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and find my number.
(pointing to Kramer's hair) You got some suds over here.
You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.
Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.
Well you've really built yourself up into something.
You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.
You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.
"They get all emotional , they sway. It's embarrassing."
(sarcasm) Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.
Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?
Well it's been quite a night I could sure use a cup of coffee.
He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication.
Latex? And what do I do with latex?
(Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?
The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.
(Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.
Oh, yes. Particularly if youre not in it.
Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane enters)
Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.
(CONT'D) You want me to help you with that?
Well, I got to talk her out of this.
And who were you tryin to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?
(locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.
Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes outside)
Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?
Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?
No, believe me it's not good. I'll mail you a new one with something really funny written on it.
Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.
Fourteen years down the drain. (points and walks off -- to the bathroom)
(tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggage, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangements, but we can't seem to be friends when we sleep together.
(to Elaine) Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?
Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.
I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.
I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
Turn up the heat in your apartment! (opens a window)
Who do I know who would have even been in a limousine yesterday anyway. Uhh-O h-owow!
It's alright, I want you to have it.
He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. "I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"
She might be. She's the star of the show.
No, It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago . she's trying to become an actress.
I dont know how Im going to tell him.
But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.
You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.
Course you may not see it for twenty years.
That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?
Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it is. (vehement) Just take it!
It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.
Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?
I think that's a "what's good for the goose is good for the gander".
Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?
I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?
Happy camper , I don't hear that expression enough.
Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.
Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs.
I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? There's no grace period.
You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?
Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a little. .
Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money.
Dont do the apples. Its enough already with the apples.
I cant believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.
No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.
I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?
Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?
Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!
Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.
Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?
Well, we gotta get it washed (pulls off a few flyers)....Ah, the keys are locked inside!
Oh, like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping carts with one bad wheel?
So you go in the bathroom at eleven your in bed by what, two?
Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'
Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
(fetching a drink from the fridge) Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.
(pulling on a jacket) They had a cancellation and they instantly called me.
Well you're not even a fan. I was at game six - you didn't even watch it.
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little...
In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?
You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.
Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on.
They really should mention that in the breakdown height, weight, goiter.
You want to go with me to NBC?
Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--
My moms down in Florida. Shes got uh one of those condos. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?
(taking the envelope) Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em.
Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye. (hangs up the phone; turns to Kramer) You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.
(very disinterested) Hum... ok, what else you got?
The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..
(after Bookman exits) That is one tough monkey! (turns to Elaine) So you were saying?
Golden Boys always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry. Here... touch Golden Boy!
Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?
I'll see you tonight. (he's opening his door apartment as Kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe)
The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?
Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.
I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for him for a second.
Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?
Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction.
Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.
Oh, great! Alright. (We hear the announcers calling the game.)
He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.
I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high.
I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.
Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that?
Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.
Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.
You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events.
The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what youre doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? We have soda, we have soda, we have soda, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. Its a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and youre watching TV and youre drinking the exact same product that theyre advertising right there on TV, and its like, you know, theyre spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and Im standing there, Maybe Im putting too much ice in mine.
I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation. The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?"
Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I dont feel comfortable in them.
I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
(Trying to read the note) What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit.
Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.
(standing in the bathtub) Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.
This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy.
I guess they leave that up to the general population.
Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.
(to Kramer) Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot.
Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?
Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll uh try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. (Goes into his room, and comes back out with the jacket on.) Ahh, haven't worn this one in a long time.
Look, its a very awkward situation. I dont wanna be presumptuous.
Hey you know George isn't to happy, ahh, about your new friendship.
I dont know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three oclock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someones door and tell them to keep it down? Youre really altering your whole self-image. I mean, what am I, Fred Mertz now? Whats happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. Theres a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh... shh... shhh... shhh... Doesnt work, cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me. Some people you cant shush in a movie theater. Theres always that certain group of people, isnt it? Theyre talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They wont shush. Theyre the unshushables.
Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've never heard anything like this in my life. Listen to this.
(Nervous laughter) Yeah.. like a pirate.. (Attempting to get on another subject) Anyway, ah, you know, we're hoping to, um, raise enough money.. with this.. uh..
Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. Its completely shrunk. Theres absolutely no way I can wear it.
Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here.
I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.
She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.
Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.
(Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!
Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.
That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!
Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model.
Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.
I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck.
Someone says, Get out of my life, and that doesnt affect your appetite?
The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.
Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?
I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?
Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!
Let me call him back... Hello? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.
No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?
Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person -
The crook has the machine. The messages arent for him. Hes the crook. Why would he answer- (Jerry gives up on the explanation and turns around to see George standing behind him.) How did you get in here?
I mean all that stuff is so small.. ((ELAINE is wryly assessing him)) stupid..
People are going to steal from you. You cant stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker, whos gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They cant get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.
(Opens the door) C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? (Starts jiggling his keys - as if he's calling out for a dog) Huh? C'mon! C'mon!
Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.
No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me. She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised what's going on.
You know, instead, Im like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.
Now, there's a career path you may have overlooked.
(Scolding) George. (To salesman) Sorry, were just waiting for David Puddy.
Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.)
I don't even know what you're talking about.
Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.
My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!
She wanted to thank us for the apartment.
I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?
I dont get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?
How can you talk to someone like that?
You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.
When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion.
Yeah... hes specializing in whales. He's working on lowering the cholesterol level, in whales all that blubber -- quite unhealthy. You know its the largest mammal on earth but as George says "they don't have to be."
Well, we fight a lot for some reason.
(Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?
Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back
I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.
Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?
You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!
Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one.
Oh, I see. So you can go, "Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!"
I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
Well, well, look at you. It?s a little skimpy there isn't it?
You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!
You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?
(still in tuxedo, tie undone) Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.
No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)
(nodding awkwardly for a moment) All right, I think we're done here. (Jerry leaves and Phil shuts the door darkly)
Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? That's like half a pound of turkey!
(barring the way) I'm sorry. I-I don't know you.
... I think. Have some more wine. (Jerry pours his whole glass of wine into her glass.)
Look, let me just give you the forty, plus another twenty for your trouble.
No, I told you I admire your hearing.
Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.
Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.
(examining the label) Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.
Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)
(indicates with his thumb) Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.
Good luck, It's sold out for the next three weeks.
Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.
Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.
Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!
I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.
(applying paste to brush) Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?
Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?
All right now you listen and you listen good! (he grabs Kramer's legs and throws him down the couch)
(Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.
So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth? (Elaine laughs silently)
All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the bottle of fungicide.)
George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality.
I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?
Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.
Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend.
Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. (To Kramer) I never should have cashed those checks!
I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!
That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his fathers band. Hed loan it to you.
George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?
I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?
Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up)
Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...
(To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.
Yeah, well, I didnt- Is that something you want to borrow?
(Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.
That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
Who wouldn't like him? I like him. And I'm a guy.
Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you.
(To himself) I don't believe this! (Walks over to a security guard) Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with shoplifting..
Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.
Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?
How could you eat fish on a plane?
Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. (George gives Elaine a look while Jerrys back is turned. Jerry turns around.) I saw that.
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal, (steer).
Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)
Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery.
Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)
..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.
Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?
I thought you were gonna watch a video.
Listen, Joel, I dont think we should see each other anymore.
Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine.
I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.
No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are gonna be so sorry!
We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy.
Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.
Hey, is that my maple syrup? Oh, ya. (Kramer hands it over.)
Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?
Ohh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands. So.. (Goes for his coat)
I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.
Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.
Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)
You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.
Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before.
Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?
What, do you think I care about the money? Is that what you think? You want me to show you what I care about money? Here look, here look at this, here's a dollar here look, there, that?s how much I care about money.
(Shouting) Come on up! (Opens his door for Elaine)
Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.
Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.
What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!
That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?
Could you excuse me one second? Im sorry.
Yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder)
Okay... but theres no cake or anything, if thats what youre looking for.
I hear you're going out with David Putty.
Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?
I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you?
What, your sad little horsies, the house with the little curl of smoke, the sunflower with the smiley face. the transparent cube... (as she leaves)
Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.
C'mon up. (To George) Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'
Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up) Since I said what?
I asked. Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian football.
Elaine? How did you rope her into this?
And where does it end? Then everyones doin it. Its like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, "Dont go there." - Someones gotta take a stand!
Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation.
We don't hear that. (They enter the elevator)
Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.
Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters)
Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania)
She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
(as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.
Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something.
Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear?
(Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do?
(looking at the cop) What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think he's getting coffee.!
Is that your "chicken" making all that noise?
Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.
(thinks) Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize?
Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. (Newman considers the implications of this.)
Im meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.
Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.
Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo.
Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?
Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one.
George, this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on. (Jerry leaves.)
You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.
Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?
(to George) Snow. Snow, that cant be good for suede, can it?
Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.
Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.
Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.
Great, I had fun. Wheres the TV, wheres the VCR?
I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.
It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.
Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!
Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.
Would you turn that down! What is that crap!
I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...
The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.
Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.
Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
I'm gonna go let Elaine in. (Kramer reaches out to stop him leaving)
Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.
Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves)
Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?
You know, I really need to use the bathroom.
Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up?
George? (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.
Yeah, let me just stop by the cash machine and I'll meet you over at the coffee shop.
I cant. Shell get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.
Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
(disoriented) How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?
By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.
I can't go to sleep at nine o clock!
You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this jockey and the jockey got off the horse and started chasin' him.
So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.
Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.
All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.
(Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.
That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.
There's no watch ... I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep good time. My parents gave it to me, but I didn't like it. So don't mention it again, okay!
(trying to ease the tension) Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends.
Yeah, thats good. Hed clunk our heads together like Moe.
Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?
Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?
You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.
See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.
But the question is, are you still master of your domain?
Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here.
Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?
You dont think it mightve had anything to do with that?
We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, hey maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!?
He can't just throw me off the plane!
I'm NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT! ..
(taking a catalog) Can I have one? I need one of those old-looking phones. So you wanna grab a bite?
We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.
Uh, yeah. (broaching a subject) Hey uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to a meeting.
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why dont you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin anything?
Oh my God is that the new perfume?
(looking after the guys) That nut is always up to something.
I always feel bad for the silver medal winner in the Olympics. How do you live with that the rest of your life? People are gonna keep asking, "- How much did you lose by? - I don't even know...! It was like...(very fast) now.now...now.now..now..was like, like... now..now..now...! It was it...! Eh, it was it and I lost. I trained, I worked out, I exercised, I did everything, I was doing push-ups, sit-ups, I never did anything but exercise and work out for 20 years, I flew half way around the world and aaaaaaaaaah!...(showing a tiny distance between his index and thumb) And that was...it was a photo-finish! Silver...(stretching his neck forward)...gold. If I had a pimple, I would've won.
I don't even think you could do it.
The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal.
Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.
Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!
You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper!
You what? You passed? How could you do that?
It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.
Jim Fowler? The animal guy from "Wild Kingdom" is coming to your apartment?
I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?
I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.
I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.
Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.
All right, so I had wooden teeth, so what?
But then we would have missed the whole thing.
Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?
Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--
Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry pushes his door against Kramer's entrance]
I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.
Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.
I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.
Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?
You asked a date to go to the operation?
(turning to Kramer) That's nice for the freaks.
Im going out. (he comes out of the dressing room, while Kramer remains inside)
I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes.
Oh. No. What, you mean because of the "Chang"?
Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll never get another date with her. She'll freak out.
I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?
Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?
Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.
Wouldnt it be great if you could ask a woman what shes thinking?
So what about the "Maestro" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.
Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' "Where's your jock strap?" Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.
No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.
I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them are doing her dance as they go)
You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding.
Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.
I'm not talking about upside down. (Jean-Paul and Kramer come in) I'm talking about waking him up!
There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.
You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.
Hi. Hi. Look, I don't know what you think --
What causes homophobia? What is it, that makes a heterosexual man, worry? I think it's because, men know, that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, "Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'"
(to Kramer) Hey (snaps fingers) get your stuff, let's get going.
I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing.
(Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!
I wonder where Elaine is sitting? I really wanted you to meet her she's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend Tony
(to Morty) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street!
Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?
So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.
Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I-I just wanted to ask you a question when we we're going out did you have orgasms?... Okay, thanks... No that's it... Ya, Okay, bye.
Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. I'm being audited.
Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks.
Well, theres this uh, woman might be comin in.
There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.
I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.
So lemme get this straight you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an clair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, "What the hell, I'll just eat some trash."
Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.
Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!
Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And Ill need that in the form of a question.
You unwittingly made a major commitment. That's a lot of pressure.
Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!
I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.
(taking out his wallet and handing over bills grudgingly) Fifty dollars.
Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.
She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults. Things you would know very little about.
Yeah, so do you. (George enters with a newspaper.)
Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?
(in a hurry) Yea you're leaving at three o'clock.
Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)
I thought you were going out with Celia?
So what's going on with Simon? Did he leave?
It's not one of those 976 calls, is it?
(hitting metal with the first strike of the shovel) Well, that was easy.
Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.
I mean that's fine if that's who you are...
Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?
No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.
Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.
What, What is this? What is she doing here?
Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!
(to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)
I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
Don't you ever talk about her like that!
(pause, to Donna) You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name...
I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.
No, no, no, it's... "She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her."
(Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the 80s, and its still relatable today.
(exasperation) You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents.
I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y. (he spits it into the waste bin)
All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter)
Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test?
Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, (has his one hand up and his other hand down) he was down. Now he's up, (switches the positioning of his hands) you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.
That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I got.
Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.
(Sarcastic) Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.
And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.
This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.
No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.
A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little decision.
There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.
(trying to divert Vic's attention) What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that?
Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do some TV spots for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store. That was Leapin' Larry himself, I'm gonna meet with him tomorrow.
Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?
There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
(Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.
See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
What would you say if I told you that...
(To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.
(as George picks up a broken piece of his car) You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out...
What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?
Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery.
I'm right here. (note he has an athletic bandage on his right hand) You're late.
Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?
What's going on? You're the man of the hour, That's what's going on.
Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore...
Look Ramon, about the other day. Im sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway.
(Singing) Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!
Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.
What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?
First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did.
It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.
I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.
What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?
Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?
Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?
You got a little shmootz there (picks something on her sweater)
"Guys And Dolls"? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?
Well, thats a lot of money. But, if thats the way its gotta be, thats the way its gotta be.
Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!
(sarcastically) Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.
You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about the Costanzas'
Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?
I think I saw one a coupla doors down.
Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of lobster)
well aside from that from that, how did he like the sandwiches?
My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin' "where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?"
(to Bania) Excuse me. (he goes back in the dressing room)
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.
Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine.
Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...
So you want to go to the party on Friday night?
(on phone) Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil.
You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.
You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store.
Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?
So what do you have to say for yourself?
You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem.
Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it?
No, Elaines got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and hes suppose to do it.
And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.
And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.
yeah yeah what is it with you and Tony? what are you? it's like his sidekick now?
Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.
So you were with him that day at the track?
Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?
Well don't get too comfortable. As soon as Seth gets a real job you two are gong back in that chicken supernova.
And you want to be my latex salesman.
Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Jerry hugs Kramer, then grabs him by the cheeks.) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think Im in the clear here. Elaines not moving in. I dont have to confront her. She has no idea I never wanted her to move in. Im golden!
Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.
Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.
Flinched? I did not flinch. George, did I flinch?
Hey, what happened to your coat? And what is the smell? Is-ya, What are you drunk?
Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.
Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses.
That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The Mohel circumcised my finger!
You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?
Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.
Well, it couldnt be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?
I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine!
You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder?
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?
Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?
I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood.
Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!
Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.
Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse.
Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?
I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?
(uncertain) Don't you hire people to do that?
Elaine, he's a.. he's a male bimbo, he's a mimbo
I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.
(like a frustrated child) Why can't I know?
All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now.
Who would order a license plate that says "Assman"?
U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you?
He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, that were manufactured in Korea.
But thats what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. Theyre knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus.
Yeah. (thinking) That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. (decisive) I'm gonna do it.
What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't respect salad eaters.
They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
(Handing her a small bottle) Here, drink this.
That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen -
She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.
All right Newman, one more peep outta you, you're out of the whole operation!
Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. Youve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?
OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you know you are always welcome in my home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story.
Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.
Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.
So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, "Jerry"? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They're putting it on the air! They're giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California!
I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.
And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya?
No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver.
I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go "Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!"
No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing.
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.
... as long as one of them is not him.
I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?
I really think the M&M should be you.
Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here (points to kitchen), here (points to living room), or here (makes similar circle with his hands).
(Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.
Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.
It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.
Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?
Oh, man, look at this mess! You know what's gonna happen if they see this?
What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present)
You know I went out once with a nude model. Never let me see her naked. Hundreds of people see her naked every week, except me. Needless to say it was quite vexing.
If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.
May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" across the painting)
Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'
Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!
Wow! Hey, theres Clare. I better go down.
so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?
Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?
(To his parents) So? What do you think?
I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.
But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?
Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this uh considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check?
Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.
(to Elaine) I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog. (to George) Get this one "I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest".
Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?
I never heard anybody curse in a toast.
Oh no! >click click< Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!
(surprise) You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building too?
Fasten your seat belts. we're goin' to see the baby.
Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a person could still make a mistake like that.
Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.
Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.
I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.
You know, I think I'll just take the check.
How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet!
Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?
Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar!
Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.
Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.
Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town.
Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.
Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.
Many times. You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet.
Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift. I know, it's a label maker. The Label Baby Junior. Yeah, I hear they're good. Well, label me thankful. Okay, well you enjoy those tickets. Buh-bye.
Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia, watching Jerry on TV. Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.
Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!
You what?! Get out! (pushes Kramer) Ten thousand?
Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.
Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give it back to me.
What I said. Ive been under a lot of stress.
I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example.
Am I going? It was three nights ago.
It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.
Have you noticed people staring at your head?
George got him fired. He squealed on him.
Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'
No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!
Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on.
Hey, could you do me a favour? [pause] Could you shut-up?
Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.
It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse "ha's." You know those?
I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!
See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. (Elaine laughs.) All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free.
Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?
Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the verge of this big promotion?
You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. (with a British accent) "Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you".
Ah, actually, I ka, kinda had some things to do.
Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?
Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so fuck(bleeped)ing good.
So when somebody has B.O., the "O" usually stays with the "B". Once the "B" leaves, the "O" goes with it.
So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?
Come on up. (Jerry presses the second button and opens the apartment door. He walks back to the couch.) Oh, all right, forget it, Im gonna take it with me now... (He picks up the cushions.) Im just gonna pack up the cushions right now...
What do you care? You don't believe in hell.
Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed like ten new minutes.
Wait a minute! (A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.)
You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there.
Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with you?
I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?
Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll watch 'em go slice this fat bastard up. (sips coffee)
But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.
You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.
I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.
Now, all we gotta do is write it.
There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
(pointing out the obvious) George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him.
Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please.
(singing) Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home.
Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business.
You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.
Hmm. So you feel "women and children first," in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.
You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake.
(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.
Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door)
(grunting as he throws bread into the air)
Oh, I cant believe it. Let me see that. (Jerry takes the paper.) Thats four and a half points in three days! Thats almost half my money!
They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again.
Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?
Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other?
Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.
Well I, I can't believe this. I know Phil, he, he's a good friend of mine. We play softball together. How could this be?
(reading) 'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie, hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'
I said, "How come no one's killed her?" Probably shouldn't have said anything,
Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to give it up.
Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?
And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.
What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.
No he's going downtown to guard the suit.
Yeah, I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her.
Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.
Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?
Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?
No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time?
Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.
Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.
Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?
Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.
Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.
Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- Ill be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too.
See ya. (Jane Leaves; after the door closes Kramer jumps in shock) what's with you?
A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guys got a coma going like this  you dont want to mess with it.
(picks up phone) Hello? (listens) Oh, hi Mr. Pitt.
(leaving; singing) She'll be coming around the mountain...
Here. Take a look. What, what is that?
This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.
I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?
Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions.
Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.
Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.
We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk.
Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
(impressed) Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.
(as Ping rambles on ) ...S'cuse me (Ping looks up) Kind of an expensive call.
No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch)
Youre movin in, youre a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars. (Elaine is shocked, Jerry opens the door to the hall.) Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I dont even wanna see it, go, get it out.
Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read. I was wondering if-
You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.
Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?
God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?
(Pointing) I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.
What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.
Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.
I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.
They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?
Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.
I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?
So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?
I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.
I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
(Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical..
I, I'm not happy with what I wrote.
Oh who made you a Mohel? Whadya, get your degree from a matchbook?
(to George) So did you bring the lease? (George takes the lease from his inside pocket and hands it to Jerry.) All right, gee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time.
Alright, Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.)
So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.
I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!
Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is who's responsible for this?
(Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?
(agreeing) well three years is a long time to be married.
Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie "Cinderfella". I got 'em at an auction.
Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!
Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?
No, its not that. It wasnt all one-sided.
I don't know how I feel about it.
(answering machine) leave a message and I?ll call you back, thanks. JOE DIVOLA Jerry, Joe Divola. *Pbt* *Pbt* *Pbt* I have a hair on my tongue, I can't get it off, you know how much I hate that? Course you do, you put it there. I know what you said about me Seinfeld. I know you badmouthed me to the execs at NBC, put the kibosh on my deal. Now I?m gonna put the kibosh on you. You know I?ve kiboshed before, and I will kibosh again.
Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.
Oh really? (tries turning away in the hopes Elaine gets the hint; thinking) Oh God, I gotta get out of this.
Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.
A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?
But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.
So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?
Yknow, my parents are coming in for this...
(indicating the woman) Game, set and match, huh Milos?
My car? You drove it into the swamp!
I don't know him. I know who he is.
Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives. (Picks up phone and dials) Hello Tim? Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you? Well it turns out I can use them. Oh, you do? I understand. Okay. Bye. He already made plans, he can't change them.
What do you mean? They know we're here.
You're cut off, you're out of the loop!
Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.
So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these types of people.
Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.
So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did?
Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey!
Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles...
Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.
Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.
Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation.
It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.
So you don't cry when your grandmother dies? But a hotdog makes you lose control?
You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?
Yeah but theres a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet.
Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.
(Like an Army general) Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys.
I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?
It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.
All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've flown first class, Elaine-- I can't go back to coach. I can't... I won't...
See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think?
I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
You can't go to China What about your job?
Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex.
Hold it, hold it...Look your gonna need the jaws of life to get out of those things.
So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.
He yells and you don't get your soup.
I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.
Kramer, why do you have to (noticing Newman) Hello, Newman.
Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar.
This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!
Yeah, its some place down in the village.
(looking at Kramer's moustache) Uh, we're not doing that anymore.
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.
She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?
So, tell me anyway. Who was the BIG mastermind?
But I could do that and the music.
Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner
I don't know, opera, it?s not my kind of thing.
Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour.
I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)
Oh the baby's fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt.
Shes limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.
Gee, I just didnt expect it from the way youve been acting.
I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.
Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?
Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle...
It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?
Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.
Ma, you cant look up words in the dictionary! (to Morty) Dad, shes cheating!
No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?
Now thats not fair! So where did you meet this guy?
I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife fight for a citrus drink.
Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.
No, really, I just got off the phone with him.
What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you.
You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
(animated) You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about.
Yes it will, now give me those keys!
No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I wouldve said tonight.
I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.
No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.
Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour, then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night.
Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm alarge.
No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.
That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus?
No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage?
Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.
oh.. uh.. you know your breath is a little garlicky you better take some gum.
No I wasn't there. (enters and slams the door)
Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a men's room. That's the end of that.
You know you're not supposed to drink while you're keeping a secret! (Elaine laughs) Is there anything else?
Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.
...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either.
Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice?
Oh no, where's the blood? (opens the fridge) It's in here isn't it?
I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.
(from the back of the club, leaving) That's it I'm calling in the big guns.
It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?
Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 650 AM tomorrow morning.
I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!
Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?
What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to Kramers door) Ah hah.
Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?
Ah, here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) Mmm, delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some.
No, hes It. He wins. It is good.
Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.
yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas..
Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless.
Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.
Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for?
If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened.
Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.
Oh, shes really great. I mean, shes got like a real warmth about her and shes really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better.
Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful.
Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?
I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.
I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code.
You cant have that coat, it's not yours.
Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! (Kramer is speechless) I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet.
No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.
(coming out from the bathroom) who was it?
Oh! but I do. There's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar. ( as he says this Newman is wildly scratching behind his back. he suddenly stops when Jerry turns around)
You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.
(with no emotion) It's okay. Everything is going to be all right.
It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.
(seeing Kramer struggle to open a soda, spilling it all over) I think the damage is probably already done. (interrupting Kramer's inadequate attempt to clean up the soda) All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene.
Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off.
Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.
No don't do this. You're not doing this. I will fight you. No you don't... No.
Oh, did you get that outta my bag?
You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. (Phone rings, he answers it) Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend.
Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.
Yes, I know youre not gonna do it. Thats why I bet.
(walking out) Thanks for having me over, guys.
Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?
Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.
So as he's telling the story he starts crying.
What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up.
I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.
Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him.
(To Assistant) I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?
I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination. I would have killed this man. Torn him limb from limb, ripped the flesh right off his bones ...
You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I give you 50 bucks.
Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, "Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land." (Imitates cannon operator) "I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you."
Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?
Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?
Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.
Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. (indicating) Come on in. You got the cigars?
AH. Yes that's gonna make a big difference.
I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.
(pulling out a tape from his pocket) Vvvvup. Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your feet up?
Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.
(Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here..
Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?
The old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go "how do you like crotch?" If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly.
So what your genitals are still lined up.
(Stunned) No, keep it. (Elaine enters the apartment) Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.
Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off.
Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.
The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.
You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!
So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?
Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.
What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these, like Superman? I've got to unlock this mystery.
(animated) Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and you sold a Cadillac?!
Oh my god, he knows. (Jerry and Gino scrambling) Go. (yelling to the door) One second.
All right, but you have to go now.
hunky.. Tony.. hey hey hey (fools around with his collar again)
You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.
12 gauge. Seems to be the most popular gauge.
Let's get outta here. [to Buckles] I'll see ya.
Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere... I got my bags, I'm ready to go.
No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?
(looking over the list) Hmm ah. I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?
Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?
He's a boy who lives in a bubble.
(Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after him!
Why, what's wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders)
But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.
(Gesturing to Ellen) Kramer, George, this is Ellen.
I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.
Oh I dont know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing.
(aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?
Oh yeah, well why don?t you Just get lost.
She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.
Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself.
What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?
(to Kessler) Yeah. (to the phone) Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem.
That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. (goes knocking on Kramer's)
Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. (Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks at Kramer.)
Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test.
Oh, big fighting marlin. (Jerry acts like he is catching a marlin)
(on phone) Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act (pauses for response from Adrian) No new material (Elaine enters) He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week, it killed. (waves hello to Elaine; pauses for response from Adrian) Thank you, thanks fo.. you will not regret this. Ok, Bye. (hangs up phone; to Elaine) Hey.
(picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt off?
Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton. **
Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!
Yeah, and, (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly exiting) time.
That was our babka. We had that babka!
Just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces Kramer) Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!
No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car.
What do you think the dry-cleaners is your own personal closet!
Have you thought any more about that trip?
I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.
(As George sits down) George, we need to talk.
So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?
I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!
He was in the shop. I thought you told me he wasn't going to be there.
Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.
..living together after a while we... we might start to get on each others nerves a little.
All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now, be reasonable you cannot turn down $50 for a $6 rye.
George is pickin' us up at the airport.
You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?
I like that thing in your hair there.
Kramer!!! (Jerry points to the lamp post they are about to crash into)
Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?
You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-
Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!
(Over the phone) Elaine, youve got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin me on this car, which is yellow now!
Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)
Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.
Yeah, okay. (to Elaine) They may have found the car.
That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?
(Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..
(Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?
I didnt know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrants going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesnt make sense. Am I wrong?
Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'
Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?
And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.
If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber.
Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.
That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice.
Uh, this is George. (reaches for her name) Im sorry...
Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him )
Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up!
Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.
Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.) You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?
Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.
I like your nails, that is a great color.
STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this? Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.
Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --
No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.
No, go ahead, I second-hand smoke two packs a day.
(to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)
Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)
The fabric of society is very complex George.
And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She says, "That's funny." ... That's funny!
I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?
No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. Whats important is you two getting back together. Eh, then well talk about the car.
I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.
Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?
Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to an open box) isn't that one of yours?
Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
Its very good cantaloupe. (Kramer leaves; to George) So thats it? Youre out?
Oh, oh take it back. Let's get another one.
Whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guyll be like, I dont think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life? And of course the womans looking at the guy, thinking, What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?
I mean, if were gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.
Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.
It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?
I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend.
(aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!
Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?
The bad fianc&Mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...
You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.
Great. One of the best jobs I ever had.
You know what? I'll be with you in a minute.
Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, No egg white omelets. Look at that.
And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.
Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.
(Stops) Alright, that's not gonna work, it's not gonna work. Let me just think for a second here.
Uh, again? (Limping towards the door) I'll be right there.
Well, what's going on? What is this thing?
Uhm, hold, hold on a second. (pauses counting) I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.
Oh, I know her. I know her type.
You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught.
No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.
. Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it
I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?
Just go back and ask him again. (Slams the door on Kramer)
Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
You had a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with my butler?
Well, that's it! Tonight's the night. I'm getting one. No "if and's or but's".
Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)
Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something.
Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!
I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..
Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?
Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?
Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!
What did you have to give your TV away to George for?
(buzzes her up) Eh. (to Kramer) You know and I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying "my wife." Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - "my wife" this, "my wife" that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence.
No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking.
Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.
Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.
Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!
Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I cant ask her.
I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.
I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? (Kramer comes in) A real dermatologist.
Oh, I was just looking for er, some... gum or... mint.
Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.
(To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom buzzes) That's Elaine. (Kramer buzzes her in. Jerry talks into the phone) Kramer.. (To Kramer) George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.
(to Kramer and Morty) What is this about?
Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you do likewise.
If I like their race, how can that be racist?... Hellooo??... Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!... Yyy-yes, I am calling George... Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!
All the time. Ive been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I cant live like this. I dont know what Im gonna do. Im heading for breakdown! (to Harold) Cant you do something?
(Stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. (Approaches the intercom) C'mon, let's get it together.. (Through intercom) Yeah?
Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?
Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, "Hey, they like the soup! Keep it up!"?
She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing to George) He likes the pop-in, too.
(Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.
(looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!
(cont) and this whole justice league, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman. You mean to tell me Superman can't cover everything?
Kramer , there's no way you're sleeping with me.
(To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up)
Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.
Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I?m the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me!
It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.
So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.
No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.
Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said "Too bad he's gay".
No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything off me, first laughs now ladies.
Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.
(on the phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second. (George walks in  Jerry asks George) So we definitely dont want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes his head NO) Alright, were back together again, great. Bye bye.
You're not a little anything, Newman. So just pack it up and move it out of here.
(impatiently cutting in) Hey Elaine What about the crest.? What d'you think of the crest here.
I'm not letting you cheat, Newman. You're not getting anywhere near that board.
I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from.
Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!
(Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..
I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?
Yeah. (hands racquet to Kramer) I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it.
(cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You havent been out of the building in ten years!
I didn't know it was possible not to know that.
Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?
'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?
So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.
That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and-
Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.
I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it.
You spent the night at James's? Did we?
I can't believe she threw out my napkin.
Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer.
No,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.
Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?
The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting out that marriage.
You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go... up.
There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.
(Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.
It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.
Hey ,You think that Shelly's upset that I made such a big deal about the pecan.
Nice Mohel picking, Elaine. You picked a helluva Mohel!
Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.
These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86.
The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.
Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I would've asked her.
They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.
Yeah, well that relationships really got a lot of potential.
A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in The Blob.
All right, I'll call 911. Think he did it? Could've he done it? Couldn't done it? How could've he done it? Couldn't be? Could it? Hello 911? How are you? I'm sorry it was just a reflex...I know it's an emergency number...it is an emergency...my friend is being accused of being a smog strangler and I know he didn't do it...they're putting me trough to the detective in charge of the investigation...what is my name? Who am I? I'm eh...George Costanza...
I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it.
That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?
You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.
(beginning to cough and struggle) Getting weak... Losing power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing without me. Nothing!
Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated.
Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.
Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.
So what does he care if you put lifts in?
(opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.
Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity.
So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything.
So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?
(answering the phone) Hello? Yeah, the van is still for sale. Sure, come on buy.
What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!
He really did an amazing job. Look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid! (Jerry opens refrigerator.) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups! Come here, look at this. (He gets on his knees and points.) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there?! He must be like Rubber Man!
So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here.
I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.
Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me?
Then what do you call it? People dont just bump into each other and have sex. This isnt cinemax.
I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out.
The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.
Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck.
(privately amused) Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while. (indicating Elaine) Her too.
(Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) "Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone." (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out "Just go" while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. (Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her.
I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.
Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there.
And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.
Should I get it? I hate these moments. Im hearing the dual voices now, you know, What about the money? Whats money?
I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I cant imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but thats me. Alright
Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, "This is good, who is this? I like this person". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, (pretending to wake up) "Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!"
I didnt tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog?
Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.
This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!
Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.
Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything.
Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno.
September 21st, first day of Autumn. Leaves changing colours.. Beautiful colors.
I know nothing, but what did you actually do?
Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!
Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to fancy restaurants. (takes a sip of water)
Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!
I'm not a foodie. I don't, "Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty." Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book. What is this? The story of the bill? "Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.." What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating from the restaurant? What is this about?
Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!
I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.
(to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?
Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!
So lemme ask you this how long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night.
What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?
I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or somebody? What's with this guy? (Gino looks at him annoyed) Just asking.
So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?
(Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?
Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.
(annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? Besides it's not a submarine and there's no room for a periscope in a car.
I-I-I don't like the opera. What are they singing for? Who sings? You got something to say, say it!
I cant think about it now. Come on, Im going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.
I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.
I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.
No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.
Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?
How could you leave a message like that on my machine.?
Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer, sitting on his lawn chair with a sparkler)
Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?
Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested)
(to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? (wondering what the hell's Kramer doing)
This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes) Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?
If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened.
I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!
I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say.
(Reading words George wrote on his hand) "Matthew, Luke, Paul", what youre cheating on your conversion chest?
They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?
Are you sure? Oh boy, here we go.
If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.
Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?
You wanna go with me up to (clap) the Bronx and see if there's any flyers on George's car.
Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.
We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it?
By the way, just for the record -
No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.
This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!
Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
(ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.
So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table
.. and uh, underwear and a tee shirt.
Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.
Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.
Oh. (chuckles) Really? You don't seem that desperate.
(gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!
(Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?
..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye. HA Ha..Who do these women think they're dealing with? Did she think she was gonna leave this incredibly erotic message on my tape and I was just gonna let it go. Not Bloody likely...
A half hour, give me a half our.
This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!
I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.
What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What are you Peter Lorre?
I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.
Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a One-woman show?
Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didnt like the looks of the defense and changed the play.
You'll be out before we get the check.
No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out.
(Knocking on Kramer's door) Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey.
(flips a roll of paper towels in the air) Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.
You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.
You're still trying to gget that free sub?
I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...
Oh, that guy was your cousin! (walking in front of George so he gets the picture to leave)
So, can you believe that message? Now I?ve got to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.
So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.
Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
I don't know  he's got some valuable antiques, He's worried they'll break something.
Actually it's being taken care of right now.
What, you got a problem with the pen now?
I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.
So, I guess you dont find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?
So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?
We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.
Honey, what'd you do with the can opener?
You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But its really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesnt it? "I really am a doctor you know. You think Im not, just check it out." I dont know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. "Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and Ill give you my opinion." After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what theyre talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants.
(opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?
So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?
Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...
Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.
Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.
(picking up his bag and coat) Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?
Do you want me to break up with you?
But there's no "t" in your name. What about G-bone?
Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.
You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... (he spots a mailman crouched emptying a box) Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.
(on the phone) hey Andre, get the hell off the phone!
Well it?s very flattering. How did you get these tickets, I heard they're impossible to get.
The apple pie you had today at Monks
You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? When I'm on stage that's all I hear; You stink, You suck. We like magic.
What you do say about a guy like this, huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. But your loyalty is beyond question.
NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.
Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!
Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.
Hey. Why didn't cha get the big one?
You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.
Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.
Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.
So, its okay? I could just tell her she can have it?
Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.
What do you need a job, you got Audrey.
That's not going to be good for anybody.
The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.
They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.
Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail.
It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.
(on the phone) Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.
Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.
Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.
Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?
Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what are you doing?
I was out in the snow last night.
No, no Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.
Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
Thats comforting. Shh. Hes coming. (to Ray) Ray?
Hey, I got a real thing about "shushing"!
This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-
H... G... F. Seat four. One, two, three... f-- Hello Newman.
Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.
(Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?
Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...
I just wanted to say how sorry I was...
(to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?
I don't know. What if I get caught?
(cynical) This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday?
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine)
Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our prices, we'll give you the store.
If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.
Hey buddy. I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's like in there, all night long things are creaking and cracking. And that red light is burning my brain!
So know every time you get dressed. You are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer.
Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that canvas?
I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I dont know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because its really not a definite thing yet. (crowd cheers him on to tell them) Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that Ive received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. (audience applauds) Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didnt even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, thats what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, You may have already won. Id like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, You have definitely lost! You turn it over, giant printing, Not even close! You open it up, theres this whole letter of explanation, Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest.
to himself Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.
(looking at the Wizard) Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents.
No. The police have no leads (sitting on the couch arm) and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.
Well, I dont really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.
I mean it's no big deal. You're still drivin'. You should have been watching the road.
It's a movie stub from the 930 show. George, I think Willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes.
Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.
I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.
I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.
This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...
Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.
I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.
So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial?
(Nodding, trying it out) "I'm there for you."
I don't even know if I remember the number.
All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! (Audience boos)
Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her Im sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.
Ate? What? What the hell are you talking about? Now you listen to me, you get out of that apartment this instant. If you screw this up for me I swear....
Oh yeah. He's good. You know he's John Ritter's cousin.
I think thats the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!
Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.
Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What drives me to take chances like that?
Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.
(Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.
Now we have to buy a new couch?!
What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him, I dont think were right for each other. Hes a guy! At least with a woman, theres a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.
I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.
Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.
That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!
Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.
The main thing is to keep the line moving.
That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.
Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.
How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?
Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.
What are you bringing snowballs in here for?
Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.
I just got the most bizarre message from you father, Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!
Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?
Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.
No you can't. (hangs up the phone) Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?
He never heard of corduroy! True story, true story.
Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are?
Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...
How do you do? (introducing himself) Uh, Jerry Seinfeld.
There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her
The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?
He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.
Franco's no good? ...They got no team leaders.
Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.
Same as you cant overwet. You see, once something is wet, its wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die youre dead, right? Lets say you drop dead and I shoot you. Youre not gonna die again, youre already dead. You cant overdie, you cant overdry.
A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision.
We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.
Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.
Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.
(Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine?
(stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem?
Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Yknow Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, shes probably screamin at those aliens, I gotta have a lo mein!
You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.
What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. (Hangs up)
Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!
Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it.
If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.
Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner.
Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.
What the hell he's supposed to be on medication I don't understand he told me he's getting medication what happened to his medication!?
-programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'
The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.
Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.
You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.
All right, so uh, let's do something later. How 'bout a movie?
Hey Seth. Man it is coming down hard out there.
Elaine, you cannot judge a person on a situation like that. I mean it's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert
Oh, great. Ok we'll goin' away. I think I'm excited.
I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
They guy's in my house right now. What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.
Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.
Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent. It's very boring.
I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.
I might need you to get me a soda.
Well, senator, Id just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it.
You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, whats going on?
Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?
Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?
But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?
You better finish your little caf latte there. They won't let you in with it.
Kind of in the middle of something here, George.
Let me explain something to you. You see, youre not normal. Youre a great guy, I love you, but youre a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldnt understand.
You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. (Picks up the phone.) She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...
(Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off George, and puts it back on his bed)
And she was beautiful in that bra! I'm crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging, free wheeling attitude!
Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.
Yes. Hes a doctor. (Elaine starts to leave. ) Wait a second. (Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in Elaines purse.) (to George) What are you doing?
I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles.
So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?
Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.
Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...
I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.
And that waist cincher, that was the topper!
Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.
Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?
Well, go in there and talk to her. She's not going to put em on the glass.
Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.
Well, You can't go in there it's like a gas chamber in there.
Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for? I don't know about that, I'll have to think about it. I'll let you know. Okay, bye.
They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What do they look like."
I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.
No, let's just do it. (Fire alarm goes off) What? What is going on? What is that about?
See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! Then come out with the regular!
Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-
The wheels are in motion, things are happening!
I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.
No, go ahead. Look at this place. I cant wait to get it cleaned.
Wait a minute, that's my ticket! You didn't even want to go.
Understand you had a little talk with him too.
Hey, wait a second. You know, we could share a cab. They're playing at the same Cineplex.
(struggling to open a bottle with his bandaged finger) I can't do it. (A LA GODFATHER) Look what they did to my boy, They massacred my boy.
That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.
Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's better than eating it.
I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' (mimes throwing) 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?
I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.
(Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?
...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.
For crying out loud, He's Superman. (Fulton stops laughing, Jerry's face is stunned) Fulton? (looks at him) Fulton?
Kramer's Andre, he's fooling around with these 976 numbers (Kramer walks out of the bedroom) hey I told you, I don't want you doing that on my phone
I can't go until I find my cufflinks.
"Hey! Hey! Watch it.!... You're drooling all over the floor. How much Novocaine did that guy give you."
Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?
(wistful) I don't know, I just see you guys together.
(Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.
No. We gotta go to the soup place.
Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?
I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.
I guess you can take anything, but actual work.
You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it?
Women need to like the job of the guy theyre with. If they dont like the job, they dont like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. Well, right now, Im the regional management supervisor. Im in development, research, consulting... Men on the other hand  if they are physically attracted to a woman  are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men dont really care. Menll just go, Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? Youre just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why dont you shower up, and well get some burgers and catch a movie.
(Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here.
Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.
They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.
Just get the key and let's get out of here.
What, are you serious...why, why did she call?
(quietly) I told you to cut it out.
So how come you're not going over there for dinner?
Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?
Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.
Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way.
Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!
Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.
Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do?
Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?
Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...
Yeah!.. Thanks.Oh! my god you saved my life.
So were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.
So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist. You just called the woman for a date.
Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.
So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?
This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.
It would be nice to care about someone.
She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.
You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.
I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.
(George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party?
Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.
I don't know. I just feel he should call me.
You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal(sp?) before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.
What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like it?
and that's why you're going out with him
Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye. (Hangs up) Hey, I'm flyin' first class.
Well, uh, I uh, I dont want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe its not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.
So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.
Yeah, yeah. Sometimes shes on time, and... sometimes shes late.
I did. Im just curious. Its been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points? (to Vanessa) Its up six points!
I'm gonna call the cops. That?s what I?m doing, I?m calling the cops.
(holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.
I had a statue! What should I do?
Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
[To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.
Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?
You know why? Because people like to say "salsa." "Excuse me, do you have salsa?" "We need more salsa." "Where is the salsa? No salsa?"
(thinking; quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
No, I told you, it's just a dry run.
George! Can we focus on the car, here?
Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!
Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.
There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...
Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.
I'm sorry. Got any booze? What's say you and I get ripped!
Oh, w-what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore?
But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?
Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.
No! [throws her purse back at her] No, I mean, no thank you, nah...
I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.
I was an idiot for listening to you!
I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping.
Ya sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? (Meryl laughs. The owner of the coffee shop comes over.)
(Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!
(in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine) So did you figure out Darryl's... you know.
Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time.
(seeing Elaine enter Monk's) Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body?
She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator...
Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.
No, I don't wanna see the naked people.
Yeah. I want that coat. (Jerry opens his wallet, looking for the dry-cleaning ticket)
Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.
Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy.
See you later. (to Elaine) Well we cant all be dating podiatrists. (Elaine laughs)
Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. (George laughs) So, when do you move into the apartment?
Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?
When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.
In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.
(long pause -- did he hear "ridicurous" -- should he say something -- can't decide if he should. Finally...) Did you say, "ridicurous"?
Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*!
Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.
[whispering] No, no news. You better get out of here.
Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.
No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.
A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business.
Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.
(On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.
It's like Im talking to my Aunt Sylvia here.
Uhn-uh-uhn - Uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer A-Ha ha! Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe. (singing) dee, de-de, de-de-de-de-de (Makes G.I. Joe swim off, legs kicking)
I thought youre like Hitler in the bunker?
Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome.
Oh, Hey, there's a name you don't forget.
I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!
I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?
Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.
Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.
(arriving at apartment, sees Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from Kramer's) So you live right... there.
Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact with --
And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard-working Americans!
Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.
Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)
So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) "Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again." They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system..."Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to the plane in my apartment." You see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet "hide-a-key" under the wing..."maybe he left it up there somewhere..."
I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.
(ironic outrage) The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!
...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.
We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.
Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.
Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved.
Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.
No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
Why can't I buy my father a car?
I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table.
Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone? You wanted the machine. You know, and you're always kind of thrown off, (left hand up to side of face, pretending its a receiver) you go "Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you."
(eating pop corn) hmm I love this artificial flavoring I like it better than butter I think it's more consistent
He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.
Oh, what about this one? Look at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for. (Sits on the couch.) Oh, yeah!
Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
It's okayit's just a hot dog, (still sobbing) everything is going to be okay.
(picks it up) I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table.
Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you.
You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!
You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift.
It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.
You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.
The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too.
You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.
(also wearing a moustache) What do you mean, 'what is it?' It's a country right next to Belgium.
Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! Nice job on the circumcision but it's not supposed to be a finger.
Well, maybe he doesn't have a "get outta here" kind of personality.
What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says " Aw, I'll just have some coffee." There's no truth to that.
I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.
Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. He's a punk, a patsy, a hack.
oh you're afraid he might look like Zippy the pinhead
Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?
Whats with the pink lining and the candy stripes?
I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!
I will, I just walked in the door.
I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)
Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...
It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
"No no you said George likes spicy chicken."
That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.
Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?
Go outside and see if he's still there.
Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. You had to give him a box of cigars.
Hey. So, ah, Ramon this is my friend Elaine.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.
(Pointing) But are you still master of your domain?
Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!
What the hell...? Why is the door open?
Ill call him. (Jerry picks up the cordless phone. He points to the rotary phone on the coffee table. Kramer, George, and Elaine struggle for it.) Hello, Ray?... Hi, Ray, this is Ravas friend, Elaines friend, Jerry... The King of Comedy, right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? (He covers the reciever and yells at Kramer and George.) Would you shut up?! (to the phone) Yeah, you dont want to talk about it over the phone?.. You dont want Rava to hear?... Yeah, I understand... You know that coffee shop near my house, Monks?... All right, tomorrow... One o clock... Great, okay, bye.
(CONT'D) And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.
Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.
(to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here.
Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before. Your hook is too small. This is for, like, a muffin. All right. Take it away.
So she tought I did it to get back at her
Well, you know; not everything. I do what I can.
Oh, I cant begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.
Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?
You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?
No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.
Oh, no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down. (George & Jerry each slide to the end of their booth seats)
How do you know she's not my wife?
No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him.
Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.
Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... what kind of a sicko would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide (small fingers opening imaginary drawers) Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT hard to get round black buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this? ... is it such a great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, you'll never find them - they save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they're going to fall off too that's the other thing ...
Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?
What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's - it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it, and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you. (Nodding)
Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that.
Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.
Meat? I dont, I dont know, go... hunt! (Kessler opens the refrigerator and sticks his head in.) Well what happened in the game anyway?
But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there, "Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin. Well I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on."
At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.
I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!
Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just "recede into the night," if you know what I mean.
Ok, great, well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu.
Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.
No, it&Mac226;s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i...
Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.
Yours?....You know what I'll think I'll brush later.
He asked me to. We were getting along.
All right take it easy, just take it easy.
No, shes a little too cheery for me.
Well you said they could come and take the records.
(trying to shut the trunk hood) Something wrong with this trunk.
(smugly, under-his-breath) Not only that, I broke his thumbs.
What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.
What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?
Hey...I'm not stupid. I'm looking in that drawer, there's no can opener.
Well, I'm very mysterious by nature. (Jerry knocks on the door) A lot of women find that attractive.
You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.
Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy.
Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!
Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log.
(throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?
More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.
No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.
That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
I would like to know what my names doin in this creep's organizer to begin with.
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you dont have to be home on time.
Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.
Yeah, and youre just what shes looking for too  a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.
Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind.
No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.
He was running from a bee. (Elaine laughs)
That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.
I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight....
Fifty years they were married. Now hes moving to Pheonix.
Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight!
(turning to Elaine; thinking) Oh no, not now.
It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.
(emphatic) I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!
(on the phone) Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Ya. Oh, really? Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye. (hangs up the phone) Well, the yogurt verdict is in. (Kramer looks at Jerry with his arms out) Fat!
The % thing to do is just not think about it.
Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.
(motions of making out) Well you were involved in some sort of amorous...
That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother.
Go ahead shake his hand. You're Jerry Seinfeld. You've been on the Tonight Show.
So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you this thing was good!
What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.
I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.
Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?
No. I think it's Demi. (the "i" sounds like an "e")
Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy.
On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?
A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!
I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.
No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's.
Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.
Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one.
(Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this.
Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph?
Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there.
Right. For the reducing of the pond scum?
(acting like he was walking on stage) Hey how ya doing? Good to be here.
(pause) If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?
Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?'
So, uh, whats your son doing now, Dr. Stevens? Oh, hes a public fornicator. Yes, hes a fine boy...
(jumps in surprise) Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be gone.
All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little.
Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that?
(in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.
I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? "Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!"
(apologetically) Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.
(Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled "Ori-dent") Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!
What are you talking about? It's my car. Let me pay for the gas.
I dunno , I'm gonna ask Shelley ,but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident.
(Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.
No, I just wanted to see what time it was.
(A couple of days ago I used a public phone), go over time on the call, hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, "Yeah, operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?"
I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
Yknow I think that even if youve had a relationship with someone, or lets say, especially if youve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, its very difficult. Isnt this? Its hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. Its like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, Look, a rabbit. The other goes, So? I believe this is your card. Look, why dont we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?
You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."
(Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.
No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.
Were taking Elaine to dinner. Shes got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?
Well, if that's not that, what is that?
No, look, you don't understand. I, I want the picture.
So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--
Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?
I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?
That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.
Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!
(shaking his head no) No Kramer I don't want to talk to him.
I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.
Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.
So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?
So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?
Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something?
You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?
So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show, I waited for you, you never came.
Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.
What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.
No ,no I don't, I mean, Don't be silly..
(Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.
Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.)
Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.
How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable special . I 've never gotten a cable special.....well that's it I'm not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado. (to the silent Kramer on the couch beside him) ...Exactly.
Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly.
You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're lifting heavy suit cases.
Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.
Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors.
So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye.
(opens the door for George) Where did you get that?
I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You know (does the motion for the check) Check, Check. Unless the waiter isn't too shape then you gotta total it up. Sometimes they come over, "Do you want the check?" No I wanna be pen pals, can't you see what I'm doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people.
See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'.
Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?
Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to begin with! Let's face it. I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's that!
(To George) You're givin' him back that TV.
(To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?
The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.
We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men.
Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did!
What are you looking at? (Kramer goes out onto the terrace and looks down.) Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold.
He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV.
[with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?!
Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.
It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...
The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?
Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.
Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!
Ohh ... (takes the ticket and heads for the dressing room)
She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.
He asked you to watch them not wear them.
You're pretty comfortable up there eh, Bubble boy?
(opening the door) Well, it was nice meeting you.
You see , I kept up my end of the pact.
It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. "It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad." But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, "I refuse to put any thought into this at all." Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?
Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.
Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.
Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice.
Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye.
Let me in, it's me. (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the dressing room) Here. You don't know what this is costing me. (hands Kramer the ticket)
(a la "Don Corleone") Never go against the family, Elaine.
"Of course" was the last thing he said?
(Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining room doorway) I think the busboy's in trouble.
(to the Drake) Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye...
I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand.
So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?
So how did you leave it with him?
(to the phone) Hello yeah yes it is really ah, ah Could you hold on a second? (to George and Kramer) Hey listen to this, some woman found an electronic organizer, my name was in it, she wants me to help her track down the owner.
Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.
I got your message, (sitting) so I came straight from Atlantic City.
What, he doesn't like my taste in music?
(incredulous) You asked her to move in with you?
Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?
Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.
What if he doesn't call now out of spite?
(Noting) You know, I've never seen you drive.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!
(to George) No. (to Kramer) I told you not to say anything.
Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.
August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress! She never changes! Oh my god. (looking around) She's gotta have hundreds of these dresses.
Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it.
Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.
Oh Yeah we went way out and wild.
We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.
So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that...
You know, if your future was a little more certain..
Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.
Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,
Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman...
Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions.
Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!
Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.)
Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.
What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him?
(a la "Don Corleione") Elaine, never ask me about my business!.... (SHEEPISH) "Godfather."
(on phone) Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago.
Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show.
What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with. [To attendant] What is going on?
I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.
(dry) I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw? (really disappointed) Let's get out of here George.
Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.
Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?
What are we doing out here? Aren't we going to go in and eat?
(unheard by Jenna) When the battery runs out.
Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.
Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?
Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world He's Boring.
Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.
Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?
(spits the nut) OooH!!! You. you ate these? You sucked on these and put them on the plate?
Let's check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil.
That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!
Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?
Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.
(Once again, the audience hears his thoughts) I'm so car sick. I'm gonna vomit!
I think he's the same age as the father.
Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. Shes usually pretty punctual. Dont you find that, George?
(Interrupts) Excuse me...Excuse me... Are you asking him out ?
Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.
Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.
Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!
I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone.
Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we play one for all the marbles?
Are you nuts? You dont even know the guy.
You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!
What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.
Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.
Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!
How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a minute. Poppy's from Tuscany. I'm gonna go call him.
Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How many of those did we go to?
Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.
Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.
(under his breath) Well, this worked out just as I had hoped.
Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary.
Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.
Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?
(Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them!
You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!
Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting a package.
No, I actually find you quite charming. A bit verbose at times...
you know, I think George has a non-sexual crush on him
Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?
Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.
Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.
This thing has never worked right. (holding the machine in his hand)
Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel.
You're lucky they let you drive a car.
But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.
Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.]
Do you want to go with him? You go. I dont mind.
You know I can't get this *damn thing* to sleep. (about the Yo-Yo)
Sex... to save the friendship. (Elaine drops her bag, takes off her jacket and walks into Jerry's bedroom) Well, if we have to (un-tucks his shirt) we have to.
Im not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. Ive decided Ill do the work. Im gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? Cause you send your money out there  working for you  a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me. Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.
Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?
(Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.
Oh! There coming to town tomorrow by the way.
Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide.
Oh, they're all the same. Here. [gives him Dust Buster] Now if you'll excuse us, ..
Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do.
Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida.
Ah, so, ah, flower shows and, shopping for pretty bows, and then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight?
Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that?
I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.
Hey, ??? is rerunning the Yankee game. You watching this?
Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.
Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.
To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.
Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason.
It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.
Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way.
I'm gonna get that. (walks across the set towards the blue curtain)
Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?
Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned it...
Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.
And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.
Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.
I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?
(for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.
I had a very interesting lunch with GEORGE Costanza today.
What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must be something. What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks?
No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.
Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, "Those aren't buoys." (Father starts laughing) Father...
I'm in the book and I have a machine.
No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!
If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.
Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.
Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?
Hey, look, there's Bobby Eighteen?s father-in-law, Mr Reichman. George and I were just talking about that today, I can?t believe it! That?s the guy who threw George out of the wedding.
Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!
Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drakes coffee cake
I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.
(taking off his jacket) Slaughtered. Wiped the floor with 'em and (hanging up jacket) not only that, the money was unbelievable.
All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?
I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.
Yes, come on! How often do you get engaged? Come on!
He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?
No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o.
(Nauseated at the saying) Would you please stop saying that?!
Why don't you put it in the *bank*?
You're going out with the stationery store guy?
I don't need a reason to give gifts, it's my nature. I love to make people happy.
You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?
I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.
W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.
Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago.
No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?
That was Elaine , she changed her mind. She's not coming over.
Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?
Thirty-six. What's the signal? Howbout this? Chicken wing? No, no, no, I got a better one. Head patting.
Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets.
Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain.
Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry.
Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die.
You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married.
No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.
who do you think she is? how dare she? you want me to get the manager? too bad they don't have those old ladies walking around with flashlights anymore we'd flush her out
You know, I really... Ive come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that theyre just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you dont really wanna see them. You dont call them, they call you. You dont call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you dont really have anything in common with is to pretend youre hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend theres a little desk around you. The only problem with this is theres no way you can say, Hey, its been great having you on the show. Were out of time.
Id rather not say it out loud. Its embarrassing.
(interrupting) Can I talk to you for a second?
(Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.
(annoyed) All right. (after a pause) Hey, you know what's weird?
Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.
He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?
(trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.
(Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here?
Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.
Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?
"Yeah!!! What is that? I mean isn't that sick. I mean , I'd be embarrassed to have that in my apartment."
..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beveridged!
First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.
Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?
But its common sense. Hes got super strength, super speed. Im sure hes got super humor.
Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!
I really think you're making too much of this.
Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?
Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. (Holds lettuce head) Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts the intellect, represented here (Pulls off tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large piece) Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats tiny piece of lettuce)
Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?
So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?
In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.
You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...
Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one.
No, nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table)
Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.
No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!
Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.
I don't have it. You want half my omelet? (holds his omelet plate up to Bania)
wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to just sense it's in front of the couch?
Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.
Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.
What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?
Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and tear.
I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?
Uh, you know, why dont you go first, you just had a long trip.
Youre wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!
Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley.
Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.
Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency.
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--
I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!
I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
But then anyone can just look in and see you.
You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.
Oh my eh, my Aunt's name is Mulva. She's-she's a masseuse.
No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now.
(Walks over and starts pulling on Kramer's pants) You just gotta wiggle your hips a little bit.
Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.
I thought it was open to the public.
Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.
So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.
Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen?
Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time.
I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how theyre going to look at a thing like this.
(still watching tv; sounds like basketball) Bottle-wipe supercedes it.
So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.
I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a riot.
How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!
So was I right? She likes me, right?
Ah, you know. Im supposed to meet, eh, someone -- Ill, Ill wait for them outside. (walks towards the door)
TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.
I suppose if it was on the protg's way to the mentor, they might.
So George, how do I beat this lie detector?
Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you?
I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody up.
oh look at that I got oil all over me. Can I have your napkin?
It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.
Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'
That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.
Of course I can, am I being funny now?
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.
That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. Its like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you doing today?
Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand and put it on his shoulder)
No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.
And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?
Well... theres a little bit of a problem.
(looks round) Don't worry, I'll get you out.
No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.
No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.
Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?
I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give!
Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.
But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!
Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a, its a little crumpled.
All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.
(impatient) Gone! (starts maniacally laughing) (briefly stops to point and explain) That bumper sticker.
Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.
Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?
So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!
so the woman was walking around in a bra
Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe-- "Jerry Jerry Dingleberry", and-hu "Seinsmelled"...
cool guy? what are you, in 8th grade?
Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door)
Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.
All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.
(walking towards door with Elaine) How long did you last? (opens door)
(scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.
Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.
Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school.
Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.
I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away)
Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?
But if you go back with me , then I'm not.
No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.
Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, You think?
Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing...
That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.
Well, the pickle breath is a good start.
...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're there approving new clothes.....That's a girlfriend job! How dare he!!
So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer.
You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.
(Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.
Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they want
Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.
Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll *all* be over...
Well I guess if I?m the Miana I should go. All right, all right.
Oh, well here. Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it again.
(walking over the the buzzer to answer it) Oh, that's the Flicks.
Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why dont we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. (All three sit down) Now, look, you both find each other attractive, right?
You know, we never had one fight before this deal.
All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.
Oh, see the baby again with the baby..
So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.
Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.
So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?
So, Im on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the...
I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club...
Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He couldn't! (listens) Alright, I will. (listens) Okay, bye.
Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner?
Well you know what this means, don't you?
(flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb.
Come in for two minutes and sit with me.
Ya. (hits the button, opens the door. To Elaine) Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys.
Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.
I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.
Oh, what do you think? I found it at the back of my closet.
Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.
Dont worry about it, it wasnt working anyway.
Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.
--but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is inadvertently sent an insurance--
(walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!
(imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape?
SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?
Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.
She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.
Did you see the look on that guy's face?
No body said youre fat. Hes a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy.
(turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isn't that your charter group?
(re the underwear pile) Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.
All right, forget it, forget it. Im not taking the place!
Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket.
H-Hey, Kramer, wait up. I'll go with you.
What do you say to a person like you?
You, sidle? Y-You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!
Okay, okay. Forget it. Its okay. I didnt mean it.
Im a guy  it always looks like that.
Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down. It's a business.
I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.
No, its, its just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it. (Jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) Ten-fifteen... No, dont be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, its no trouble at all... Ill see you tomorrow... Great, bye. (He hangs up the phone; to Kessler) I dont believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here!
Its a list of excuses, its for that guy, Horneck, whos at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I dont have to see him. (Elaine laughs.) I need it. (Elaine starts writing on the list.) What are you doing?
I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different... sources.
You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.
So, you wanna come up for a few minutes?
Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
Hey I don't even want the pen now!
No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.
But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.
The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.
and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye.
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.
(smiling) Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.
Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon?
Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.
I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.
George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?
Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.
Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Uh, gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. Alright let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... (looks at Joe; Joe gives him a weird look)ooo, just right... and three plantains uh ought to do it.
Well, you know what they say. Lucky in love, Unlucky with fruit.
What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at work?!?
But you said, it can be very serious.
Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!
I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy.
Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.
That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?
I couldnt tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that
Do you have to write all this stuff down.
Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.
(in a tuxedo) So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a woman that won't have sex with you.
No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy.
(in a hurry) Ya how you gonna get all this done in time?
That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact.
And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.
That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.
Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.
(To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. (Gestures to a black Saab)
Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.
Wow, look at you. So you got the job.
I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.
He is merry, I'll give him that. (notices a cactus on the table) What's this plant for?
Oh, I cant. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly.
Pull over? The lieutenant is waiting to see us.
well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.
Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.
I don't mind at all. Why should I mind? What did he say?
That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?
(about the massage)You know I think this is really helping.
I gave you a taste. What do you want?
(re-entering) Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again, are you?
What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?
They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives.
Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.
Oh yeah, Sfuzi? I- I've gotta do that.
Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!
(Joking around) Hey, didn't I beat you up in the fourth grade?
I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.
I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?
(looking of into the distance) I guess that's true...
Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.
I would know if I had a blender.
I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I? (throws coat over his right shoulder)
You didn't like that crack about the pen.
(Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did!
[quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!
First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?
Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup of Decaf. (leaves table)
Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.
Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?
Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. (They both walk to the booth and sit down. Suddenly, Gwen is attractive) Now this is a good looking booth.
Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?
oh uh nothing, she just.. choked on a jujube
When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their face, you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going with somebody.
All right, fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone)
Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!
Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?
Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected, outwardly.
Where did you see that? Those are private!!!
I dont really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because theres that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, youre sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, Im really sorry about this. I dont know why I left that stuff over there. And thats why I could never be a maid, because Id have an attitude. Id find them, wherever they are in the house, Oh, I suppose you couldnt do this? No, dont get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldnt dust. No, this is too tough, isnt it?
Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.
Hes a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.
(reluctant) Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too.
This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.
(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.
And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now.
All right! Take it easy! Take it easy.
Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.
Well, the mans an individualist  he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what hes doing.
Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?
Ill have the, ah, turkey club without the bacon.
(Surprised to see her, he gets up) Where's George?
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.
Oh no. Thats impossible. Id rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.
This is no good. This is no good. Call her house.
Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
So I can see her tonight, and you dont care?
Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.
It's not even my car, it's a rental.
Thats not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table repeatedly.) You know, maybe its not that bad an idea.
Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?
What do you mean you're in the same class?
Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me.
It was just an innocent comment! I didnt know she had a pony!
...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.
I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel.
You dont have to say Wow. I know its Wow. (Kramer smiling) And theres that smile again. Well, what is that? (Intercom buzzes.) Its George.
..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Packyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of (wipes his brow) pizza and uh the uh and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling em (does juggling motions) he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. (Swallows and takes a breath) Well we all just lost it. (Fulton not laughing, stone faced) It was really really funny.
So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.
Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.
Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!
Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....
You should always carry a pad and pen.
So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right?
That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this, okay...
Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?
I really have to go to the bathroom.
I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I dont get this. Arent cows outside most of the time? I dont understand it. When its raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, Let us in, were all wearin leather. Open the door! Were gonna ruin the whole outfit here! Is it suede? I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I cant have this cleaned. Its all I got!
Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.
You got a lot to learn about pancakes.
All right, do you want the quarter, take the quarter, but don't try and tell me it's yours.
Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?
(Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.
Uh, how about a couple of people like us.
I don't like this Kramer. Will it be much longer?
(continuing) The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.
Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order)
Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.
Your breath is fine. It's delightful, it's delicious.
Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio.
No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.
Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?
You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the "Astonishing Tales of Costanza".
Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby.
Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.
Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.
All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.
Well I thought we'd both be getting married.
Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?
(also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it.
Well we went out one time. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?
They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.
Hello? Oh, hi honey. (annoyed, weary) Yes, I told him. I'll get it. (George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry to argue with Meryl on the phone.) Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...
Im getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other line beeps) Im getting another call, see ya(answers call) Hello!
You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!
Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?
What do you mean? Why wouldn't I know his name?
You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.
Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
You can't put a paper towel on his head.
I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.
I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.
Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!
Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?
. . . All right (gritting teeth) Just give me the ticket.
My bet? All right. Ill open with a tuna sandwich.
(on phone)Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.... it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye.
Girls. There's girls right here in the store. Look, look, there's one over there. Look, there's another one. Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there. What's the matter?
He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.
So what did you do there all day?
And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry)
Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)
Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this, now she's got nothing.
They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
Y-You didnt do anything. Its not you, its me. Its- this is very difficult.
Boy, It's the way they just slip it in there too.
He feels funny. You don't have to do this.
Evry-Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. "Oh, is he good?" "Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best." They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, "You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. No, he's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher." And then there's always that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me." Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, "Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. And everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."
Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?
Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.
I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?
Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.
How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!
Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? (hands Elaine the tape recorder.)
Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.
Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.
Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now?
Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?
Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.
Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?
(pulling Leo back in) Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you.
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang"...
Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?
Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.
It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---
What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.
(Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing?
Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.
Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.
Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! (Kramer exits.)
how can u say things like that over the phone?
Shes right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, Im gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.
I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.
There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.
Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer. It shows at least he's making an effort.
Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why dont you just settle it like mature adults?
Who do you know? He knows my hair.
(under breath) Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..
Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.
Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.
Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, "Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms."
So what happened? You gave her my tax papers? ... My papers?
The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.
Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house  and then I saw it in your house.
I don't have any change. You've got any change?
Hey Doc, check this out. [does an around-the-world with the Yo-Yo]
I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!
Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?
I don't know how long this is gonna last.
Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?
How about we leave and, come back in a week?
Yeah, Im going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days.
Yeah, I took her home one night  we kinda started up a little bit in the car.
(Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?
Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.
Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.
First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, "Didn't you see my signal?" "Look at that fender!" ..Then you'd see a real fight.
Well, it was the best of those movies.
Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. (casually leaves)
Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr.
Vandelay Industries, Kel Varnsen speaking. May we help you? ... Oh Hi Keith. Na, I was just jokin' around
I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous!
Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally, yeah this is Jerry,I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and..
I cant blame you. I cant believe she never called you back.
I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.
Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.
Got it. (but now a man-hand grabs his arm) Uh!
No, I had to tell my friends  my friends didnt have to tell you.
What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.
(he hits a few keys and looks over at her) Cash advance... yes (hits a key)  no (he looks over again) balance inquiry... no (he looks again) receipt.... no (he looks again) processing... processing... (He opens the box, pulls out his money and then looks at the woman and says) I won!
You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 950, I'm not gonna be able to make it!
You didn't ... (makes motion like he's lighting a cigar)
I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, "Oh This is so good. What's in it?" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not.
Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.
I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?
(looking outside) Hey Newman, is that your red car?
Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.
Ya what was this? (HE IMITATES MOHEL'S FLINCHING)
tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.
Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy.
You can't. That's why they lose very few players.
Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...
Why would he steal a box of raisins?
Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?
He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
(thinking) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume...
So I guess , you're not getting married?
Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.
There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.
It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.
This is insane. You know, I dont even know where shes staying! She, shes not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.
No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car.
Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.
Look, you can hang out here if you want.
Well, this is it. I'm really gonna do something about my life, you know? You know, I think I'm gonna call Melanie again. So what if she shushed me. GEORGE, I am really gonna make some changes.
Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? Im sorry. I didnt mean it. I took it out on you. Were still friends. Were still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, Ill tell you what. Ive got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.
So you want me to get the books? Is that it?
Pretty good. I think she might be the one.
Ah, dinner! Thats it, youre all the way back!
Hey, guess what. I just bought my father a Cadillac
Well, we've got to do something. (grabs his phone) I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.
You know, I don't even know my IQ.
I mean I met her three times. I dont even know her last name.
If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. Hes always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess its because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.
Already? That was fast... I assume he's not a High Talker...
(fidgets like he has no room with George next to him)... Could you move over there?!
Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much. (To Kramer) I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!
(To Guard) I just wanted you to scare him.
So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?
So you're not gonna come back to New York with us?
(to Elaine) So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?
(Picks one up) Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?
Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?
The way I feel when I go places with you? (Kramer enters.) Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?
(Takes the bottle from him) Just swallow 'em.
Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. >click click click<...
Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game.
Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really.
No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?
I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.
(as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people.
He went crazy from one note. He couldnt get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??... Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women!
Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...yknow, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, its dark, theres bubbles happening, theyre all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, Cmon babe, lets go. You come by, you open up the lid and theyll- (stiffens up, as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, theyre in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, Tomorrow, the dryer, Im goin. You wait here! The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you dont see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So theyre showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isnt your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first.
You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.
Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man.
O.k., good, I'll see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.)
I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem.
Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side.
What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?
So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!
Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.
Well what am I supposed to do now?
George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long.
Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.
Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?
All right, that's enough of that. (Jerry takes the plates and hands them to a waitress.)
Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin?
You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.
No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial.
Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.
I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)
Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.
Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?
I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.
No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.
I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.
So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on me.
Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though.
Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.
So what are calling me six times a day?
(accusingly) Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.
Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" or, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" You emphasize "Jerry" or "bring."
Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)
Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.
One of the problems in life is that when youre a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, I got the front seat I wanted the front seat! I called it. And the other kid knows hes got nothing to say He called it. What can I do? If there was a Kid Court Of Law, it holds up. Your Honour, my client did ask for the front seat And the judge would go, Did he call it? Well no, he didnt call- BANG! (Jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled.
Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, "You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"
Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat)
After one date you try and improvise on her machine?
Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.
I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave.
All right, just give me a western. (unhappy)
She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.
Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.
All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?
No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?
Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? Theres Elastic Man... Plastic Man...
Wait a second. (Grabs the icebucket off the counter.) This'll scare 'em off. (Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. Jerry gets back into bed.) Well, good night, Ollie.
Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours?
(on the phone) Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye. (hangs up the phone)
It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck!
Listen, Joel. Theres something I have to tell you...
(Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! A dinosaur!
All right, what are you gonna say to him?
No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off.
(Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?
Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?
Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.
My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while.
Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.
I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.
And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.
It has nothing to do with whose house it is.
No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up?
Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.
How much could you possibly have in there?
Because you know we used to go out.
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.
Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.
I saw one once that could do sign language.
Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)
I don't think I can be that nice.
(Reasoning) You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place!
Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?
I just want a, touch em a little.
We're here discussing our script with your father.
Well how did he react when you gave it to him?
No move. So, you see, its all part of a divine plan.
Are saying you're banning me from the store?
Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.
Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?
So forget about the books. Did you read them?
(interrupting) No no it's ok. (walking Rachel out) So we'll go see Schindler's List later right?
So, Puddy, I decided Im gonna go with another 900 convertible.
No eight years isn't such a long streak.
Leo's furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at George's book) What is that doing on the table?
Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?
Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.
George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?
Get in there. (he pushes George in the direction of the restaurant)
Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, Im in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants.
They're ladies' glasses! You know all you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.
It's like we're living in the '50s here.
Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him.
Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!
Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.
That?s what I?ll do, I?ll just call him and tell him, I?ll tell him. That?s all I?ll do. He's a human being, I?ll talk to him. He'll understand. Right?
(admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.
Well, for one think, don't listen to him.
You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?
(to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello.
She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.
What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp, why do you want shade?
Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just wanted to pick it up.
So why don't they talk like that now?
You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.
Im not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll em down below my knee?
Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment.
Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.
I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating.
(To bartender) Can I have a club soda? (To Ronnie) Goin' on tonight?
Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.
Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by the big showcase tonight.
We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.
Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. If you're there it'll be a better group.
He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris.
Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?
You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.
(In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so.
Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.
In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.
Im Dan. Can I have my list back, please?
I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.
Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things about you from George.
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?
I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?
Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.
I've been waiting a while for this. You know it's a shame Tony got all banged up, we're not gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?
Are you sure he cant hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.
Aw! You'll be fine, you were in there for what , a couple of minutes.
I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting.
So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George?
(a little confused) You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables?
Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?
Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.
And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.
Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.
Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, Yeah, I got this new thing Platonic. My idea, my name, callin it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- dont do anything, and go right home. Whatd you think? I think its going to be big! I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didnt work. Yknow, I bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, Uh, Hi, uh my names Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, its a Riconic relationship.
I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?
You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?
I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
Well. This should be a very interesting evening.
(after a very awkward pause, cheerily) Hey, neighbor.
Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.
(Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not.
"Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old married couple--" *I told you that pear was washed*!
Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.
What if she's got no interest in you?
All right! I'll do it. The race is on.
I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?
(standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. (indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.
It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. "The New Yorker is stealing my ideas." ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real.
I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work.
OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers?
(taps George's chest) Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six.'
(facing the lengthening line behind him) Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.
I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that.
Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!
"Don't you see what's happened, he couldn't talk , he's wearing these shoes, he's drooling."
Ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.
No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!
Did you say, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show" or, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"? (Elaine comes over.)
Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
'51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?
What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in it's path.
I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me "C'mon Jerry, go along, go along..."
(Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.
Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.
Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket.
No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I dont know her name.
I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.
Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.
If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.
Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me.
Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set.
Let me see those. ( smells them) Oh! I know the chunky that left these Chunkies......NEWMAN!!! I've got him.
She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.
Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...
No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.
Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.
I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!
(to Rava) So, wheres this boyfriend of yours? I cant wait much longer. Ive got a flight.
I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race.
Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. (standing) I'm going to the bathroom.
I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. (Lena is puzzled.)
(watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans?
What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?
I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.
No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey)
(To Elaine) It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's unconscious.
Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.
It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
(Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
We found out his super power was lack of money.
Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle?
No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.
Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it.
Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.
And who is on the show? Who are the characters?
I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no.
The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.
(smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good.
Well, once I didnt have dinner until, like 900 oclock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage  meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya? Throw out my garbage for me.
Coach to India - The only way to go.
No economic reason for them to be here.
Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours. (And with that, Jerry made the most fatal mistake of his life)
(Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.
Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)
I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--
Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!
You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!
Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?
What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them.
Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?
All fathers are intimidating. Theyre intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, To hell with the world, I can make my own people. Ill eat whatever I want, Ill wear whatever I want, and Ill create whoever I want.
(To himself) Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over there? It's not like somebody died. It's "Beaches" for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't.
(watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this?
Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?
You gotta go to my chiropractor, hes the best.
It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a "Tada!" gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say "I'll see ya.", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)
Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.
How can I want it now, if you want it?
Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.
Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.
Good question. (More to himself than to Elaine) Why are we calling?
I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back.
So he just shaves his head for no reason?
What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.
Which part? The renovating the restaurant you dont own part or spending the two hundred million you dont have part?
You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!
Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department.
Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist.
If there's a serial killer lose in your neighborhood, it seems like the safest thing is to be the neighbor. They never kill the neighbor. The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right? "Oh, he was kind of quiet." I love these neighbors. They're never disturbed by the sounds of murdering, just stereo. Chain saws, people screaming, fine. Just keep the music down. And all these women who always fall in love with the serial killer. They write to him in prison. Here's a woman that's hard to disappoint. I guess she's only upset when she finds out he's stopped killing people and she goes "You know sometimes I feel like I don't even know who you are anymore".
So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?
Wait 'til I tell him about the book.
You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story??
Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.
The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California!
Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.
(Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah?
(livid) Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one!
Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg.
Oh, The Muted Heart. Glen Close. Sally Field. Well, that should be good.
And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?
(Trying to change the subject away from Nina) Hey - Hey Kramer, what are you doing? You want to borrow something? You want to eat something? Come on in!
Let's go out and celebrate! (they all get up)
Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?
What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)
Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.
(quietly) Hey, uh, Milos, I don't mind rolling over here, but could you lighten up on the 'not a man' stuff?
You should have her work on it for you.
My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?
Well this is a great place to sit you got here.
Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.
Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.
Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... (to himself, cursing her) Mulva!
Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over this whole operation!
You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't destroy someone else's.
Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?
Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. (Elaine smiles and rolls her eyes at him) What brings you here?
(thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.
(shouting) Kramer what am I going to do did you hear that that guy's gonna put a kibosh on me he's crazy he's out of his mind....
Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a...
Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity. 5? 3? Oh, it was just an expression. All right, well, that's very sweet of you. Okay, I'll call you later. All right, bye. Hey!
Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted.
Hey, have fun at the... family reunion. (George exits) So, what do you know about this Jack fellow?
There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of... (he cracks) Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?!
I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket.
Nothing. I'm sure "Jon" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! (Laughs uproariously.)
(tapping the spatula while waiting for waffles to be done) Any second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready.
Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus.
Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10?
The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.
John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.
You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.
I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.
Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.
Why'd you have to say anything to her?
I dont know. Its got a pink lining.
Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.
I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.
When's he leaving? (putting some items into the refrigerator)
I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.
Is there a captain's hat involved in this?
Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!
To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in, in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in "morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? fine" Ten minutes later you see him in the hall, "How ya doin'?" Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow "Hey" You start coming up with nicknames for them. "Jimbo."
Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.
Hmm, I really need to speak with him.
So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?
YEAH? (speaking loudly so the visitor can hear him through the intercom)
How about when Harrison Ford jumped out of that plane, and he was shooting back at them as he was falling?
Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?
So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.
Yeah, that's a deal. That's a terrible deal. I don't want to go out to dinner with him. Id rather make my own suit.
All right Ramon, Im going to get going.
Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to go?
I cant believe it! This guy ripped me off!
Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, that?s not fair, what about George, Susan and Elaine, what do you need me for?
Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good things.
Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer enters)
Hey, it's one thing if I asked you "Could you do me a favor?" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE (Obviously up to something. Jerry doesn't suspect anything - yet) Whey you told me what you went through on the plane, it makes you stop and think. You appreciate having a real friend.
You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.
That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?
Good shake. Perfect shake. Single pump, not too hard, you know, doesn't have to prove anything, but, you know, firm enough to know he was there.
Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.
But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.
Well, we need change and all I have is twenties.
Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without.
I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?
No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.
Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the check to Elaine) look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.
Alright. (Approaches host) Excuse me, this is your party, right?
I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club.
Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.
(Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.
"Just one....gotta go back.....Oh but get this. Elaine, you will appreciate this. I'm sitting in Tim Whatley's waiting room...He's got a Penthouse right out on the table."
I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.
What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?
It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.
Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about it!
I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.
(to the Drake) Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. (To Elaine) Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?
(to Kramer) So how's your karate class going?
Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?
(Interrupting Bania) Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.
Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!
I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.
Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way.
Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing. Perhaps it's an homage.
Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.
Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.
Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?
All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.
Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me (flustered, he indicates a nose pick)
Aah, top of the fridge. Hey George, I'm taking that waitress to the Tony's.
Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???
she's one of these people, always have to be different
All right, so youre chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead.
I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.
No, see, we didnt have ponies. Im sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..
So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?
No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.
(What's goin' on,) like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--
You told me that already like two months ago.
(realising) Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. It belongs to the Friars Club.
Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out...
It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library
So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.
All right. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle Arbys no more than once a month. And in exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game, and doesnt read a book.
I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
I don't know Kramer, ahh, my concern is that ....
Where did you come up with all that stuff?
It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?
Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to Elaine)
Yeah. Specifically 930 shows. Seen any good 930 shows at the Paragon, Willie?
Why don't you see what you can do?
I didnt know what the coma etiquette was.
You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldnt expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.
He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.
I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.
Oh, its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.
All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.
Pam? What do you care? (Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying a Brentano's bookstore bag.)
Expecting Newman? That's funny because I just happened upon him down at the Kenny Roger's Roasters.
It's Kramer isn't it? I knew it!  The greasy door knob the constant licking of the fingers, he's hooked to the chicken isn't he?
So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out Im giving you a raise.
Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.
We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.
What's going on here. How is that possible?
Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?
It was the single worst moment of my life.
Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.
Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.
So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian...
I'll tell you what happened. We got married.
Thank you very much, that's great- >click< Oh! Hold on a sec, I got a call on the other line. >click click< Hello?
And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table)
All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.
But you know... not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me.
Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone)
I have an idea. (Elaine enters; to Elaine) We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three.
Yeah have a couple of pieces, weak, weak gum yeah
Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.
I was hoping you'd offer. (The intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to.
Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place.
Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!
You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.
What do you mean you don't think so?
Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.)
Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.
(To George) You're off bread. (To Elaine) So what happened is it over?
(Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 'French Impressionist Paintings'?
I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.
What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it.
Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer!
Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go?
Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.
You did not tell me not to sell.
Ill have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?
I dunno, watch it on TV I guess. Why?
I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.
Oh why don't you go sleep over at Newman's.
All I said was "I like the pen".
Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place.
You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it.
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!
Okay, take it easy. (hangs up) That was Keith. we're going to do something next week.
(yelling) Yes I told him the Packyderm story!
Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over my side.
I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.
So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?
So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City. I'm performing at Bally's.
No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.
(to Kramer) It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Wheres she gonna get five thousand? She doesnt have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. Shes gone. Then you come in, Why dont you loan her five thousand? What do you care? Youve got five thousand. Give her five thousand!
(yelling) Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.
I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.
Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.
"Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!"
All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry.
Elaine, how about this shirt? Is this okay?
Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guys out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, its true, men hear a drill, its like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, Honey, I think Jims working on something over there. So they run over to the guy. Now they dont actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. Thats what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, What are you using, a Phillips-head? You know, we feel involved. Thats why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, thats just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they dont cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, thatll hold.
(To Assistant) Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.
Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.
Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.
Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. Im sure theyd just as soon give it to you, but youd have to come up with that money.
About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?
Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay... is uh...
'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off the table.
Well, I am sure I had a good reason.
What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage death match.
I mean it's a terrible mistake, I mean he thinks I ruined some deal of his at NBC, I don't know anything about any deal at NBC.
(still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.
My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? (to the intercom)
You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West? Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.
I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
George, I am loving this no wallet thing.
See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey George, look, I'm not funny now.
Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.
Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-
Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I?
I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...
When did you get tickets to see that?
Hey what about Dr. Resnick My Uncle Leo is going to see him tomorrow .
So, how did you get up there? Did you say you had to use the bathroom?
Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is.
George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.
It's a cigar store Indian. (to Elaine) Read the card.
What are you talkin about? Its fine, I love having you here.
So, where do you want to eat tonight?
O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!
All right, lets go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.
Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?
(sarcastically) Yeah, Levine. And Im Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.
There's girls everywhere. I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator. They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?
Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.
(Nodding) I think you may have something there.
Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this.
When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.
Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.
Well, whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.)
Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go.
(Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!
Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.
(examining) Hey George, you know what? I think this crest is different. It's got a moose on it.
What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time
Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.
You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?
Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.
(Like a little kid) But, I don't want to be a pirate!
Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Just give me a little squeeze.
That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it. (throws watch in garbage)
No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.
Hey. How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?
Schumann. (George stops himself, frightened. Jerry looks around the lobby.) Where are they?
Ahh, too bad you got a little, George Costanza thing going on.
Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.
What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back.
You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner.
Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--
Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.
I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need "the clown" in his title, as clown? Bozo, "the" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...
"Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable..." Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been "outed"! I wasn't even "in"!
(Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) It'll be on your conscience.
Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's got this strangest habit. She eats her peas one at a time. You've never seen anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. I mean, we've had dinner other times. I've seen her eat Corn Niblets. But she scooped them.
Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.
Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.
Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there.
How many session did my parents paid for?
(downcast) No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
George, I want you to promise me something. If Im ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.
Why dont they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, Just Back. All back; No front. You walk in the front, youre immediately in the back. (Jerry picks up a tie display, and shakes it rhythmically from left to right.) Look, Elaine, tie carwash.
I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" thing.
Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress.
You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.)
Um, who do I make it out to?
Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?
have some more, take some for the road.
Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?
yeah without a doubt, I'm down (Kramer enters) oh hey how're you doing? Jane this is my neighbor Kramer
Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?
I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.
Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?
Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino.
If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.
People dont turn down money. Its what separates us from the animals.
No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.
(still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)
oh I'm sorry I didn't get most of that.. isn't that Kramer over there?
and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!
You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it)
I dont return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.
There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it..
Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.
To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go "Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch." According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.
No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.
What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!
(to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?
You stink. You know you stink. What is this?
Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.
"Did you notice he always refer to himself in the third person. Jimmy can dunk. Jimmy's new in town. Jimmy we'll see you later."
Good, as a matter of fact. I almost had my own show in Japan.
Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?
Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.
What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?
Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing?
Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.
'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'.
So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?
We dont understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you cant stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I dont see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, lets make up our mind where we think theyre going.
(turning to each other) I dont know. Hes an importer.
Jenna's like me. She's very... (searches for word)
You were livin' in the village then, right?
George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman!
Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.
I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?
(rising) I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the speed-dial.
He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly . I would like to have a good show.
No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?
What happened to the jacket. Did he take it with him?
No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.
Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.
All right, go, it's a race! Come on!
Yeah. Im having a wonderful time. (it's obvious he isn't)
What did you do the rest of the day?
I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.
Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee)
Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!
I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.
Especially that big kid up in the front. (Mr. Pitt is shown on the television, trying to hold up the deflating Woody balloon.) How old is he? (The phone rings.) Hello?
Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?
Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa.
Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog strangler. (George leans close) would you suck a mint or something. Can I come right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where we are. Where are we?
Well, it has nothing to do with you.
Oh yeah? I dont believe youve seen... this.
Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?
Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.
(Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-
... I just got a postcard from Elaine?
Nope, the cop says its my word against his. Theres nothing they can do.
So he's been lying to me for two months?!
So you say she was on a horse?
Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestl's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--
So Marcelino's going to take down the check?
(Thinking) What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship. Gotta relax.
I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce you get impeached and you're not even the president!
"Of course.... But that's got nothing to do with it."
(picks up the phone on the coffee table) 555-3455. Well wait a second, don't you see that's 555-FILK.
Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.
Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?
(determined) I wanna join. I need it to become a member.
He was down at the other end. So he yells out, "Ready, On your mark, Get set, " and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.
You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin them whenever I want!
Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!
Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?
It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.
I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.
Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination? You couldn't possibly visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life size snotty puppet. I guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. That's the end of the line for a mannequin. "What ever happened to Bob?" "Have you seen that new Volvo commercial? He's got a bulls eye right in his face." Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, I guess these are the two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves. Well dressed or getting killed. I'm sure there is some pro-mannequin organization that doesn't even like you to use the term mannequin. "Hey they're not mannequins, they're the life deprived."
I got one problem. Youre keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that shes coming.
Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.
What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty minutes of 'So, who's from out of town?'
Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?
(A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.
I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?
So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.
I know exactly whats gonna happen tonight. Im gonna try and act like Im not impressed, hes gonna see right through it.
Well, well, why are you getting rid of your refrigerator? (he gets up from the table and carries a dish into the kitchen)
No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.
Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.
Oh (laughing) Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting.
Im just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.
Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time.
I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.
...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry.
But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?
All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura opens the door and gets out). What? What?
She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply)
And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.
Sure. See, things always even out for me.
George, here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!
So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...
(suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.
It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook?
So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.
I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.
The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke. (The phone rings.) Thats probably Uncle Leo.
Well, I brought them up there to take his records--
So I dont know what shes using it for.
People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?
You know it and I ditched all my junk food.
To wash my hands. Theyre sticky from the orange.
Oh, no. Its not that I dont think you can. I know that you cant, and Im positive that you wont.
Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!
Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. ! Celebrate! How about some champagne?
I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.
Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?
Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.
(walking away) Well, I didn't sleep with her.
Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention, Elaine laughs) Maybe it's time you got a different hobby.
(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
You know what? That was the amazing thing.
Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.
Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.
I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
Oh and I've got some things of yours here.
Elaine? What does she have to - (notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.) Oh no...
I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.
And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking?
I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.
Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I'm sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.
How could she not tell me where she was staying?
No, no. Still doin the big sweep across.
Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.
Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral?
See...women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel...
Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?
Not our "all the way", their "all the way." I got the stink of responsibility on me.
Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)
Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?
(proud to Peggy, under his breath) Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. (winks)
Great, its yours. I can't stand the sight of it. Elaine, heres the car keys. (tosses her the keys)
Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser.
Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.
You think they have fleas there, don't you?
Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.
Oh! man did you see that. I ate discarded food.
I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?
Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.
Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--
So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.
Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?
Coincidence? This guys in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment?
Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those orange cones you have on the throughway... (Sees pilot) on the way... up here... um... I..
(adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.
Kramer, (Trying to pass him) get outta my way!
Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.
No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 1030.
"The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour". I'm confused.
Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.
Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.
Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document.
Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?
There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?
Inka-dink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink.
Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.
Oh, nothing happened, you know, but is was great.
Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here...
But you made it through the day before.
No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.
He doesn't even care if a man answers.
Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours.
Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at no more than three miles an hour.
(thinking) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft... (to Vanessa) Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit.
I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.
What do you think the worst part of being blind is?
We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
Aaa. Well ... you want something to eat, don't you?
Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. and we got to talking, he sells Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.
I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, "This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here."
Is it...? Could it...? Could he have...? IT IS! (Grabs Kramer.) Poppie peed on my sofa!!
I was kind of um (pauses) making out.
I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.
You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.
I was. But, shes got me, like, hypnotized.
I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.
Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.
That's funny, that's funny! "I'm sick of cleaning." That's very funny.
It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.
Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?
Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?
So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?
Hey, lll just keep swimming. Hey, hey. Im not done. I know what you're up to Ramon. Because Im a member here, this is my place to swim.
Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)
May I see you outside for a moment please?
C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one.
Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another mistake.
I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg." But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, "Would you mind?!"
You're out of your mind you know that.
How long has your car been sitting in the Yankee parking lot?
Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?
More cereal? that's your third bowl today, you had it for breakfast and lunch.
Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!
(continuing to pack) That's a nice four seconds.
You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that.
(Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.
You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. And you can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. Then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin' Alright, gimme everything you have, too''.
As a guy I dont know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I dont know how to say, Bill, I feel I need to see other men. Do you know what I mean? Theres nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think thats the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because theyre two guys. Thats almost all we need to have in common. Cause sports  sports and women  is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, So, whats in the refrigerator?
Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.
I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.
Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it.
That is so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood horse?
There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?
(pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?
I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.
I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright*, I forgive you...
Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. Alright, it's time to go. Come on.. Up.
I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.
Don't you see what's goin' on here???... No boxers, no Jockeys...
Yeah. a-hu. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?
Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something.
How 'bout if it was something like " I can't find my receipt my place's a stye.
So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.
That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's.
Got 'em on the street, from a scal... (catches himself again)
I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.
You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand?
(picking up the phone and dialing) It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.
There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a "Smell Gestapo". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush...
George, I didnt sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. Im just going to be honest. Thats all... Yes, Im nervous... Are you listening to me?... Just put some soap on your finger. Itll slide right off... Then try axle grease... (Kramer enters; to the phone) Ill call you back after I talk to her... Bye.
An inch! Can you move over an inch?!?
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie.
I dont give out bites. I got another one. But Im saving it for later.
alright I changed my mind, uh yeah I don't think I'm not gonna go now
Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together.
So write a letter.. move to another...move to Staten Island., 'lot easier to blend in a sea of people in Staten Island than China believe me.
Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually do it)
Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, "Make sure you hang on to your jacket."
Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your..
I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.
Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.
A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.
Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?
Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something.
No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald cure.
That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.
There you go. That'll get you home in time.
Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something.
(To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.
What happened to your head when you got hit?
What happened to you? You were going like a hundred miles an hour.
It's not that bright orange one is it?
It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look (searches for word) stupid. (to salesman) I'm sorry.
Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?
(to the Barneys sales associate) Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?
Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerrys office. (Elaine is looking confused). Were going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean hes already left?
Yeah, I blamed it on you. Hi Tim.
It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it.
Oh, Im sorry. Im just waiting for someone.
Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday.
Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.
You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do.
Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?
I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin else.
(extemporising) That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go.
Yeah Ive got this old bottle of cough medicine.
Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!
Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?
Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it.
Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it.
Yeah, but how could you be so sure?
(dialing) He got em out of the house.
Damn, I was too overanxious, he must have noticed that.
I didnt know. Kramer told me about the worlds.
It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ...
She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?
I think the thing I admire most about the Chinese is that they're hanging in there with the chopsticks. Because, if you think about it, you know, they've seen the fork... by now. I'm sure they've seen the spoon, they're going, "Yeah, yeah, they're OK... We're going to stay with the sticks." I mean, I don't know how they've missed it, thousands of years ago, Chinese farmer gets up, has his breakfast with the chopsticks, goes out and works all day in the field with a shovel... Hello?... Shovel! Not going out there ploughing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues.
Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners.
Well I think I get the gist of it.
Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener - what other conclusion could one reach? (The phone rings.)
(smiling) Really? That's great. You said that to him?
Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later.
Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
(Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell smoke?
I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?
Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--
What do you think it could've been just some dude?
All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.
Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.
You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!
An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. (Elevator doors open) Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. (Everyone but Jerry is now in the elevator. Jerry's still addressing them) Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?! (Elevator doors shut. A few people in the hallway are looking at him, he turns and addresses them) I am not an animal!
Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.
Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper of the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack . . .
How can I ever have you over? Youll sit there moping.
I was ready to get jiggy with it.
Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure there are many people who do not like me.
(out of window) George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!
Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.
Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.
And I don't want you to hold mine!
This stuff on top is my friends. Could I get it done in a separate machine?
No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.
You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world "I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable." (George is baffled)
I dont bother with him. Hes been calling me for seven years. Ive never called him once! Hes got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if hes paying attention.
Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?
Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.
It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry?
I think I offended the wake-up guy...! (worried)
Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.
I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?
Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.
So are you gonna get him a chair?
Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from ourselves. That's what you said.
Yeah, but why would you... (Kramer is eating a peach then disgusted he spits it out) Bad peach?
Does it ever bother you that this organization-
Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys.
No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.
George, I've been sick all week. Elaine was too. Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes. Do the math. Yeah, maybe I will get out. Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first. Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something. Yeah, Selwyn's. Okay bye.
No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-
I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
(stands, puzzled, it's not sinking in) W-what do you mean?
And youre sure the floss was the catalyst?
I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?
I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer?
Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents.
Why did you force that mint on me? I told ya I didn't want the mint!
It's this one here in the back. (Tilts his head back, and knocks Elaine's trophy out the window. A loud hissing sound and commotion is heard from the street below. Everyone runs to the windows to look.)
I don't need a personal trainer. (Kramer comes in) all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.
No, but he's not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR)
Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...
Thats not too bad. Its not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me.
I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldnt do that.
No, "yada yada" is good. She's very succinct.
Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought.
Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.
I'll go if someone else drives. You going?
First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.
Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.
Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?
I was going to say, "Being a good host."
Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone.
Well how long you are going to keep this up?
Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. (pause) Did you?
Oh, no, uh, go ahead. You got a pen?
I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.
Yeah, Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would you describe Kramer's hair?
I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.
Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?
Aren't you going to take the check down?
Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.
Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.
Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?
She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.
What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?
(TO GEORGE, REWOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?
"Naaaaaa...I can't watch a man sing a song."
(interrupts)like a shark fisherman with a bucket of (?) Ch....
I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...
I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the plot. It's embarrassing. It's an embarrassment to have to admit, but I'm the one that you see in the parking lot after the movie talking with his friends, going, "Oh, you mean that was the same guy from the <beginning>... Ohhhhhhhhhh..." Nobody will explain it to you. When you're in the theater, you can't find out. [whispering to imaginary friends seated around him] "Why did they kill that guy?... Why did they kill him?... Who was that guy? What was the... I thought he was with them? Wasn't he with them? Why would they kill him if he was with them? Oh, he wasn't *really* with them.... I thought he was with them. It's a good thing they killed him.''
Where did I take it? Where Did I Take It? (stabbing a knife into a cutting board) Umm, to that place on, uh Columbus and 85th. Okay?
Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?
(Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that line?
Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?
We won. Were in the finals on Wednesday.
(Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.
Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.
You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.
Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye.
They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.
You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.
Why didn't you just ask her for it?
All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.
No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy.
Have you said anything to her about it?
No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.
I'll pick you up at your apartment. We'll go to the Eight.
Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night.
No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe it. I lost him. That stupid idiot. Now what are we going to do?
Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.
You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.
Good evening, folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--
I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table.
Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.
The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go "Excuse me, I think you missed a spot."
What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.
Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house?
Hey look at this. What is going on here?
Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?
No, I don't want that smell in the house.
(mind's voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?
Kramer, they're fumigating. There's toxic gas in there.
Its raining? Its raining. The game will be postponed. Well play tomorrow.
You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.
Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late.
Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?
That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without the cushy timeslot.
You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.
Anyway Beth, you know i was thinking on my way over how when i was 9. I wanted these handball sneakers, they were all black but they came in adult sizes so you know i never got the sneakers. (Beth looks him confused)
How many times you been out with him?
Um, you know, its the damnedest thing. It went away.
Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.
Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?
George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
Ya, that's the.. last thing you want to see. Well, next to last.
Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
(Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.
I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)
Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?
Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist enters Monk's)
(To Nina) Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy, huh?
Im takin it, Im takin the place. Im gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. Im livin here...Im movin.
"Hey, by the way, did you ever call that guy from the health club.?"
How ya doing? (George nods) Can't talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his brace) Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his eyebrows) I like that. (George sticks his tongue out) So how's life without tonsils? (George quickly indicates with his arm that he wants ice cream) What? What's that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?.. (George signals that it's more) Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy.. (George motions for ice cream again) What are you doing?
40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?
(seeing that Kramer has a new watch) What's that?
They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.
Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?
What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.
But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.
You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.
I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there.
Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?
I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...
The Improv is playing "Rochelle Rochelle" The musical.
(To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.
I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? Thats what I want to know. I mean, its the championship, Im hitting everything.
Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy. You don't have to mention the bubble boy? I know about the bubble boy. I'm aware of the bubble boy. Why do you keep reminding me about the bubble boy?
Religion, my friend, thats what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that its going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.
Uh huh. Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?
Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?
But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.
Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.
Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?
(picking at his moustache) You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.
Hey, I thought you went to the game.
Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?
George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments.
That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is.
All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. She's at CALVIN KLEIN's right now.
Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.
Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.
No good. Too many people know the combination.
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer, say it isn't so.
That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?
No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?
All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape.
My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.
(defensive) At least it was just the handle!
Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.
(to the phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)
Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it?
That's it! No more questions! I don't care!
Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.
Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!
So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!" So he says to me, "What are ya gonna do about it?"
Ive been thinking about asking this girl Im, uh, seeing-
Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...
It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.
He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!
Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?
No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.
Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune.
[forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell out of here!
It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.
Of course I want to talk about it.
To the Paul Simon concert in the park!
So youre saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, its all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.
So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?
you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?
Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?
Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So...
Actually, yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!
This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.
All right. (opens door - Red light floods hallway - a buzzing sound emanates.)
Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?
Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?
I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers.
Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.
I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.
Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.
What do I say if he picks up?
Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.
So you want to catch a movie later?
Youre gonna get back together, anyway. Its thousands of dollars!
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?
Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.
...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.
Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.
Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry won't let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesnt that bother you?
Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. (Kramer goes to get the suit. Elaine enters.)
No you go on ahead, I'll take the bus.
I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...
Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - theyre doing sign language now.
So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is better?
Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough.
Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.
He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?
I don't understand what the big deal is.
Hell have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?
Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know, we can't go anywhere near there.
(naked, carrying a belt sander) I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.
Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!
What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?
A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning..
I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've been so helpful.
Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.
(Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key?
Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.
to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?
Aww, right. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it!
Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease?
That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.
All right. Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot. (hangs up)(to George) Casting tomorrow at NBC. 400. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful. (George looks disappointed)
Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...
Hi. Hi Winona. Nice to see you again.
I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.
Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad.
What is it she think you can't do?
(thinking) I cant believe it. I got nothing! I dont even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...
Yeah, yeah, take care of it. (Jerry throws her some toilet paper) Come on, George, what is it?
You're lying! You got it, I want that number!
The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the other -person.
I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.
I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.
How come? I told you - It's fantastic.
Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strange the whole flight?
I'll get you another one just like it!
Oh, no. I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with it.
What is that? (Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.)
That orange dress is burned in my memory
Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. Weve been doing this silly, dumb voice.
You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars.
There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.
I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?
Alright.. (Heads for the door, grabbing his coat)
I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
Well, if I hear an anguished "oink", I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look (HE POINTS AT PASSERBY) Human, human, human... (HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR, WITH ALARM.) (WITH MOCK ALARM) Wait a second! (Grabs Kramer)
I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.
I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.
Well, I don't think I want to date a protg whose mentor is a Costanza.
What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?
But you did actually throw his coat out the window.
George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say,kookie talk.
People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression 'The best revenge is living well' I've said this, in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice, doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him, 'Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting, french doors, a divan. That'll show those punks.'
Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on.
I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.
We'll see about that. (Runs to the window and shouts up to Kramer, who's on the roof.) Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win!
Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!
W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?
I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal?
Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?
So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.
O.K. from now on I want you to call me "Jerry the Great".
(putting on his coat to go downstairs, he finds the key in his coat pocket) I believe this belongs to you.
(Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.
So I know this guy. Im getting all my sneakers at a discount now.
Yknow what? This is not that bad an idea.
No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses!
Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.
On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?
What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I dont even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. Thats what I want. I want an admission of guilt.
At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.
Theres the giant ball of oil. Clares right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!
(hands up) I don't want it that way.
(turning on the commercial) Right, quiet dignity. As opposed to, say, this?
How would you describe the smell in this house?
(sarcastically) Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.
I thought you just said she doesn't know??
Im supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?
Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of deadbeats.
(to the phone) Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my moneys gone... Well, call me right back. (Jerry hangs up.) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasnt been home or in his office in the past three days!
Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom.
Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort?
Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up(?). Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.
The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves)
Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents.
So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!
(Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.
I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that couldn't be.
Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) Thats it. Done!
Kramer! (tries to hide he's upset and jealous)
You don't even know what a write off is.
I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.
Yeah, but this is different , this is like ,you know, semi digested food stuff. You know the next stop is the stomach and you can take it from there.
You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?
I don't know, but you don't have it.
Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here.
Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money?
Make sure you get this area here, where he needs the help....
I dont know. He said hed call back.
I feel terrible. (Kramer smiling) I mean, Ive seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I cant go any further, but... Shes just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I cant breathe. Its like a drug.
(pointedly) Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars.
No, no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts.
Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?
(animated) You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I...
(Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat.
When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.
No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
I think we might have one left in the stock room.
No Elaine he's normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York.
Cops eating Milanos. What crazy town is this?
Okay, how about this I'm in my apartment, you come in.
Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!
(Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven!
I think that would be a very nice gesture.
You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!
She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.
So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.
Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.
Go look at your face in the mirror.
Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series.
Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because moneys a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you dont care about money when youre hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, youre like the ruler of an empire. More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives. Then after the meal, you know, youve got the pants open, youve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. Theyre mystified by the check. What is this? How could this be? They start passing it around the table, Does this look right to you? Were not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?
(bewildered) Why would she try and kill you?
I bought you a Cadillac. (hands over the keys) Here you go.
Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!
You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!
Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches)
I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.
Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.
You guys both have class at the same time?
No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?
Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
My stomach, I , think it was that cookie.
Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?
Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!
(pointing at the operation he mouths the words) Did it go in?
Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment. How 'bout I make it up to you with dinner?
How long did you leave it up there?
Well, I-I-I told my wife not to bring it.
Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?
Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.
I don't know if they have land guys.
Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?
How am I going to live with myself?!
Excuse me. (Gets up and answers the door.) Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!
(Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.
How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?
You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
Sample? (under his breath) Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book.
Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?
Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?
We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.
Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.
Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately.
(Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) I didn't say anything.
(in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.
What! You're the one who ruined her life.
I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.
You're passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago!
Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?
They sealed him up with the mint inside.
Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.
Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, its with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I mightve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.
Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.
I didnt open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.
I don't think the network will go for it.
If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught.
We're in the middle of a discussion here.
(While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands him a nickel)
Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh...
(answering, quickly) If you know what happened in the Met game, dont say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, Im sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no
Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.
It's over there. I know where it is.
So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. Its a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and Im supposed to feel bad. Is that the way its supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldnt you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. Cause its not easy to give someone the toe, youve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... (Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) Look at that toe, buddy. (He puts his foot down.) I mean, thats really insulting to get the toe, isnt it?
Look I really don't know what they're plans are.
Why didn't you come up with your own?
Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!
It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes the door) Give me that back.
Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese. (buys a newspaper out of a machine)
Hello,  oh hi Elaine .. what's going on  no he just left  you broke up with him?  ME TOO .. what happened?  oh smoking you know you're like going out with C. Everet Coope  me  nah  I couldn't go through with it  I just didn't feel ready  so what are you doing now?  Oh, great idea, I'll meet you there in like thirty minutes. Okay bye.
Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George "Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again."
What, theres something wrong with Loni Anderson? (pause) Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it.
Of course I was getting you a note.
Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up.
Youre already moping! Would you take the place?
(hands it to him as he asks ELAINE) So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?
I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.
What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what they're saying.
Kramer you're going to have to face her some time
Why don't you go out? It's nice out.
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?
Why don't you go to another nail shop?
Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.
Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going "Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going."
How'd you expect to get out of here?
(startled - eyes wide open) Hello, is somebody there? (scurrying sound) Mr.- Mr. Marbles?
(places two slices of bread against Kramer's face) That is close.
No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.
You know I dont get that whole suicide machine. Theres no tall buildings where these people live? They cant wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?
I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.
Vanessa, thank you. Ive been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.
(reading on) "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-"
"What are you doing that for, you got a job"
(Hands him some mail) There you go. Merry Chirstmas!
A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.
I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. (Slams the door on Newman's face. Then tries to delay talking to Newman by keeping the conversation with George going) So, you want a protein shake, or something?
Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop, clip clop. They're nuts for it.
Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin?
You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.
Sure. (points at booth) How about this one?
He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.
Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts, so he killed him.
(Joking around) Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.
Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.
(Threatening tone) So, listen, Puddy. When we first started this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you want to play hard ball, I got my friend, George, here, and he can play pretty hard ball. (Leaving the negotiation to George) George, vein it up.
I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!
Could you at least get a hat for me?
Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!
Oh, the sisters (he sits at the table)
Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.
No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.
No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.
Yeah thats a good deal -- you win the Pennant with that trade, hair for phlegm.
Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.
Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye.
Dont you think she woulda heard I was there?
(To Amy) Aha! So it's true! You were making out with him!
Course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.
Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.
Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.
Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. (opens the fridge and gets a bottle of water.)
You want to go to Mendys, Ill take you to Mendys.
(Resisting) Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I-I can't wear this!
The average person in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.
Come on. Something's on your mind. Out with it.
No. So, we're still on to see uh, Firestorm tonight?
Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please leave.
So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?
Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?
I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special treatment.
Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard.
Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.
Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in!
She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was "Beaches" for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?
Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!
Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?
Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see her tonight.
I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!
That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!
No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.
He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything.
You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...
Well put something down, youre taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac and Artie, theyre all coming over here before the wedding?
What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming "There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!" And then, when they all run into the other direction, we'll jump in the car!
No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.
Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.
If I see her, what do I say that Im doing here in the building?
(Gestures to his forehead) Youre getting that vein again.
Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign.
You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?
I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.
Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.
Oh! my god. What the hell is this? ..... Don't tell me.......Velvet!!!
It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.
Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...
Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)
Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.
No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.
Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal.
I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!
(sits on the back of the couch) Oh my god.
What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead.
What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?
Do you even know what this scene is about?
Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if its done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels!
Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?
(Continuing reading) "The Human Fund. Money for people."
So it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato.
Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.
It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.
No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.
youre a real pleasure. (Jerry is being sarcastic)
No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!
By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, "Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me." But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?
And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.
Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years.
Look at this, my ankle's all bitten up.
I'm saying "get the hell outta there"! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call, Jean-Paul! A wake-up call!
Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!
You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?
How come you're eating your peas one at a time?
Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.
Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.
(proud of himself) Remember me? I said I 'd come back with someone and I did. Surprised?.
Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?
By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks.
"You find you need to use a lot of obscenities at the dentist.
The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.
I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes.
I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.
You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?
oh you think she's Erika, the phone sex woman
Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump across.
Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.
Hello is this Alicia? .This is Jerry Seinfeld.
It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.
This has 'international incident' written all over it.
Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs phone up)
Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too.
Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Caf Latte?
Im not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want.
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!
If my father was moving this hed had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (as his father) 'Have you got your end?...Your ends got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your ends got to come down.'
Its great! It speeds up the intimacy level. Its like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish (snaps his fingers) three days.
And you didnt even hear how she sounded.
I think if ones going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. Its common courtesy. I dont know. Thats just the way I was brought up.
Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?
Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?
(to George) I mean, come on. (a thought occurs) No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from *Seals and Croft*.
Kramer, do you realize what's going on here? Do you know why you're here?
I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket)
It had fat in it, it's not good for you.
Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!
(Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So, the last person in should close the door!
(To himself) Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. (George doesn't react) What's the matter?
I dont know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I cant decide.
Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess youre not going in anymore.
Theres one thing I dont understand. Why does it please you? (to the phone) George Costanza, please.
So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the Spokes model category?
Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.
Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?
Yeah, big missing goin' on (spreads arms wide)
Hey, not bad. (pointing to crest) I kinda like this little thing here.
I don't believe this. (They run into theater)
Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?
Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number.
Now, I should tell you that, at this point, she's under the impression that youre - a - ah
(ranting) I can't believe how a little thing like George going too fast - and my whole weekend is gone - the plans, the packing, ... everything.
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
(animated) They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!
She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love!
(TO GEORGE) Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?
(tearing through his laundry bag) Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on, let's go.
First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.
(quickly moves over toward Matthew) What the *beep*(fuck) are you doing? You little piece of *beep*(shit)!
So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head.
I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!
Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. (pretends to pull hair out)
I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!
Listen to this "I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."
....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant? Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it in there by helicopter, you know keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. "We got the hair but I think we lost the Zest." ....rejects the transplant with organs. Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . Guy just standin' there and suddenly... ..Bink! ( motions hair flying out of his head)........lands in someone's frozen yogurt.
It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.
(worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!
Kramer!? (grabbing Kramer's arm roughly, pulling him back as he's about to knock)
Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?
How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?
All right, all right, I?ll wear this. It's bad enough I?ve got to go to the opera I?ve got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here.
I'll call back, thank you. (hangs up the phone) He went to South America!
I know. He got the hit in game SIX. So, so then what happened?
All right. You know this girl Clare I am seeing?
No kidding. (thinking) Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!
You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!
Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.
Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.
(grabbing the list from Kramer) You're not getting any plantains.
Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.
Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips.
Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend.
Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit?
So, are you gonna go out with her?
(Reading it) "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." - What is that?
(into phone) Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. (to George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!
Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do?
The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.
Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women.
I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.
"I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery."
Hey, thanks a lot for lettin' me stay here.
I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going "I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?
Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your guy?
All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.
Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off that sign?
What is this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesnt fit him).
Right in the head! (leans in and points at Testikov)
Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this?
(weary) Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out?
No, but ah, seen any good movies lately?
You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while, no matter how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because they're crawling , crawling on your skin. Up your legs , up your spine , up your back.....
"Wait a second ..Where you wearing those shoes in the cab?"
I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)
Hey, I've been back four days, I want my mail.
Hey look ,you know, you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here. You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me.
What are you doing? You're choking me. Elaine!
Oh, about the... uh (Jerry pretend to wash his hands)
He's... trying to get something off his chest.
Well, you want your organizer back don't you?
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.
(pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you lay it out on the bed.
Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it.
(Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.
Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?
Lean your head back. Open your mouth! (Grabs Kramer's head) Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!
Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..
(Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.
Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!
Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.
Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...
Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.
Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want? You're not a part of society.
The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?
He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.
Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you.
[mockingly] "Please hurry". Look at you. Look at what you've become.
So you just did the opposite of everything?
Aah! .. right. The ones from Oregon that are only ripe for two weeks a year..
No, it's tarragon. Hey Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had about you having my apartment keys and everything.
Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?
All right, she said she couldnt find a decent hotel room...
They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing."
And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!
Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit.
They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
Y-You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set!
They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.
Oh, no, no, no, wait a second, wait a second th-th-that--
That's the last babka. They got the last babka.
How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? Wha, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just sit there going, "Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh, no, another headcase!"
Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.
Well, I painted my apartment again. Ive been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, its a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize its just the thickness of the paint, but Im aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, its closer and closer. I dont even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. Thats where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control... Thats why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching TV. Thats why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there.
402? (Checks his wristwatch) Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup!
Ah, I should have got the egg white omelet.
While you were in jail. So you're free.
(moving over to block the door) Where are you going?
Ma! Ma! MAAA! (Hangs up the phone in disgust.) Oh, ahhhh (sighs quietly)
I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?
Oh, excuse me... Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.
Ill call Kramer. He can check my house.
Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.
Hey. It's you! (pointing) Th..that's my Friars Club jacket!
Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.
Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.
We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.
Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.
You really used to have a think full head of hair.
Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?
Quone? No, Im afraid that Im going to have to challenge that.
I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
Yea. (pulls at the t-shirt) This is Golden Boy's son Baby Blue.
Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner?
Come on, take them. You could take Bonnie.
You promise you'll never come in here again?
Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?!
So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?
You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial.
Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.
Hey you know we were just talking about you.
Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.
I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.
What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?
The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like youre always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. Youre out somewhere with people, Gee, you look pregnant.. are you? Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, thats not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Lets take this whole scene again. People, think about what youre saying!
(Still pulling on Kramer's pants from the ankles) Man these are tight. (Yanking) Squinch your hips in
Well my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.
Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.
(leaving the room) I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much.
A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?
Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.
(to the Drake) So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome... (to Elaine) They loved the TV, *loved* it!
Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.
Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.
And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great! (he starts to install the table)
You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.
So tonight are you going to make the move?
Whats the difference?! Thats the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!
You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry?
Good. And Ill tell you what... You dont have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.
Oh, o.k. (Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.)
Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.
Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?
Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 1130.
My honest opinion, I think she made it up.
You know, Kramer's gonna clean up on this place.
Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.
Well, its a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno...
No, I dont eat dinner. Dinners for suckers.
Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?
What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I would've done, if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!!
Here he is... that's the guy! (rolls up window) No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!
The one Puddy screamed at in the car?
(Being frank) Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.
Good idea. (phone's ringing, goes to it) (muttering) There's a beach towel on the rack.. (to phone) Yeah.
Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.
Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..
..And then she starts talking about her panties.
I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.
Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.
It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.
Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.
Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?
Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.
You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?
I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a "magical world" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.
Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.
If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.
Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!
Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men.
Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for membership.
Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.
Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?
On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!
(Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script?
Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign.
I don't know. That's like asking "Where's Waldo?"
Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?
No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.
I want this baby fully loaded. (listens) Well, how soon can you get it there? (listens) Oh, that's terrific. (listens) Okay, thanks, bye.
So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.
all right lets be reasonable, Bania. Im taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal.
Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.
All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a mnage  trois with her and her roommate.
uh, well I can't help you there (weakly).
Well, what do you think the big holdup is?
(to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!
I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door...
I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.
Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?
(Fast) Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me!
Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.
I know enough not to get on them.
Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.
(to Kramer) Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night. (frustrated) Where the hell is that jacket?
All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! Just wait here and I'll get it for you. ... Kramer this is Tia.
(Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.
You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.
Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!
We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!
Well. (calling down the hall) Call if you're gonna be late!
If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?
Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.
Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do?
Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.
(Fed up) Alright! Excuse me! (Gets up) I'm not buying any of this!
We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked.
No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it. (thinks out loud, opens phone book) Becker, ... Becker, ...
In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.
It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something.
Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing "no") A little taste! (still shaking) Come on. (still shaking)
Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying "mickey"!
We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.
I don't know. (takes off his sweater) This sweater really itches me. You want it?
Why don't you just get rid of it?
All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? (sits opposite George)
What are you all out of breath from?
(Pointing out) It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for "Avast ye matey" - what the hell does that mean?! "20 degrees off the starboard side - the Spanish Galleon!" - there's no comeback for that!
Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.
Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?
Yknow Im sorry you had to leave so early the other night.
I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back.
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.
(agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!
So I finally get to meet your pal Joey.
I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
(on the phone) Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.
No. This is why you're not in the pilot.
Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything. Why don't we all just go to Paris?
Come on up . (looks at his watch) ...What's he doing here now?
Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.
Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.
Toilet brush, oh (he pulls a 'Damn, shoulda guessed!' face). Alright, I can replace that.
Did you at least get him a card?
Well, look at this guy. Look, hes got everything, hes got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners.  This is not his first load.
But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.
Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that "Miss Congeniality" on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going? (Kramer enters.) Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey, what are you doing tonight?
No I can't she didn't leave her name or number.
Naw, I gotta wait until its just the right time.
Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket.
From my house. I got a whole box of them.
You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.
Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets.
Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!
(nudging George) Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.
I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?
No I can't I've got some stuff to do then I've got to meet Keith at my apartment at three. I'm helping him move.
Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.
(thinking) Whats going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, shes too good to be alone. Whats the difference, I cant maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me.
Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) "Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."
Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.
We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?
I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?
So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was just wondering if there were houses there to rent.
Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.
Yes. (To Jenny) You're sure there's nothing we can do?
So he just gets soup. He wants to save the meal. So now I got to do it all over again.
(on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV for another minute) The letter, that's the letter!
(firmly matter-of-fact) Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.
Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.
I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I cant stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion wont even exist. It wont. I think eventually well all be wearing the same thing. Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where theres people from the future or another planet, theyre all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided, This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and boots. Thats it. We should come up for an outfit for Earth. An Earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits. No speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, That was nice. I could wear that.
(looks in the creamer) Theres no milk in here, what...
Alright, but let me ask you this question.
Alright! (picks up the phone and dials) Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. You know, you got a great 'John Houseman' name. Alec Berg. Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg?
I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?
I dont know, I don't feel so good.
Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee.
All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm away, gets phone) now... the failsafe. The wake-up guy... (dials)
Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.
I'm sorry, Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen)
(as Kramer walks by) You're a master of race relations.
All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.
(leafing through his mail) Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.
Let me tell you something Babu. You go back in that kitchen -- tell your chef I want the works.
I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!
Well, your day's getting more interesting already. (Jerry shows the phone) Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.
Yeah. (subdued) I don't think this is the jacket.
(to himself) Hoh, that Milos. (to Patty) Well uh, what shall we do, uhm, care for a cup of coffee?
Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
(Reading from his notebook) I got You enter, you go "Hi", and I go, "Hello." Now.. we need something here..
Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred!
That was a one in a million Mohel.
No, don't stop, Kramer. Keep going, don't let him get away.
Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.
Sex, thats meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; thats heavy. Thats like an hour.
Listen, Matthew, I-I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do.
Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket?
To a guy you've never met? (mild sarcasm) Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous.
Cheque. Now, the fact is, if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, yknow, cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they dont know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster (Jerry draws imaginary book from a holster.) Who do I make it out to? Theres my ID. Theres something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I dont know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, I dont have any money, but if youll contact these people, Im sure theyll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I dont have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?
Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?
Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.
So you lie! What did you tell her?
These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin' to make that call! (George comes in)
Hi. Ah look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna.
Elaine, George (introducing them to Bania with less enthusiasm)
Look at you, youre still thinking about it. Ill never feel comfortable.
Oh. yeah. Alright. (pushes Kramer and Elaine out the door, then sits next to Sidra on the couch.) So, where were we?
I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!
(Trying to block out Kramer, he starts to sing along with the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus..
You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back.
And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone.
Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.
So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?
(sharp) I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.
We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?
I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man.
Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..
Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.
(going through couch cushions) Where the hell did I put this?
Let me see that. (Jerry looks at the tag.) That is high.
(referring to George's outfit) And what mood is this.
She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.
Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?
Yeahhh, am I imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and holds it up to Willie) Found this little cutie in the pocket. (throws the stub on the counter)
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.
Widower? Wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research)
That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this?
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.
A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the dish and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit.
Why dont you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps.) Whats wrong?
Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.
(Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My, isn't this an awkward moment?
So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.
You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...
Plus Im wearing short sleeves, I dont want to expose my tattoos. (Vanessa smiles; thinking) Shes unbelievable!
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!
Well, what kind of a kiss? Was it a peck? Was it a kiss? Was it a long make out thing?
What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?
(answering machine) Leave a message. I'll call you back. Thanks.
Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?
It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you.
Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!
(accusing) You're not wearing a shirt, are you?
There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.
Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.
Yep. Since college. (Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.) Hey, Lena Small's on this list.
Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?
How many years of med school did you have?
You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?
George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods)
Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!
Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.
Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...
(handing his dad a gift) Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.
Hold it. Broccoli? Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce.
Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.
The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?
She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. [sarcastically] I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... >click click< Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? >click click< I'm back...
But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship.
No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.
Keep following him Kramer. don't let me down.
Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?
Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!
Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than "coffee machine show."
Thats the bet! (The phone rings; Jerry answers it.) Hello?... No- oh, hi... (Kramer leaves) no, they just left... Oh, my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch em. (Jerry goes over to the window and opens it; calling out the window) Ma! Ma! Up here! Dont get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!!
Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.
(He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.
Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.
Well, how much are you going to invest?
Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?
Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?
Yeah, yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. Would you mind. I'd like to take the picture back.
Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?
Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.
(extemporising) Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was registered under Slappy White.
Hey listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, why don't you have dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if you want, you know, have a little company, take the pressure off.
Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.
It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.
Nah, I dont go for these non-refundable deals. I cant commit to a woman. Im not going to commit to an airline.
Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?
I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?
Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.
(Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really?
Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples clothes
So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh?
Get a march goin'! March it! (She exits)
You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't remember anything about you.
Oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh that's terrific... Mulva.
The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off?
So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?
(Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.
She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?
I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.
Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.
She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...
A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?
Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me.
Hey, look at the high score--"G.L.C." George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?
Soon as I get off the phone wih you.
What do you mean not going? why not?
I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?!
Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.
Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.
Just, uh, plop it on the counter there.
All right. As long as youre okay. Because I cant stop thinking about her.
Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (Jerry smiles. George laughs.) So, how's the book coming? (George's laughs taper off...) I say, how's the book comin'?
Ow. Stupid fold-out! Why'd they put the bar in the middle of the bed?
hey where were you last night? I looked for you, I didn't see you
Yeah! I got it . It's in the apartment, but we can't go in there it's being fumigated.
You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.
And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.
(Disgusted. To the woman) Oh, come on. You know he's a postman, don't ya?
He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.
Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.
Where do you suppose that could've come from?
Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.
It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.
Youre you. Were having lunch with Art Corvelay.
Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something.
(waving the key) You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!
I dont wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do you think?
No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?
No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. Maybe we should ask him.
I'll tell you, that There for you crap was a stroke of genius.
Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.
Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.
She went out to get her head shaved.
I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.
No, I tried it on. It fits good.
(acidly) Shes full. So, Big Daddy. Im just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?
Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.
(Losing it, mad) Look, it's not my shirt.
Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.
Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.
Alright, that's it.. (Grabs Kramer, trying to pull him out of the car)
Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. (The door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.)
That voice. That voice. Shes driving me crazy.
(noticing a coffee table book) Oh, you got the Civil War book. I saw some of that show, it was wonderful.
I didn,t tell you to park in that lot .. Now someone's gonna have to drive you every time you need your car.? Take the bus!
I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!
How would you know? You don't speak Korean.
Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again.
(To cashier) I'd like to speak with the manager, please.
No, I dont think so. Ive seen you two together. You make each other miserable. Its kismet.
Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!
I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us.
Anyway, you know why I didnt ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab.
Well, at least have some reaction to it.
Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.
What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.
I did not. You guys gonna go through some red lights?
Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?
But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.
Maybe I didnt want to talk to him.
What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?
So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.
Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.
You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?
Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere.
Hey come on, you're getting it all over the floor!
I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.
They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!
This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.
OK ... (nodding his head up and down) This is it cha know
I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.
Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.
Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.
Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet?
But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.
I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didnt want to talk to, I could go, Excuse me, Im not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away. I also have a cordless phone, but I dont like that as much, because you cant slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone  You cant talk to me like that! Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone  You cant talk to me like that!
You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.
Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
(Excited) I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!
Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.
Oh. (notices a car being jacked up by a tow truck) Hey, isn't this Kramer's car? (yelling up) Hey, Cosmo!! They're towing your car!!
Yeah, killed. Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark.
Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?
Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, thats a good idea.
You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.
Oh...yeah...uh you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.
We're gonna have to talk about this later. (Elaine holds the door open for Jerry while holding her leg) Thank you. Taxi!
I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
Whats to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.
Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.
What are you so worried about this for?
Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it.
(He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.
Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat!
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers...
Oh, really. (Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.)
Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there.
My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you dont make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life.
You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends....
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.
You know what? No champagne. Anyway. . . I'll see you later.
Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?
Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.
So the roommate laughed at everything I said.
(adamant) No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back.
She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass.
That's what a gym teacher once told me.
Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.
It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.
Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?
I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?
Lemme see if I understand this. In other words, you held out
Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail.
Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?
Its a good mirror. (They look at their menus.) So, what are you gettin?
Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.
(Reads the pill bottle) What kind of pills are these, anyways?! "For Smuckers"? "May cause panting and loss of fur"? (Turns to Kramer) These are dog pills!
Well I don't want to take too much off.
(to waitress) I' ll just have a cup of coffee.
I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.
Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.
Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.
Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger.
If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.
Yeah well King Edward didnt live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.
I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.
That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.
Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more.
Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's uh yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it?
Hang on just let me pick up a paper.
I *just* learned that. (proudly holding the Yo-Yo)
What's happening? What, you doing, come and talk to us.
(Trying to explain) Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past.
Its not promised to anybody? Cause shed take it in a second.
Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.
Hey is the same thing as hello. What do you think Jeannie.
I don't know. So what's this job of yours?
I don't have to be funny, I don't care.
She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence
Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?
Hey, hey. uh Pamelas birthday party, didnt I see you there? Jerry.
So you were talking, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") you're having pleasant conversation, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") then all of sudden...
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.
Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.
I'm laying down! Then we'll see how he does up there, without all the assistance.
Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up)
(hanging up the phone) Oh! There's my Chinese food, I gotta run. All you.
(to George) He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.
Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.
You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.
Yeah, uh, Ok, uh, tomorrow uh, where da ya - where do you live, uh, up town? Upper west side?
You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?
Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.
Although what if its one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?
Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.
This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.
Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.
Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income.
Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?
Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen "Girlie" Brown would be very proud of you.
He went back? What do you mean he went back?
Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this?
Of course, I stink, you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks..
That was brutal. I cant go back out there.
Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?
So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.
I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?
Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.
I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.
Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again)
Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the etiquette?
So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?
And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.
You know what the odds are on a crash it's a million to one.
Thats the bet! That youre not doing it!
No, but wait, wait And then you dump them off onto Kramer..
So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing?
Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much for so long.
I dont know. Theyve been in there since, like, World War II. The rents three hundred a month.
I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.
(reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.
I don't know , Who keeps track of Hellos.
No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.
No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.
I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?
What should I do, should I call the police?
The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)
Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thingreal bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though.
Is that guy still there? (They are side-on to Phil who is in the background, still pressed against the glass, aghast)
Why dont you ask that doctor what it is?
Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up.
(Fishing for his keys in a kitchen drawer) You know, when I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time.
All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you.
I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.
(interrupts) What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today. (on the phone) Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we would do that. Okay. Great! Thanks a million! Okay, bye.
Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.)
Well, Im sure you did. Who wouldnt love a pony? Who wouldnt love a person that had a pony?
Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!
Well, I didnt uh really mean a pony, per se...
Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?
Yeah, so Joey?s a great lover of the opera
well, you know, sometimes a square is everything
(getting looks from his parents) Not you. Older people.
Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me...
I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals.
This is the man you have a crush on?
I'll see you later. (he leaves with unseemly haste)
Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it They're roommates. She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back. She's not gonna do that.
You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.'
There he is. He's going into that bar.
I don't know what to tell you, Elton.
You got it ALL wrong. I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoans
Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank.
Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.
Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
Actually, we met in the gym locker room.
Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to 'em. Mind if I walk through real quick?
And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?
Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''. And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. "Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''.
Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them.
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?
And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.
George, who is that woman in the stripes?
Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?
You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!
No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
Either that, or theyve got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why dont you just go to the cashier?
Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?
I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.
(into phone) Hello Joe, listen this is Jerry Seinfeld, I really think there?s been a huge colossal misunderstanding,
No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?
Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.
Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me?
(to George) Hey, there's Pat. (calls) Hey, Pat.
George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, ok...do we know where the 101 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 170 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 134 is? (George just looks at Jerry) No. Aha, ok. (Jerry hangs up) He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up.
I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! **
Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.
Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. "Oo that little tail really turns me on."
Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of?
(to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?
But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.
(nonplused) You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?
Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, "Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. " "What are you watching?" "I don't care, I gotta keep going." "Who was that?" "I don't know what it was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going." Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, "Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel." You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, "Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of here. I'm going to bed."
I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.
I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, its very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, Call the police. You really should call the police. So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, Yeah, Im calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... Im gonna see some real action. Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out The Report. They give you Your Copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I dont really think were gonna crack this case, do you? Its not like Batman, where theres three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up, hes dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him, hes a PENGUIN!
Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.
Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.
Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you?
I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.
(in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room) Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad, you look so different.
Excuse me, uh...dentist? You a dentist? (The guy shakes his head. Jerry moves on to another guy.) Dentist? Are you a dentist?
I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I dont get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, Im not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, theyre so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, thats it! Its the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we dont know bout that, we dont know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas weve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! I dont think she likes me. The amazing thing is, that we still get women, dont we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. Thats why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like Where to meet men? Were here, we are everywhere. Were honking our horns to serve you better.
Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?
Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
All right, let me ask you this when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?
(TO KRAMER, REBOX) Will you let me help you with that?
You got toilet paper on your heel there.
So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. Whats the matter?
What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods.) Did he tell you whats gonna happen? (George shakes his head.) How long were you there?
Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me.
How much did you wound up tipping her?
It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?
No, I think the head does most of the stretching.
(pause) I thought you said... "ridicurous." (Donna looks puzzled)
Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room, searching for the TV.) ELAINE!
(Shrugs) Oops. (Continues walking along the route, whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street, then keeps walking)
She thinks youre a guy that doesnt like coffee.
George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!
(to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...
(Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.
When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!
(derisively at Kramer) Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?
But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.
(Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.
Over here. You can see right through here.
You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.
So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?
George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'
All right, all right. (trying on the suit jacket)
Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?
I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.
I know, and then you say to yourself, From this moment on, Im not gonna waste any more of it. But then you go, How? What can I do thats not wasting it?
I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.
I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright, I'm dropping you off at work, right?
So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.
Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.
(Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there.
Elaine is having a "houseguest." She's picking him up at the airport tonight.
I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and Ill just make up some excuse why I cant go to the game either.
I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?
(examining the button) Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like a tooth.
(apologetic) Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.
...I got you an apartment in this building.
Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.
Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made.
Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, that's it. They go to the next show.
Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?
Who was in town on a business venture, and um..
(interrupting) "Elaine , I really don't...............pay much attention to men`s faces."
How can you think of food at the time like this?
Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.
Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. >click click<
She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.
Elaine its her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back.
No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.
No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.
That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.
So, you would date a married guy? That's so hacky.
George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.
Yeah, Ill have the egg salad on whole wheat.
(yell) Move to the back of the drawers!
George used up all my guest passes already.
Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!
You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?
(to Mickey) Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?
I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.
Sure, Beth, these things happen. (Brief pause) So, have you told many.. people yet?
Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad it's Klompus.
So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?
I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... (Jerry stops, and mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica on the phone at work.)
Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh...
Where are you going, you just got here?
You never really had the right comeback, anyway.
(thinking to himself; picks up a tube) "Fungicide". Fungus?
Im worried I wont be able to talk to him. Hes such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.
Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you.
We didnt bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.
Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?
Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.
George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.
I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.
(hangs up the phone) Yeah, I really needed that suit.
So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.
And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?
Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.
His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I wouldve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. Hes so self-involved.
Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.
Great talkin' to you. (Nina leaves. To himself) What the hell is e-mail?
(To George) Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?
Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?
What are you doing? Were going out for dinner in ten minutes.
I never shouldve gotten involved in this. Im a nervous wreck. Im not cut out for investing.
(to George) Is that uh, other apartment still available?
Oh! I got a message. (presses button on answer machine)
Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.
I have no patience for lactose. And I wont stand for it. Um, Ill be right back.
It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.
So George and I went up to NBC and we told them the idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract.
(To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!
(While looking at posters of women wearing glasses) I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.
So have your parents found out about it?
I never should have made up those rules.
No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.
Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.
You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didnt take it. (pointing to himself) This is an idiot.
No, Uncomfortable? Not at all. (ASIDE TO ELAINE) My friend's wife's breast sticking out - why would that make me uncomfortable?
No, no I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like the title and insisted that he change it to "War and Peace"!
(to Ramon) Oh. Okay. (to Elaine) Wh, what is he doing here?
Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?
I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?
Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?
Ah, don't worry. I made reser... (catches himself)
I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home.
Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it.?
Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in big, big trouble.
(frustrated, to self) The whole system is breakin' down!
You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal.
Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.
What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasnt the one.
I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.
Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined.
Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting.
(C0NT'D) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.
Elaine got a new number because she died.
All right, all right. All right, thats enough! Lets get back to my deal. That undercoating, thats a rip-off, isnt it, David?
Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket.
(to George) Did you call me a wuss?
(uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.
Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city.
Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.
I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON UP (Jerry puts his head down - he's not looking forward to Kenny Bania)
Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.
So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo?
I don't know, but you look like you're happy.
No, no, no, another race - out of the question.
(on the phone) Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.
Um, I haven't got my watch on. It's being fixed.
Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. (Hands over Kramer's quilt.)
You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.
I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.
Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door.
He might want a show about anything and everything.
I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.
No, absolutely nothing. (They get up to leave) You're fantastic! (They meet up with Kramer and George on the way out) Hey guys!
(upset) Ohhhh, what are you doing? Kessler, its a tape! I taped the game, its one oclock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.
If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, Im telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. Im sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.
Well, thats it. You two are back together.
Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.)
Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.
(Takes the ticket back and looks at it, flips it over) The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too.
Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here.
hello. Oh, hi. What's happening?  what? oh um, sure,  um, yeah, okay, uh. I'll see you then. Yeah, yeah, Bye.
Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!
Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.
(Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.
They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!
George- What?! Youre kidding... Well, whats wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, Ill speak to you later. (He hangs up.) Wilkinson, the guy whos supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, hes in the hospital.
But you were supposed to get me a refund.
What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?
Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together.
On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?
George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!
Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.
Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.
(hits button) Come on up. (opens door a little)
Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.
Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
(interrupts) I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.
Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!
I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?
You like the couch? Ill tell you what Im gonna do.
No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.
No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?
Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets.
I just hope that whole pony incident didnt put a damper on the trip.
Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.
'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.'
Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.
Well, I have some money. What do you need? (pulls out some bills)
Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!
Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway.
Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.
So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building?
I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.
The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.
But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.
Well, I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble.
I don't know. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley..."
Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal.
(touching the back of his neck) It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.
A few stitches? I've never had stitches. I'll be deformed. I can't live with that. It goes against my whole personality. It's not me!
(to the phone) Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you- Oh, Hi. Joel... Oh, you just came in... Listen, I cant make it to the game tonight... I, uh, have to tutor my nephew... Yeah, hes got an exam tomorrow... Geometry... You know, trapezoids, rhombus... Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. Theyre at the Will-Call window... And Im really sorry... Have a good time... Well talk next week... Okay... Yeah, I dont... Fine.. Fine... Bye.
Because she's my wife! (The door buzzer sounds; Jerry answers it) Yeh?
(accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?
(putting the phone back to his ear) Yeah.
Well, good night [holds hand out and shakes hand]
It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it.
Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.
Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--
"...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!"
Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes.
Oh, see that's not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people.
You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.
I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. (Miss Rhode Island laughs.)
Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?
I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.
All right, Elaine but this is beyond news. This is like Pearl Harbor. Or the Kennedy assassination. It's like not even news. It's total shock.
Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?
Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.
Of course not, if I did would you have gone?
Wow! Zanadu . No wonder youre putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) May I?
Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.
What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?
You are the Queen of Confrontation. Youre my new hero. In fact, youve inspired me. Im gonna call George about something right now.
A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?
What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.
No, no. It-It's really funny. There's these two guys-
No, we don't care, we just want to go.
You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.
What is this? What are we doing? What in god's name are we doing?
1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass!
So it had nothing to do with you.
(to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?
I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha ha!
A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions) Ho, ho, ho.
Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes.
Didn't you see the sign on the door?
Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.
She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?
It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.
Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get in touch with you.
Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it.
I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.
No. We both just saw the same monkey.
(on phone) But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.
You had how many dates with him? Three?
I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'?
(Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.
Alright, alright. Uh, undo them. I'll help you get them off.
Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews.
(trying to defuse the situation) Look, no-one is lifting anything.
(sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand.
No, I do not like the bank. Ive heard the expression Laughing all the way to the bank. I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when theres nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, its empty and you still have to go through the little maze. (walking on the stage like he is going through a maze) Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? Im almost at the front. Id like a reward for this please.
If they were fanatic about showers, they might.
All I said was I liked the pen!
But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.
You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.
Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.
(Chuckles) You don't know the half of it.
Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.
Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!
Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.
I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?
(giving him a steak from the fridge) Here ya go.
Yeah, hes nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper up to Jerry.) I know, I know. Its down again.
It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!
The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.
Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)
Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.
Would you excuse me a minute? Im gonna go to the bathroom. Ill be right back.
Come on! I know it's something you wanna do! (she pulls harder and he falls right off the table)
I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship?
He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. He's a time slot hit.
He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them
(removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?
Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them.
Hello. Oh! Hi George.......What! ..really! All right I'll call Elaine , we'll meet you down there.
Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.
You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola!
Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler.
This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!
Well I started screaming, "There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina." Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running (In the background -- CLERKS VOICE 57) and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.
This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?
Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?
So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?
Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?
Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Yea nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?
I don't know. Who could've been in my apartment.
Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George.
Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.
(CONT'D) What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.
So, what are you up for? How about Mexican?
Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman anything you say she does!
And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my...
Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.
Technically, you're sauted. So, what are you doing for that?
I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.
I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.
Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain?
Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh...
Especially when you got a layover in Sarajevo. (Bosnia Herzegovina)
OUR LIVES!! . What kind of lives are these? We're like children. We're not men.
He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. (Mimics brushing his teeth) Away from the gums... (The door opens a little, George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and Elaine, then enters.)
Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't do you favors after you dump them.
Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?
I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?
Oh, alright ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....
You know, what you need is a song you can share.
Alright, come on, lets get out of here.
You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.
Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?
...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, "Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now." "This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration." You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration, (waves imaginary wallet) "Here's fifty-six people that know me." Cop goes. "Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check."
Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?
You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.
What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!
Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I?m serious, I?m not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.
(Unsure of what to say - he remember's Leo's courtesy tip) Hello?
Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.
So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else in real estate?
No, George was there, he said he had a great time.
What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying...
So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought ... What a coincidence. We're just about to eat.
A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!
I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton.
I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing.
George, we're trying to have a civilization here.
(checking his watch) I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
(Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together?
Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money..
No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.
All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---
So youre sure youre not still angry about last night?
Well you can't take her maybe you can't take me either.
The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. "Who was that clown?", "I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?", "The guy's a clown!". How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, "What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!"
I live in New York. (slams the cab door) What the hell happened?
Hello. Didn't I see you at the pro shop yesterday?
(Confirming) An alliance. (They both shake hands and laugh evily) Now get the hell outta here. (Newman leaves)
No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station.
If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.
Who's got a tissues? I need more tissues! Look at this thing. It's my phone finger!
Excuse me.( gets up and opens the door)
Hey, when Im driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. Im always waving everybody in. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. ...All right. All right. Ill have a chicken salad.
Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.
I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad?
Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--
Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.
There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.
All right, I'll see you after school. I,,m late for Hayman's hygiene.
Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.
I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?
Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers?
Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)
But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!
You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this? (moves his arm) He's gonna think you're a mental patient.
I don't understand. What don't you like about it?
So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out (as mortician) 'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'. (as Mrs Costanza, horrified) Aahh!
Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...
'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?
(Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal.
She's the model I met on the plane.
"So what about the Penthouse. Did you ask him?"
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.
(calmly getting up with plate of chicken) Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, (drops chicken into sink) was, for two.
He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.
Oh my god! Look what's goin' on here! She is depraved! (Grabs a towel and brings it to Lena.) There you are.
Well what about me! If you're going like that, I?m not going like this.
What if hes in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (Jerry knocks on imaginary glass.) How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? (He makes a hissing sound.) By the way, whats happening with Sendrax?
Yeah. (Kramer sits in the seat next to Jerry) Uh, uh, oh, oh, Over there. (points to the next seat over)
First of all, I made plans with Elaine.
If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.
Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met!
Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub.
And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus
If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld.
Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.
Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.
Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.
Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you.
It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.
And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises.
Im gonna make an appointment for you. Well go together.
Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.
I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy.
Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.
Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.
No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!
Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.
(After seeing how much his parents like her) Now, I'm not so sure.
So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?
You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.
Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that.
Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're puttin' it in my box now.
Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land.
I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.
I thought we were going to the movies?
I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.
You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it.
Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.
Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?
Ive got the softball game on Wednesday. Its the championship.
(is redialing) I should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.
Where have you been? You know, you're on next.
Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. (And to George) What do you mean you can't tell me?
Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.
Oh No, wait a second... Wait a second... I-I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name.
I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.
I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.
Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! Its a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!
Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.
No social reason for them to be here.
I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.
I think what he's trying to say is, "get the bouilla-base." (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)
(doubtful) I don't know, do you have a--
Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.
Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people.
They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor.
I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.
You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em.
What should I do? (to Alton) Uh, were taking a cab, arent we?
We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? (turns to George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George?
Well, just give it back, and I wont say anything.
Could you make a little more noise? (To his parents) Listen, I'm gonna have to call you later.
Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.
What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.
Yeah.. When he's dead he'll be relieved... Oh by the way Viking Press sent a Fedex for you to my parents. They brought it with 'em.
What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers.
Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?
Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish...
You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. Hmmm. What do you want?
Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame.
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.
You were saying Stan? I-I'm sorry about that.
What could possess anyone to throw a party? I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.
Shes waking down the street and it hit her in the head!
Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I, guess she passed out!
I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something.
And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.
I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.
Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?
He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal.
He left me there. You see the mind games?
Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.
Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...
Seth! Wow what has it been like five years?
We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.
okay , bye (to George) What happened , did you take it off?
(consternation) Oh no. (to the bedridden two) It's go time.
I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.
Im sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm gonna try to sell the van to a lot.
"I dunno how you could forget . He kept reffering to himself in the third person. "Jimmy's under the boards. Jimmy's in the open. Jimmy makes the shot."
And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.
I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life.
What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.
Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!
(Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?
Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.
Ah. But they told us we must go now.
So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.
I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.
(hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman.
Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.
(thinking) Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?
Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full.
Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for show.
You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?
Well its not like it's a really funny story or anything.
He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about "Jerry."
Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.
Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.
This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.
Sure, its like robbing a bank. You dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.
George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.
(sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there and I will.
Really? (They start to make out, Jerry sees the pilot on the plane) Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!
Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?
(reaching into his pocket) Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for it.
Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing.
Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there?
Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.
Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?
Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm.
So Whatley sayd to me, "Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic."
It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
I don't know what you should do with it.
You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me. He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back.. I'm putting this guy ....RIGHT OUT OF COMMISSION....
Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.
Great, you're lonely and miserable again. (presses button to call elevator)
Look, youre a nice guy, its just that... we dont have anything in common.
Babu? Babu...[waves Babu to come to table] Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just, it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?
The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.
[rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your point!
He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.
wait, where are you going? where are you going?
Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?
...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.
I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around..
Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.
Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.
I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. (Picks up the phone and dials.)
(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!
No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?
He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket books. Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.
(bored) Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it.
I once got Happy New Yeared in March.
Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them.
Is there, something I can help you with?
I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.
If you need more time, you should have more time.
This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.
My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didnt want to move to Florida, but theyre in their sixties, and thats the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old peoples house with a golf cart, jump out, Lets go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. Drop it! I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversations so boring. Its so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, What if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass. You know. Come back in, theres broken glass, everybodys all upset. No, Im all right. I was just a little bored there. And uh no, Im fine. I came back. I wanted to hear a little more about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Lets pick it up right there.
Yes. I do love her. (to baby) You have a very nice place here.
Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?
Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.
You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.
We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.
(answering) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Um, its for you.
No no no, dont interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what its doing. Just let it finish.
Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?
Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.
Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.
I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.
I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.
Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered? (Sees the pac) What happened?
What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. (acts like he did in the movie) Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. (does the next look) I mean, beyond that, Im risking a punch in the mouth. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?
Oh, no don't say that. You'll jinx me.
Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am  rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give...
Why would I freak out? (To himself) Pilot...
I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?
Thats different. I didnt have feelings for those people. But you, youll backslide
Hey, get out of here...hey officer, he's fooling around back here.
But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure.
(thoughtful) Hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey, there it is.
Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.
What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?
Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad.
How do you like that? (tries to turn away again; thinking)Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I cant, I cant. Im stuck.
I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.
Seth, it's me. What's more important than catching up with an old college buddy?
No no come on really, get another one. Itll take a second.
Yes you do. That's what you both think.
You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.
No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him.
Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!
Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.
(tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back) Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.
Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!
I've hardly been out to dinner with them.
Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.
Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . What could he do?
OK, fine. 'What do I have to do to put you in this van today?'
Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?
Yeah. What's wrong, why? ( George runs back to the bathroom)
So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk.
See, its never as bad as you imagine.
See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.
Doesnt think anyone can tell. So cmon, do we have a deal?
Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little longer)
I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.
All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.
Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?
So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots.
Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.
Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?
Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line.
A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?
Oh! Come on, you told them you're from out-of-town just so you could stay in a hotel room.
Relax, hes late. Hes always late. Its part of his M.O.
See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup...
Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend. (puts his arm around Elaine's shoulder, but she shrugs it off twice)
Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. (holds his nose up like a pig) You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.
Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)
Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.
why don't you just break it off with her. tell her it's over
It's been three days already, forget about Lupe.
Yeah. You know, kind of a peace offering. Cute.
20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.
Well, I just want you to know I'm there for you. Course now I'm here for you, but when i'm not here for you, i'm there for you.
I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? "You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know "No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back."
Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.
All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom cab.
Yeah..... He caught me So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend to look at the coat.
(in the hallway, hearing the door lock behind him, turns back) Kramer!
That puddle! (Kramer sees the puddle and does a double-take.)
Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, "That's not a bad idea."
Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit) And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.
Oh, like you know what you're talking about!
Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.
Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.
Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.
I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.
Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference who's tall. We're all tall.
Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!
There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.
Ah, just remember when you see him tomorrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him.
Y'know a lot of people have asked that...
Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!
I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all.
There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing *just* a bra. I can't get that image out of my mind.
You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!
Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em. (starts backing away as Kramer follows him around the room carrying the underwear)
Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person.
You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me.
I don't understand why we have to eat now.
You're meetin' the father for the first time?
All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a specimen.
Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.
Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.
What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?
Oh. like they wouldn't have found that anyway.
How are we gonna get out of it?
Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other line. Just a second.
Well maybe he's got like a, cheerful mental hold on you.
So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.
Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.
Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?
What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog.
Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!
I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president James Polk!" (ELAINE had echoed "Uh-huh. Yup." during it)
Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going "boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly."
Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.
Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.
Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?
So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?
What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police dont use them for, you know, crowd control. (Jerry crouches down, and makes like hes riding a pony.) Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, Im talking to you. Behind the barricades! So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldnt it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... Baltic, thats two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, thats it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.
Never. (The elevator door opens.) Wait a second. Thats her. On the right.
Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.
(As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George.
(into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!
Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days!
Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. (They go out into the hallway and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.) Hey, how ya doin.'
I can't believe your a friend of mine.
You're not going to open with that, are you?
Okay, fine. (Jerry takes a coin from his pocket.) This is the official flip. No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and thats it. Agreed?
All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?
(Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.
So why didn't you tell her the code?
What do you think the Nazis were doin? (Imitates the Nazis salute) That was the heil-five.
You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is! I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, someone asks me which way is Israel, I don't fly off the handle.
So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.
Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime.
Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.
This is a person I like, its not How to score on spring break.
You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.
What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?
I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.
Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.
Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)
(more disgusted) Ohhhh! You cant! Its impossible! Theres no break in the conversation where you can go, All right then... You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.
So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)
Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?
I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there.
Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited.
It's gotta have something to do with Kramer
No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.
I can't figure out what's going on here. I can't follow the plot. Why did they kill that guy? I thought he was with them?
So Kramer, what are you going to do?
I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it.
Hey, were kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?
"Jimmy's got a record. Jimmy's jumping for dollars. Jimmt and George are gonna get rich."
There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?
Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.
Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.
Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!
(thinking) Well, the drive home should be a delight. Im speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I dont care. (to Vanessa) That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room?
Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet.
Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits on a couch.) Hey, what about this one?
I got a date with that girl, Lena.
(Pointing) He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..
But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.
You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you... (catches himself)
She was looking for someone to go to the show with.
(calls) Hey you two. Im ready to go.
You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.
(finding Frankie, in his hole) Frankie... come on out of there.
Alright, I'll change my shoes. (Heads back to his apartment. George follows.)
Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.
If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!
(To George, in a 'cha-ching!' motion) Vermont! (To Ellen) With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to! (George is disturbed. He gets up, goes go Kramer's door, and knocks. They talk) Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I can't wait.. buy-bye. (Hangs up. George and Kramer come into Jerry's apartment, confronting him) What? (George takes the phone off the hook) What is this?
(looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it!
Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! (Kramer gestures sympathetically) And who buries a bird?
Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read.
It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.
All right. But then I can't tell you the BIG news.
Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.
All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff.
I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.
I would like to propose a toast....Wait a second.. George! George Costanza come in here.
I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? (Kramer holds a broken Tony)
(stares at George, incredulous) "Back on"? What was it doing off?
Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...
Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.
Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.
You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?
C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.
Well, theyre three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.
You know, I think he wears a piece.
(to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?
I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...)
They did it for three years. What's another few months.
Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day.
Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!
But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.
NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye.
Yes. Yes I am! (to Helen) What else did she say on the phone?
It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.
Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.
All right. That's it, I can't work like this.
A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?
Ma, I told you, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan... Okay, bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Rava) My mother. She forgot how to make French toast. You know how mothers are.
Um, actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet. (takes the paper back)
Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! (runs back to his seat) Bad lighting on the porch.
I love the day date. No wine, No shower.
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed...
I'm not paying for anything until I get that back.
Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers?
Okay.. (Opens the door to a frantic Elaine)
You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.
(bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.
Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.
Well, thats it. Look, Im going to Vermont. I dont want to think about this. Im selling.
I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.
(TO GEORGE) Hey George, you ever see one?
Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.
Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?
You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.
I said I couldnt believe you liked that commercial. So what?
Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.
This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.
I think I heard her say something about a bench.
A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.
Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?
Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.
Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.
Fine all done, just looking for the soap.
We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.
I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...
How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it.
(walking out) Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody.
C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!
I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.
No more crutches, that must be a relief.
(Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?
So get this we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.
(thinking) So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?
Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly.
She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.
But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
Yeah, I cant eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I cant dance.
(Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing is now?? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!
So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?
I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.
Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand.
Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men
Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.
There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing.
Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?
. . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?
Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know its missing, and he took it! And of all things to take! I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. Hes crazy.
(stopping them) We better not. (they make out some more; then stop) T-They're gonna be here any second.
It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!
Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it!
Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!
Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.
Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.
Maybe we should get you to a hospital.
All right, now you call it in the air.
Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.
And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
(pointing to napkins; to Elaine) Could I get napkin over there?
(explaining) I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.
He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.
Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.
No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.
Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy.
Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. "I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa " Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... (Naomi exits) it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality.
I know, I just can't bring myself to do it meanwhile that freezer keeps getting smaller and smaller (she smiles) (Elaine looks at her watch) oh, don't wanna keep Tony waiting
And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.
So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you.
Uh, hang on a second, You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck.
It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.
Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.
How do you get all that wood in here?
But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?
(Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to look, but Jerry stops her) I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs.
Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door behind him)
Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?
Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and put it in.
Hey look, there's a spot right in front.
Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.
Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.
Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.
How late are the stores open? Im thinking of maybe uh, buying a new TV and smash it over my head.
No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.
And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.
Hey, guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!
Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.
You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...
Alright, then just get rid of it. You wont have any problem.
Yeah , she's coming to see my act tonight.
You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?
Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?
Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?
(disbelief) So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?!
(to George) You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! It's crazy Joe Devola.
Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to rides alone.
(pointing at Georges shirt) See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. Its too high! Its in no-mans-land. You look like you live with your mother.
I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.
He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes.
Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender! (an event guard stops them)
A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?
You see the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around, but they don't know they're ugly, because nobody actually tells them.
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?
(starts pulling them apart) Alright break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells)
It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?
All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.
They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?
(getting worked up) I don't need the money.
I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
(to himself) Once a week? (to Uncle Leo) So how's Lydia?
No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?
Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.
All right. (goes into his hallway and comes back) You got my fins?
So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.
What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do whatever it is you do. You disgust me.
Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?
Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.
I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..
Well you should hear the message from my nut. Where's George and Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, I feel very vulnerable.
You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.
Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police! Some guy just gave me a wise answer. Ask that woman.
Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.
Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be.
Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!
Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.
Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not, a chicken.
50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.
Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.
Well ... ok, I guess (voice trailing off)
You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.
I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.
Kramer there's no way you stick to this.
We make all these plans - this idiot goes a hundred miles an hour - the whole weekend's over - incredible - just like that -
Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.
Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?
Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!
Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea.
hey you know it's weird because that voice sounded a little familiar to me
Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the lunch with me?
(Making nothing of it) So? Who cares about that?
So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more "grease monkey".
Wow. Kenny Rogers Roasters. Finally open. Hey, look at the size of that neon chicken on the roof.
See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.
Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.
You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.
George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.
Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.
I am not gonna taste your peach. I ate some one's pecan last night, I'm not gonna eat your peach.
Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! (Kramer enters.)
No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.
My whole night's ruined. I didn't do any sets, didn't do any movies...
Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.
And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?
(after the guy) You think you're better than me?
Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh
Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.
My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on. (Kramer enters with a bucket and starts filling it with water on the sink) Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.
Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats right behind the glass?
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.
Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, "Photographs - Do not bend".
No, its okay now, that, that girl is not comin. Uh, I misread the whole thing.
Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.
So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!
yeah, it's a damn shame, a damn shame!
You want to get something to eat first?
Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.
Theres nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.
That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.
Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.
Forget that. He's a ball player. MVP< 1979. I'm making wise cracks in some night club. This guy was in game six. They're a perfect match. They like go together. They're like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.
(surveying the restaurant) Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it!
No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.
Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.
...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the patient!
And she wants to break up with you..
A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see 'em. Come on, I'm calling! (thumps hand on table) What d'you got!
You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
(on the phone) Hello? No, Im sorry Bania ... Im not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye.
The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?
Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.
Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.
I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something.
Kramer! (We hear Kramer's door slam open and shut. Kramer enters. Jerry comes out of his room.) Hey! Where's all my sneakers?
Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.
But you gotta know how to work the projector.
He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in.
The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.
Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?
Dont worry. (whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!... Its Jerry!... Jerry!... From next door!... Never mind where I am!... Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!...
I mean, she called me. I havent called her. She started it.
Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.
I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?
What you must understand, Elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) Youve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.
Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal [and, ala Carson] Wild, Wild, Stuff...
(acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?
$40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.
What are you doing? Were going out to dinner in ten minutes.
So you want to just abolish all home package deliveries.
(Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.
Non-fat yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it.
Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!
Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys.
I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I - I don't even remember the name of the town.
What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. "I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other people. You won't be around me. But you will be around." "Take care now." Did you ever say that to somebody? "Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now." "Take care. Take care." What does this mean? "Take off!" Isn't that what you really want to say? "Take off now."
I know. Im really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.
Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?
But that is not what they would have you believe.
I gotta talk to her. What do you think?
We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie.
"I don't think so. I think they were getting dressed and not only that; my shirt was out!!!"
All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.
I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.
Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.
(Jokingly playing off Kramer's statement) With a different body.
I still don't know what the idea is.
You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy.
Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you (throws the bottle to Kramer.)
(answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.
What's even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics.
Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.
You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?
Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.
(thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And Ive still got another day! Ive got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. (to Vanessa) Thats a nice watch. Do you wind it?
Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no--
Oh, heh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.
I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to Jack)
(to George) That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.
Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.
Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?
So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day?
Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count on me! (hangs up)
(reluctant) Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy.
All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll meet you in front of the theatre.
Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.
Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I never know what to write on these things. I hate doin' this.
Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--
Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out.
How you gonna get out of *that* one?
All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?
All of a sudden it hit me, I realized what the problem is; I can't be with someone like me.. I hate myself!! If anything I need to get the exact opposite of me....It's too much. It's too Much I can't take it ...I can't take it!!!
I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night only, the big screen. My hands are tied!
More Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I don't even have any wood in the house!
That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.
Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..
You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.
Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
All right. (picks up the alarm clock) Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 650... volume check. (music playing, he starts swinging) What kinda music you wanna wake up to? Top 40, classical...
That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up. (phone rings) Excuse me one second.
Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.
Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.
This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.
Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.
Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!
You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.
Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)
Elaine, see this T-shirt, six years I've had this T-shirt. It's my best one, I call him Golden Boy.
Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises?
In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.
Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may depend on it.
So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.
oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this.
He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.
Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, (looking at the TV) Kramer, turn that up.
No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.
What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of temperament?
Id really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.
Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.
(stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored)
See I was saying "six" but she thought I was saying "sex". We straightened the whole thing out though.
Hum, well it all comes as news to me.
Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer!
Oooh! I got a pain in my side.
What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?
Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.
You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.
Yes, but lets just stop it right there.
Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.
Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.
Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?
You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.
Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.
They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys.
I could tell you what I did, but you wouldnt believe it. Its not believable.
You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.
You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.
That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.
He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.
Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
What? (to George) What did, what did you say?
Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.
I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
I cant believe this. So what are you saying? You didnt like my act, so thats it?
So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.
How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!
But your were an executive, this is fast food.
Oh my god, you're kidding. (dives for his wallet) Hang on a second. (reading from his registration) It's JVN 728.
Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya doing?
(quietly, yet in a high and whiney tone) Well, I don't know if I....
Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.
What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?
Hello, oh hi Duncan, 400 o'clock tomorrow? That is not going to work. . . . Why? I'll tell you why. Because I chose not to run!
Why, you don't think it's a good job?
We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)
Newman . Open the door, Newman, I know you're in there.
Yes, so people are just dialing it by mistake and getting you.
Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.
The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.
I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.
(to the phone) No believe me, Im always up at this hour. How are you?... Great... Sure... What time does the plane get in?... I got my friend George to take me...
(wiping his brow) He could use a couple laughs.
So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new guy, in a big pot of love stew.
Oh! Come om . He'll be over there for a half hour, he gets lost over there. C'mon so what is this about?
Get out of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The Heart Attack')
That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.
(Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.
So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box.
So you just pretended it didnt bother you?
(trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents.
I mean I'm happy sometimes, but-but not now.
Oh, Im sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.
Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.
How much money is this gonna cost me?
You cannot buy half a can of soda.
Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.)
So what are you going to do with the mattress?
Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!
(Joking around) I think it's the stench of death.
Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly) and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it.
So, ah, what are you doing around here Ramon?
Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.
An old friend of mine, whom you may have met, George Costanza, has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formally a highly placed official with an outfit known as the IRS. And as we speak, at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information. And she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise.
Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, Ill see ya.
Yeah, I think it is. (They walk toward the man. Jerry hesitates.) Wheres Elaine?
Because you were too busy stealing a book.
Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.
Let me have a look at this thing.
(doubtful) Yeah, you'll make it up to me.
I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.
(to Elaine, still joking) He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!
Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat...
No, gore-tex. It's new. (Checks his pockets.) Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that.
Well, I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.
Okay. (closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self) Didn't come true.
Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.
You want food, don't cha? (nodding his head up and down)
Donna, really, youre making too much of this.
She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.
Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.
Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?
Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.
Hello? Yeah he's here. (to Kramer) Hey! It's for you.
Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.
Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.
George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.
No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.
Oh, well, I didnt actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into him there. (putting on coat)
These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you?
The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!
I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.
Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?
Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. (Kramer picks up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.) Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! (Kramer starts filling a pot with water.) What are you doing with that?
No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.
Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?
I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.
Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?
Do you know what this is all about? Do you know, why were here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about We should go out? This is what theyre talking about...this whole thing, were all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, were all out! There are people tryin to find us, they dont know where we are. (on an imaginary phone) Did you ring?, I cant find him. Where did he go? He didnt tell me where he was going. He must have gone out. You wanna go out you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...Then youre standing around, whatta you do? You go We gotta be getting back. Once youre out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, its my feeling, youve gotta go.
Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years.
I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot.
Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?
So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.
(Scoffing) Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.
Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.
Well, either you see him or you don't.
It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.
(Stopping him) No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!
[not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]
Don't look at him. (Phil starts to knock on the door)
That is a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. Some guy from NBC saw my set, he wants me to do a showcase. I might have another shot at a pilot.
I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.
No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.
Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?
I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble. I'll do it myself.
No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble..
Why do I have to go on the tour?
I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!
(to George) All right, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend Im disappointed. Youre going to really see me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this. Maybe you should go in the other room.
You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...
You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?
(Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla.
Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss.
Alright Kramer, enough of this. Let's go find George.
Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.
They sell them by the side of the road. Blueberry, Blackberry ....
Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in your friend John Germaine's band there.
Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.
Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that. (stepping over Elaine then George's legs to get to the large blue chair and sits down.)
I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?
I don't know, but we don't have much time.
Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..
Well, would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.)
You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!
Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.
SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya! (the inter- com buzzes) Yeah?
So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.
Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched voice) Gone.
(tucking in his shirt) Oh ya this is Rachel.
Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls down, make it an eight room luxury suite.
Get in the car! Get in the car!
You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.
(reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.
Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isnt that child abuse?
Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.
Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!
I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, Well, its ruined. And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, Its not our fault. Were not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation. You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? Theyre cleaning our clothes, but theyre not getting anything wet. Its all dry. I know theres gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that theyre using. Theres no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (Jerry brushes off his shirt.) Thats dry cleaning. I dont think thats what theyre doing back there. They dont have eighty guys going, Come on, hurry up! Theres a lot of shirts today!
So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.
(Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.
Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)
No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.
Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didnt want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And its been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. (to Kramer) All right, so, just take what you want and lets get it out of here.
You're really going to town with that turkey there.
Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order.
Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town.
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!
(Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying.
Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up...
"I don't know but I was spitting out and rinsing like there was no tomorrow."
Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.
Gina, do you know what a Drakes Coffee Cake is?
It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!
I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. "Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life." Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, "I had a heart attack this big (Holds out hands, gesturing bigness) ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear! (Puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest) Brrhht.. and it's gone!"
You know 'm just curious, How did you know she wasn't my girlfriend?
Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.
(placatory) Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me.
We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.
Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out?
Uh-huh, yeah. (Smiling, nodding, clearly wanting Bryant to shut up)
He's got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, Jerry notices one of the movie goers) Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?
Yes. I do. You show me where there's a can opener in that drawer. (Answers the phone.) Hello! I'm sorry, I'm just fighting with my wife.
(seeing Fredo's tombstone) Oh, my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up! (hands the shovel to Kramer)
Yea, ya, so...anyway what was I talking about.
Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe well get together.
So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?
Oh! Rimsky -- great great book if I may say so sir. I almost read the whole thing.
Super bowl! Hey, an original G.I. Joe. (picks up both items) With a full frogman suit.
Oh I'm stressed! (makes like Kramer, outstretching his arm. Jerry heads for the freezer for some ice cream.)
But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.
Ramon, what are you doing here? You could get in trouble.
Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally!
...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana...
Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch?
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
Wait a second. .Just give me a second
Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what youre talking about, now, come on, come with me. (stands up) I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.
You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.
Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
(Arms out, complaining) I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!
Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.
Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting. I'd have to get new friends. I'd have to get orgy friends. ... Naw, I'm not ready for it.
Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun.
How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean, it's only this wide!
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?
Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.
Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?
Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.
And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?
It has nothing to do with her sister.
Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.
All right. How 'bout this one let's say you're abducted by aliens.
Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?
All right, forget it, its over, Im not moving.
There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.
The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be?
Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?
Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.
So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up The good, the bad, or the ugly.
I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodations. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats.
No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing. (Jerry picks up the phone and dials the number) I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?
She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?
Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.
Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch?
What about this? This is blood isn't it?!
Can't you at least die with a little dignity?
Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.
Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!
Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here. (pointing up and down at George)
(into the phone, with a disguised voice) So, what's going on?
It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go. (to old man that enters) It was GEORGE!
I'm not sure, but I think she was nice. (takes a sip of water)
Just put a coffee table book over it.
Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot.
That's a hell of an organization they're running up there. I can't understand why they haven't won a pennant in 15 years.
Listen, uh I just remembered... Im... uh, getting a facial.
Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?
All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.
He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.
(talking to Beth on the phone) Could you put him on, I'd love to say hello.
I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?
(Looking down at the shirt; mumbling) Oh, thank you.
Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you?
(to waiter) Ill have a cranberry juice with two limes.
Were you crying? I mean, its just a grape. Youll find it.
He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.
You're not qualified to work at the catalog.
Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?
No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!
I'm going to the hospital to see Fulton. I'm not even saying hello, I'm going right into material.
That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow. It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.
Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip.
Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!
(to the phone) Hello? (disappointed) Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) No. Uh, I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesnt know anything. Hes just my next-door neighbor. Uh, nothing much... Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. Im meeting somebody... Uh, Wednesday? Wednesdays okay... All right. Uh, Im a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning?... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone.
Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car!
By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want.
(to Kramer) ...( words missing)...laugh , everything's nice and at the end of the night I go for a little contact. I get the PULL BACK. This woman said the filthiest things I've ever heard in my life. I get the Pull Back.
No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him.
So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night...
"No ,Elaine and I we're just discussing whether I could admit a man is attractive."
And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month!
Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.
Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?
No, no......(long pause . they stare at the walls) Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?
Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
(To Elaine) Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get some coffee.
Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?
D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?
You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?
I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight.
(back in booth) He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life.
Really? Did you hear that? Somebody else was killed!
Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?
See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.
(thinking) Yeah, thats normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?
Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's.
Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet?
Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.
... if this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this woman to help me I would have killed this man. I would have strangled the life out of him with my bare hands
What're you doing? I thought you were changing.
I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!
But I don't know if this is gonna work.
You cant go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.
No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that...
The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.
Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it.
I don't care, why are you telling me this?
Im just gonna get my jacket, Ill meet you downstairs. Whats the matter, did you call?
He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man that's some tart cider!
Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people?
The captain of the toes. (phone rings) Hello.
How long are you suppose to leave it on for?
Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her!
Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it!
You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.
C'mon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine)
Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead.
And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's pretty sick.
No, you stay here in the car. I may need you.
(pointing toward the guy) See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.
Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.
Hey! Same initials . How do you like that?
Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh, Ketchup? Pretty name for a girl.
I have to go over to my grandmother's.
Krame? Sein. What are you doing? Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island. What are your thoughts about taking a ride? You sure? Okay, but don't leave me hanging here. Okay, great. Let me give you directions.
Can you relax, its a cup of coffee. Claire is a professional waitress.
I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.
You know, the water pressures terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower.
Why should I have anything for say for myself?
Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.
So she kicked him out of the apartment.
Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.
Yeah. (pointing at Elaine as he goes into the bedroom)
You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.
(Kramer shows Jerry and Elaine the paper) "Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research".." Government funds genetic research at area hospital" ... Yeah, so?
(His thoughts) I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver.
I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
Doesnt matter. Whats the young mans name? I would like to meet him.
So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?
Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.
Dirt? That's alright, (for Jenna's benefit) because there's nothing wrong with dirt.
Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage from her yet!
(a lightbulb goes on in his head) Riverside Drive.
Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.
So what? A lot of older men have that.
Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on?
(Giving Newman a sour look) I'm just hanging out in this hell-hole because of George.
(takes the card from Elaine) We had a little fight this afternoon. (reading from card) Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe.
She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?
She'll have a cup of coffee and a broiled chicken.
What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?
Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.
No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first.
You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!
Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.
I said yes, but I don't feel right about it. I mean I hardly know the guy. That's a big step oin a relationship. The biggest. That's like going all the way.
Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.
(disgusted) Ohh! You know, and sometimes shell go, (imitates Marlene) Hello, Jerry? And Ill go, Oh, hi Marlene. And then its Jerry...
All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...
Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.
I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.
Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.
It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.
Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, "Oh. Tube socks." What are you gonna do about it?
Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!
Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.
I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect.
Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.
Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?
Yeah, well I don't trust this guy. I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.
Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?!
Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?
Can I make it up to you? Ill give you fifty bucks for the jug.
You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.
Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... Im sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if...
Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!
I thought you said you were a good driver!
Hey, I had nothing to do with it.
Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- Zip, I'm gone. (makes a running motion with both arms and his right foot)
But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?
(still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?
You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?
Best friend- Ive never been to your apartment.
You're going to make a good father someday.
Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.
(to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.
Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.
You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.
Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business thing...
Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?
With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.
(to the phone) Oh, its you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldnt have had to do this. Now thats two long distance calls I made to you why cant you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again; to nobody) Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much.
Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.
If I told you, you woulda given it away.
Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that?
Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.
So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club.
Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened. (listens) Well, I think you should. Okay, bye.
Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's leftovers.
Of course she doesnt have five thousand dollars!
So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't?
I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.
So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything?
I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there.
What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again.
No!!! The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him, you break his spirit!
Look Kramer, i-i-if I'm gonna live over there, y-y-you gotta take some of this stuff out. I mean this thing is really freaking me out (holds up a ventriloquist dummy). I feel like its gonna come to life in the middle of the night and kill me.
Aw.. right, code of silence.. how's that going?....Ha!!...
No, its not you. Its your stomach, hes taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.
Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here!
(thinking) Thank you, Pamela! (turns to talk to Vanessa; to Vanessa) So, youre a lawyer...
(advancing on Gary) ...and he told me that that... (becomes indistinct)
Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.)
I mean, every time I see him, it's Tony this, Tony that. George is like a school girl around him
Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal right now. (covers Jean-Paul with a blanket)
Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em.
Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.
(grimaces and takes the shovel back) I'll dig.
Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)
Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.
(Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my domain. But I will tell you this I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!
Well there's always a place for you, on our team.
That's the way they do it in Vegas.
We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing.
Oh, were meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building.
(Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything?
That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.
A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.
Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, you were right. I'll do anything!
Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time.
Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.
Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?
This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
(unenthusiastic) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) Im just, Im really glad youre here.
I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.
So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.
I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.
I noticed she's big on the phrase "yada yada."
Really? How come you never pursued her before?
So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?
What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy?
