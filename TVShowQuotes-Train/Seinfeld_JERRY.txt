Well, where are you going?
Uh, no, he's taking the car.
It's been years!
You what? You passed? How could you do that?
No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything off me, first laughs now ladies.
(resigned) At least it's show business..
You're not late.
Well, thanks anyway.
All right, I gotta go.
(sharp) I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.
Please don't crouch.
Don't mention it to anybody.
Remember, don't whistle on the elevator.
Can't hear a thing.
"Jimmy's gonna put the moves on Elaine.."
Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.
(annoyed) All right. (after a pause) Hey, you know what's weird?
He looks like you and he's working from the inside?
I think you got it.
did you say flinty?
You like full lips.
Come in.
Oh, see the baby again with the baby..
I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine!
Hello.
Of course. How are you?
Are you sure?
Yeah! Too bad.
Something to drink?
This thing has never worked right. (holding the machine in his hand)
All right.
Fine, if I'm off yours.
So she kicked him out of the apartment.
Where am I going to look?
Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?
No, it's too trendy, no Isabella's.
What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. (acts like he did in the movie) Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. (does the next look) I mean, beyond that, Im risking a punch in the mouth. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?
Imagine, spelling Mom with two Os.
Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.
I hear things.
So, what's it about?
And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard-working Americans!
What about Susan?
Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.
Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?
What were you doing?
(Angered) Hello.. Newman.
(Pleading) Leo..
Lloyd?
Got 'em on the street, from a scal... (catches himself again)
What's he doing? What is his hurry?
I know, I know.
Horses? Theyre like big riding dogs.
Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.
That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.
My parents are moving back too!
Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model.
George, did you get that chair yet?
What's that?
'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.'
No, it's tarragon. Hey Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had about you having my apartment keys and everything.
His father..
Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet?
What's the matter?
Oh, stop it.
You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught.
I want this baby fully loaded. (listens) Well, how soon can you get it there? (listens) Oh, that's terrific. (listens) Okay, thanks, bye.
Hey.
Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.
Why'd she get fired?
Hey.
Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.
Yeah! I got it . It's in the apartment, but we can't go in there it's being fumigated.
What?
What are you talkin about? Its fine, I love having you here.
Leave a message, Ill call you back.
Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read. I was wondering if-
Were friends.
Oh, Martin!
It's true.
trust me.. nah it's good
Sit down! Sit down!
(on the phone) Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.
Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.
How up to date?
What?
I know, I just can't bring myself to do it meanwhile that freezer keeps getting smaller and smaller (she smiles) (Elaine looks at her watch) oh, don't wanna keep Tony waiting
Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?
We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.
So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo?
Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.
Whatever it is.
Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.
Yeah? Whered he go, to an arcade?
Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.
I never heard anybody curse in a toast.
Still no Puddy?
I couldnt tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that
(What's goin' on,) like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--
Yeah! me too
Too romantic.
You and me.
Hello, Newman!
And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month!
Here. I got your money.
Hey.
I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.
Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight. In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.
No, I mean, I don't think so.
Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh...
I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?
Parsippany, New Jersey.
Revenge date? That sound like you more than me.
Really?
Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.
Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?
It can't be worse than this.
Well, I can't sleep with that noise.
Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?
You know their timing couldn't be worse.
(indicating) This is Elaine Benes.
So, can you believe that message? Now I?ve got to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
Yes, it is.
It appears that way.
Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding?
So have your parents found out about it?
This is too much.
No, that's midtown.
Hi.
You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you... (catches himself)
(animated) They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!
You really used to have a think full head of hair.
Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.
I'm sorry too.
If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.
Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.
Is my toaster oven on there?
Oh, I turned my jacket inside out.
Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!
Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.
You would turn me in?
Really?
Hey.
So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City. I'm performing at Bally's.
(cynical) I'm sure it won't.
Uh huh.
So get this book on tape.
Youre gone all right.
Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.
New shirt?
Hey...
Good to have you back.
Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine.
I'm with you.
All this for a Chuckle.
I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've been so helpful.
He's from a.. Yakima, right?
(is redialing) I should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.
You're cold?
A circus?
Well, I'm gonna do something about this.
So, you two been, uh..
(throws out his hands) What does he listen to? The all Desperado station?
(unimpressed) I, really can't say.
Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah!
No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.
What are you talking about?
(Mumbling out) Thank you, Bryant.
Hello.
(screams).
What happened?
Oooh! I got a pain in my side.
What's wrong?
Good!
And you were integral.
Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart.
Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone to ghost read it.
How much was under there?
Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip.
[whispering] No, no news. You better get out of here.
She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.
No, "yada yada" is good. She's very succinct.
You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy.
I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.
You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown?
I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it.
Can you get vomit out of suede?
Oh, oh take it back. Let's get another one.
No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!
I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.
Ok buh bye. Have a good time.
Yeah. Pretend like it never happened.
Yes, Mr. Beviacqua
Colin?
Go ahead shake his hand. You're Jerry Seinfeld. You've been on the Tonight Show.
What happened, did you pass the stone?
No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.
Uncle Leo.
All right, I'll see you later.
It's hardly been used.
Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.
You're telling me.
I understand.
Right, right. Okay. (Writing) Elaine enters.
And who else is on the show?
From what?
Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch?
Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.
Give me that rye!
I'm in show business.
So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.
Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!
Oh
No chance.
Come on. Something's on your mind. Out with it.
Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.
Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah.
Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that. (stepping over Elaine then George's legs to get to the large blue chair and sits down.)
No, I don't know if I'm invited.
Please.
You said this to her after.
No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum...
I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high.
Nice meeting you.
What ever happened to Darren?
Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya doing?
What's wrong?
Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.
So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?
Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.
Who?
He couldn't handle the weight.
No.
Well, uh, I uh, I dont want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe its not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.
How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean, it's only this wide!
Yeah?
That's what I do with him [points at George]
(to the intercom) Elaine?
Let's not even analyze it.
Tell me what?
(matter-of-factly) Youre engaged.
Ok
Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.
All right. (opens door - Red light floods hallway - a buzzing sound emanates.)
So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh?
I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?!
No no no, dont interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what its doing. Just let it finish.
This is going to be a shame.
Uh, friend of a friend. And you?
It was nice meeting you
My grandmother's in the hospital.
Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.
A marine biologist.
I wouldn't think so.
Is there a box spring?
Which flavor?
Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.
What the hell is that?
(Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.
cool guy? what are you, in 8th grade?
These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin' to make that call! (George comes in)
Tryptophan.* (*footnote - see end of script)
(surprise) This is your son?
What if I don't want it?
Come on. How was your date?
Yeah.
Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.
The jewel thief?
Im in for five...
I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them are doing her dance as they go)
Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that?
Really?
George is dating a convict.
Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.
Well, no, I'm not one of those.
Dermatologist? Skin doesn't need a doctor!
Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way.
Like what?
Hm. You ate.
What the hell...? Why is the door open?
Ma! Ma! MAAA! (Hangs up the phone in disgust.) Oh, ahhhh (sighs quietly)
Tomorrow afternoon?
Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing...
Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.
Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars.
Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?
Hello.
"Well , where is it?."
No story?
So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?
Disgusting?
The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California!
Except that it's not Putty.
He might die.
you moved into a hotel?
No I didn't.
Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?
So?
Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.
Stinks!
Did you give her a reason?
All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.
A few stitches? I've never had stitches. I'll be deformed. I can't live with that. It goes against my whole personality. It's not me!
Why not?
Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?
Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.
Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.
Oh please.
I cant. I got to meet Clare.
New couch, baby!
It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.
But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.
I thought so.
Walked right over to her table.
Okay.
I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
oh you're crazy
I'm a good printer.
What happened?
Why can't I?
No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.
The one with the Poppie stain?!
That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police! Some guy just gave me a wise answer. Ask that woman.
I can't. I'm not an orgy guy.
No I haven't?
Is that a thick marble?
Oh my...
Oh, good.
It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
I'm glad we had this talk.
(returning to the table) Remember Babu Bhatt?
You know who that is? That's
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.
(re-entering) Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again, are you?
Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches)
I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.
No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman.
It's at the jeweler.
Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?
No, I'll be back.
Get in there. (he pushes George in the direction of the restaurant)
No, I haven't.
Well, nobody sees the... cover.
I got my health.
He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh)
Really! Socks!
Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.
No. No. I was kidding. It's terrible.
From that woman at NBC?
(chewing) Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?
So what happened with Tatiana?
(consenting) Alright.
So, maybe they had Chinese food?
Oh really?
No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first.
Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please.
They do have their own schools!
A healthy person.
These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86.
Whats so amazing? Youve seen him before.
It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library
Isn't there a deductible?
Hello?
Well why doesn't he just come in?
Actually it's being taken care of right now.
He's gone, George.
Yeah!
How was the rest of Death Blow?
I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...
Yeah, Queens.
Tropic of Cancer.
I said, "How come no one's killed her?" Probably shouldn't have said anything,
I don't know. It must be love.
Hi. Ah look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna.
You tried.
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why dont you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin anything?
Oh, Oh, the IQ thing...yeah.
Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah?
What is it your business?
No!!! The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him, you break his spirit!
Well goody for you.
What kind of look?
Is that right?
(defensive) I didn't ruin your business.
What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you.
Okay. Hi, Poppie.
Hello?
Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?
Well, I did the best I could.
What?
Boy.
Take care.
So you didnt ask?
I had a statue!
Oh my God! The break-out/pop-in!
So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?
I don't know.
I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodations. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats.
Oh my God, George!
Oh, hey Ramon.
(Sarcastic) Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.
(picks up phone) Hello? (listens) Oh, hi Mr. Pitt.
(to Kramer) ...( words missing)...laugh , everything's nice and at the end of the night I go for a little contact. I get the PULL BACK. This woman said the filthiest things I've ever heard in my life. I get the Pull Back.
Are you okay? Did he bite ya?
Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
Oh! I got a message. (presses button on answer machine)
We'll take a check please.
Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.
Stop being so concerned with looks.
Mmmm.
Who's it from?
So what are you gonna do?
No, of course not.
I dont think so.
I'm gonna find out tonight.
All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.
Good idea. (Jerry calls Barry's office)
All right, you're beyond stink.
Well, what's wrong with you?
If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.
Have you ever been through an audit?
I like it tucked.
That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up. (phone rings) Excuse me one second.
Well, I'm not telling you.
Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.
And you misinterpret this how?
Statute.
(into the phone, with a disguised voice) So, what's going on?
Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?
Could you stop the counting?
Oh, well.
Who?
I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg." But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, "Would you mind?!"
That's a massage.
No, she's not.
I don't think so. Why would I do that?
Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.
It means he's lying.
Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may depend on it.
Hello there you are.
Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?
Oh, boy.
I got your message, (sitting) so I came straight from Atlantic City.
He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?
(To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom buzzes) That's Elaine. (Kramer buzzes her in. Jerry talks into the phone) Kramer.. (To Kramer) George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.
Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?
Thank you, no.
(Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do?
Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck.
(angry) Oh, you idiots!
Whats the rent?
She's into it?
Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you do likewise.
Hey, there's the old man! (hug)
Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.
Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.
You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.
What was all that sniffing?
Because that's your thing!
Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin?
No, but I expect to hear anytime.
I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a riot.
You cant do that.
Hmm.
No.
Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. Youve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?
Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read.
Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.
Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'
No, No bomb.
"Glamour"?
Well... we should...
Okay.
What's that smell? What are you wearing?
Is that so?
Unbelievable!
At me?
What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?
Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?
No, I dont think so. Ive seen you two together. You make each other miserable. Its kismet.
What d'you call it?
I don't know, regular human time?
He is?
Tell her. I wanna hear her reaction.
A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.
Hey, where's Kramer?
Amy and Jeffrey?
You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?
I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.
Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.
No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1,900 dollars.
Oh, thats okay.
I don't need a personal trainer. (Kramer comes in) all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.
Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" or, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" You emphasize "Jerry" or "bring."
See, now that I don't care for.
Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!
We're having the intervention for Richie.
Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to rides alone.
(to intercom) Yeah?
So he's Bizarro Jerry!
All right, the whole elevator business, let me just explain-
Oh.
I told you we shouldn't do it.
I know. Im really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.
So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.
Here. Two tickets. Have a good time.
Are you sure?
Yeah, big missing goin' on (spreads arms wide)
Flying Sandos. Beautiful.
Ah.
George, what's the matter with you?
Uh.. one of the three tenors.
Yeah?
Hi. Hi Winona. Nice to see you again.
How ya doin'?
Well, keep looking.
What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.
That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is.
Hello.
(Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.
Am I finally getting a baby brother?
Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again.
Oh.
Oh, well, that's at the cleaners.
Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?
(under breath) Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..
You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.
I don't know, but you don't have it.
All right, that's enough of that. (Jerry takes the plates and hands them to a waitress.)
Hey, wait a second. You know, we could share a cab. They're playing at the same Cineplex.
Russia, it's so bleak.
hello.. Erika
(consternation) Oh no. (to the bedridden two) It's go time.
So why don't you leave it at Newman's?
I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.
Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.
Okay... but theres no cake or anything, if thats what youre looking for.
Why?
(smiling with pleasure) You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile.
(trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.
(shouting) Man that thing is noisy!
I mean all that stuff is so small.. ((ELAINE is wryly assessing him)) stupid..
Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?
(leaving the room) I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much.
I'm sorry, really.
Well we're sitting here together. Why wouldn't you think that.
Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.
You can't play Kramer.
You're breaking up?
Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'
I'll take the first class.
You wanna go with me up to (clap) the Bronx and see if there's any flyers on George's car.
How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?
I know, I feel bad about that...
(To Kramer) Thank you.
To the Paul Simon concert in the park!
(to Helen) What about him?
George was right. Didn't take you long.
Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.
No, no.
Oh, it was nothing.
I am not an anti-dentite!
(Also guessing) Crook eye?
Yes.
Hot out.
You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.
No, really, I just got off the phone with him.
Do you want it?
Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in your friend John Germaine's band there.
(noticing a coffee table book) Oh, you got the Civil War book. I saw some of that show, it was wonderful.
Oh boy.
I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.
And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.
Youre a cashier!
That's the way it works.
And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus
Why not?
That's enough.
(surprised) He said that?
What if you destroy him?
Yeah.
(to George) So did you bring the lease? (George takes the lease from his inside pocket and hands it to Jerry.) All right, gee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time.
Oh, I'd love to, are you sure?
Uh-huh.
Yeah, under the counter. What happened?
Why?
Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see her tonight.
Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it!
Does what?
Boy, those capes are really coming back.
All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.
Check the pile.
She saved your life?
What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with. [To attendant] What is going on?
All right! Lunch!
And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.
I cant believe youre here.
What?
Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.
What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?
Don't you ever talk about her like that!
I don't know
Oh, come on!
you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?
They got away.
I dunno, watch it on TV I guess. Why?
What is this?
Is this a problem?
I wouldn't know where to start.
Yeah. What's wrong, why? ( George runs back to the bathroom)
What did you say to her?
Yeah.
and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!
(Trying to read the note) What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit.
Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning...
What song?
Yes, they do!
A letter.
(more disgusted) Ohhhh! You cant! Its impossible! Theres no break in the conversation where you can go, All right then... You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.
It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!
There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.
Oh. Hello, Tetanus.
So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.
(Shrugs) Oops. (Continues walking along the route, whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street, then keeps walking)
I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.
I told you, forget it.
What?
(hearing the noises) What's happening!
Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.
Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?
Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.
If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.
I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?
Yello.
Thanks , thanks
(Showing difference) It's apples and oranges..
I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks.
Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one.
All right, so I had wooden teeth, so what?
(unenthusiastic) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) Im just, Im really glad youre here.
So?
Oh, I guess it's broken!
What?
I accept.
Heeyyy!...
Yeah, so how's my money?
So you have no car?
Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?
Now, all we gotta do is write it.
No!
Uh, yeah. (broaching a subject) Hey uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to a meeting.
She died? Mrs. Hudwalker died?
Can you believe her?
Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?
I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up?
It doesn't matter. I want a divorce.
What did I just pay for?
It sure is.
Remember David Puddy?
I mean that's fine if that's who you are...
(Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off George, and puts it back on his bed)
He was running from a bee. (Elaine laughs)
(to Kramer) It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Wheres she gonna get five thousand? She doesnt have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. Shes gone. Then you come in, Why dont you loan her five thousand? What do you care? Youve got five thousand. Give her five thousand!
(Trying to change the subject away from Nina) Hey - Hey Kramer, what are you doing? You want to borrow something? You want to eat something? Come on in!
No, did you?
To the Laundromat.
Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.
Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
Right.
In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.
Sniffing, with his nose.
She dumped you?
Ehh, I dunno..
Yeah!
Yeah.
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.
(to himself) Hoh, that Milos. (to Patty) Well uh, what shall we do, uhm, care for a cup of coffee?
Could be it.
So I guess , you're not getting married?
No, I didnt!
Just talking? Well what's the show about?
Yeah, sure we will.
There's weather.
"No... I find them repugnant and unappealing."
It's just like in the movies.
Kramer!
Now you're talkin' crazy!
Of course I can, am I being funny now?
Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! (runs back to his seat) Bad lighting on the porch.
Kramer, she was murdered!
I don't know, opera, it?s not my kind of thing.
Adjacent to refuse, is refuse.
I told you!
all right. One second.
Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?
What stock?
There you are. Did you find him?
Its very good cantaloupe. (Kramer leaves; to George) So thats it? Youre out?
Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary.
Perpetuation of the species.
Did you shower today?
Nope. You?
I gotta get to the airport.
Who is it?
Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...
Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.
He puts 'em on a dental chair.
I don't understand. What don't you like about it?
Because she's my wife! (The door buzzer sounds; Jerry answers it) Yeh?
Yeah? Would you do it?
(Banging the phone against the booth) Elaine!
George is already in there.
Oh! Rimsky -- great great book if I may say so sir. I almost read the whole thing.
Ill have an egg white omelet.
(overhearing the other two Elaine, Elaine--
You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?
Acting.
You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?
Yes.
You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.
Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.
All right...
Hey! Greg
You live on this floor?
If he's black.
Thank you.
Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.
Ah come on.
Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.
I know exactly whats gonna happen tonight. Im gonna try and act like Im not impressed, hes gonna see right through it.
They did.
(Gesturing to Ellen) Kramer, George, this is Ellen.
there are no copies.
Indeed.
That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's.
Especially when you got a layover in Sarajevo. (Bosnia Herzegovina)
Well, I guess I gotta go, too.
Actually, we met in the gym locker room.
It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
Talk to Beth?
What records?
Im a nice guy.
God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?
I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)
I've hardly been out to dinner with them.
I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment for two days. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my parents. they'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own I'm sure it's gonna be some awful dump. Wait a second.. Have you checked in The Plaza yet?
Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.) You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?
Let me call him back... Hello? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.
(eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.
tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.
What're you, "Joe Hollywood"?
Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set.
Hold it, hold it...Look your gonna need the jaws of life to get out of those things.
Look at him.
Bless you.
It has nothing to do with whose house it is.
Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
Well, I'm sure you're not... Totally Depleted.
Marlene.
why don't you just break it off with her. tell her it's over
Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
What happened?
I guess they leave that up to the general population.
Oh sure like Monet.
Is that right?
Well, I still think it's wrong.
I got a date with Nikki.
It's not necessary.
How's it doing?
Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers?
Then how'd you get up there?
All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.
You can't make it?
Really?
How'd you find out?
Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.
So you called.
(to the intercom) Elaine?
Hey-yah, ho-ah, hey-yah, ho-ah.
I'm saying "get the hell outta there"! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call, Jean-Paul! A wake-up call!
Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, "That's not a bad idea."
Hello? Is this 555-8383?
Oh a slinky.
What a surprise.
I think he's gonna need, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
Toilet paper's changed.
Oh, hey. You got in.
Alright, then just get rid of it. You wont have any problem.
I Love you.
Would you care to join us?
Yeah?
Good morning.
Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.
Leave it. What about your back?
Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?
Mohair, I think.
Yes, so people are just dialing it by mistake and getting you.
I don't know, George.
We're behind you, Aquaboy. Godspeed!
You mean like...Liza!
In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.
(uncomfortably) Yeah that's too bad.
Oh, I'm the doofus?
Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.
Disorder?
So?
Hey, how's life on the road?
(pointing at TV) Hey, that's her!
(still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?
Yeah.
Oh uh, Kramer, this is Donna.
No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe it. I lost him. That stupid idiot. Now what are we going to do?
Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
No, Ill go. Im going.
Im a guy  it always looks like that.
Uh, Huh, yeah.
Kramer, you're fighting children?!
I mean, if were gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.
Yes, Lupe. I'm blaming Lupe.
Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....
Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
It's against the law.
I am not gonna taste your peach. I ate some one's pecan last night, I'm not gonna eat your peach.
In the freezer.
Laura.
I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright, I'm dropping you off at work, right?
I dont think you did anything wrong.
There are ways.
Aye......
Yeah, so?
I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight.
(continuing unphased) You wanna get the other end, cause I wanna get it in the hall.
Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.
Yes, bye.
But wait a minute...
Let me tell you something Babu. You go back in that kitchen -- tell your chef I want the works.
Don't be alarmed.
Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.
Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.
It's kinda private.
I wish I could, but, we're friends..
(to Rava) So, wheres this boyfriend of yours? I cant wait much longer. Ive got a flight.
Kramer?!
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
Oh, look! There's Gregory Peck's bicycle!
I'm asking Elaine to marry me.
Oven mitts?
Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?
Ive got the softball game on Wednesday. Its the championship.
George, here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
Levels?
I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?
I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
Yeah.
What could you have done?
Yeah and...?
You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?
I need a can of balls.
Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.
All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll meet you in front of the theatre.
Not a very long trip. (Enter Kramer)
I saw one once that could do sign language.
Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?
"No ,Elaine and I we're just discussing whether I could admit a man is attractive."
Alright, Kramer!
The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off?
Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?
Wait, he stopped, he's parking.
What you must understand, Elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) Youve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.
But, when did I do that?
I dont even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, Ive met them three times in my life.
I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody up.
Where's his teeth! Where's his teeth!
Being really clean and happy?
Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?
Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. It'll crush him.
It's a little short.
It.
Uh-huh.
You what?
Oh right, the new job, how is it?
Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred!
Oh, that's gotta hurt.
Those damn 'I love you' returns.
Oh yes, quite.
I should have some reason.
Ah, how about 830?
*I* don't like you!
Neither do I. (to intercom) Yeah?
What?
Yes, that is a definite possibility.
Yeah, but how could you be so sure?
(touching the back of his neck) It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.
Wow good plan.
What's he here for?
You like the couch? Ill tell you what Im gonna do.
(thumbing through his mail) Uh oh.
I mean, ... if you want to.
Yeah, he's dating a crayon.
What are you talking about?
You know what room Testikov's in?
What am I gonna say?
Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'
If not now, when?
So know every time you get dressed. You are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer.
What move?
It's funny.
One message. Hope it's not from you.
What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead.
(beginning to cough and struggle) Getting weak... Losing power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing without me. Nothing!
Yeah, he was nice.
Can't you shut the shades?
I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. (Picks up the phone and dials.)
Why can't I be normal?
I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright*, I forgive you...
I didn't know you had a hopper.
Look at this
Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.
Who would pay that much?
Maybe you should date the mothers.
Tough one. You're call.
Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.
You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.
All right, fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone)
I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.
But the whole car smells.
(Pointing ahead) Look out!
Hi Willie.
Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out...
We just met.
Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm.
You'll be out before we get the check.
Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.
So just start it.
He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.
Really?
huh huh
Course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.
Ah, you're screwed.
No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter (pauses) Oh no!
Toilet paper?
All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you double what you paid for it.
What're you doing? I thought you were changing.
"I dunno. He's so strange.'
Oh, that adopt-a-highway thing.
Bye.
He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.
(Exasperated) Oh, God
Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight!
I'm sorry, uh,
But I need the home bed advantage.
What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.
Yeah!
So is this a breakup/quitting?
Just . . . do it.
No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.
No! No pick!
Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from ourselves. That's what you said.
Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.
No, I can't do details.
Oh. thank you.
(on phone) But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.
He was gonna fire you?
Oh no you're not!
No question about it.
I dunno...
Oh, that's lovely.
Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know its missing, and he took it! And of all things to take! I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. Hes crazy.
I can't believe I'm losing Pam!
Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!
Yeah, I know. There's no call for that kind of attitude.
Date with Karen?
No. The police have no leads (sitting on the couch arm) and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.
Can I take a sweater?
I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?
I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
(deadpan) No.
Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
Oh! I think we're at the bottom.
Oh, like you know what you're talking about!
(picking up the phone and dialing) It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.
You're really going to town with that turkey there.
Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?
I know it.
Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.
Im just gonna get my jacket, Ill meet you downstairs. Whats the matter, did you call?
No. nothing.
No. Come on up.
C'mon up.
(Getting up) Alright, big work day.
Oh! Come on, you told them you're from out-of-town just so you could stay in a hotel room.
And . .
No?
What look?
Yeah.
Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.
Yes, all right, Katie.
All right.
I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!
(pointedly) Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars.
Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?
But I don't know if this is gonna work.
What, What is this? What is she doing here?
Hi Julie.
Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! (Kramer gestures sympathetically) And who buries a bird?
What's with you?
I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.
Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if its done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels!
Never.
Yeah, that's why I said hi.
Yes, but--
Shake is bad, but what if its the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?
I'm I'm a comedian.
Hello. Didn't I see you at the pro shop yesterday?
What?
Anyway, you know why I didnt ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab.
She wants to be back on yours.
Uh...I got married.
I woulda taken you to the airport.
Never mind
Yes, change. By all means, change.
You're walkin' like Frankenstein!
Lloyd?
(Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.
Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.
Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And Ill need that in the form of a question.
Why'd you tell her?!
You?
Do you wanna flip a coin?
I only have a twenty.
I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going "I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?
The religious guy?
Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen?
Alright.
What's up?
Sorry. Hang on.
It was a gift.
Yeah!
What do you mean?
Look...look at this can of tuna!
Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!
So you were talking, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") you're having pleasant conversation, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") then all of sudden...
If he does.
You know, furniture.
Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?
Wait a second, whats going on here?
Hey.
This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!
Alright Elaine.
No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.
Oh, they're all the same. Here. [gives him Dust Buster] Now if you'll excuse us, ..
It should resolve of its own volition.
(Rejecting) Ohh, no. No, no, no..
Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..
You just said 'Yo-yo Ma'.
Well...
Yeah...my wife.
Reer.
What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?
Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --
What seems to be the problem, officer?
Look at you, youre still thinking about it. Ill never feel comfortable.
You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West? Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.
Oh, what's the point?
So, did these thieves want any money?
(Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.
I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example.
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.
(humouring him) That's very nice.
240 bucks?
All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.
Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.)
A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!
The waiter was trembling!
Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.
Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...
Yknow, my parents are coming in for this...
Ooh! Very convenient.
Kramer you're going to have to face her some time
I think he's black.
(Pleading) I'm really sorry.
Yeah.
So what are you doing now?
I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards.
Why not?
See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.
Okay.
(raising hand) Faked 'em all.
No I can't, maybe you're faking.
Yes?
Just go.
But you could?
What? She said that?
You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.
There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a "Smell Gestapo". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush...
Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.
(hits button) Come on up. (opens door a little)
Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy.
I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.
...But with punching and kicking.
Why would anybody want a friend.
I don't know  six three.
Oh, you were pretty loaded.
Faster than a speeding bullet Lois.
(to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?
I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.
Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?
No she didn't.
I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something!
A bubble?
I don't know what's happening to me.
Come on up . (looks at his watch) ...What's he doing here now?
What?
(Nodding) Yeah, the other guy.
How soft?
She's coming up.
Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. "I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa " Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... (Naomi exits) it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality.
No. None.
The...black, leather...thing with a strap.
Yeah. Was that a beauty or what?
No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
Yeah. What does that mean?
Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh, Ketchup? Pretty name for a girl.
Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.
Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!
I paid what it costs.
It was funny!
What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods.) Did he tell you whats gonna happen? (George shakes his head.) How long were you there?
I don't know. Who could've been in my apartment.
(ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.
Ah. I know the chef there.
Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.
Yep..
This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.
Ahhh got my laundry back.
wait, where are you going? where are you going?
All right.
No no.
I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!
You're going to see Genderson?
Are you through?
Yes!
You know, she won an academy award?
This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
Right.
You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now.
I don't have to be funny, I don't care.
Yeah, and?
You faked with me?
Pez?
(to the Barneys sales associate) Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?
Yes, clothes. This is normal.
Really? How late are they open?
Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.
You're gonna have gorgeous kids.
I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?
Ah...the volume.
No, it's a nine-hundred S. (happy) It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo!
Come on, let's go Jean-Paul!
Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?
Hey.
Oh, how come?
Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?
Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.
Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, nothing. (still giggling)
Well, its a first visit.
Yeah. You know, kind of a peace offering. Cute.
We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.
Be right back. (follows Kramer out)
Hey, Georgie!
Well, for one think, don't listen to him.
It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?
Uh-huh.
Mr. Vandelay, of course.
No, they're old cards from my grandmother.
He knows?
How much are they payin' you?
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal, (steer).
So she was just lying there.
Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Yknow Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, shes probably screamin at those aliens, I gotta have a lo mein!
Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about it!
Kramer. (knock, knock, knock) Kramer.
Would you stop?
Well, at least taste it.
... as long as one of them is not him.
Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!
Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Caf Latte?
Hey
We do what we can.
Why no T-bone?
I cant. Shell get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.
Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.
Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!
They did it for three years. What's another few months.
Bye. (Hangs up)
Which one do you think I want?
They just took Susan to the Hospital
Oh. (unh - very quiet sigh)
I told you when I met her.
And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry)
Well, your day's getting more interesting already. (Jerry shows the phone) Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.
We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy.
We'll still make the movie.
I'm working in Atlantic City.
What's going on?
Hey you guys!
Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved.
Hey, how was the meeting?
NO.
Sure!
It's a monkey, Kramer!
Yeah.
I don't get this. How did this happen. I don't have a dog.
Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.
What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again.
Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?
Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.
Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later.
How come?
Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal [and, ala Carson] Wild, Wild, Stuff...
Ooo, could be from that blonde
I, I had no idea.
The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what youre doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? We have soda, we have soda, we have soda, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. Its a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and youre watching TV and youre drinking the exact same product that theyre advertising right there on TV, and its like, you know, theyre spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and Im standing there, Maybe Im putting too much ice in mine.
(reluctant) Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy.
You don't even know what a write off is.
uh uh, we're uh ..
Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction.
Oh God he saw me.
You've really gone mental.
Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?
You got the tickets?
Holly Go-Lightly.
You got the job?
What is this?
No T-bone?
Well, uh..
Yes, yes, he is.
What?!
Confucius, huh?
Jerry.
No. No, I can't!
It tastes like dirt.
Well, what is with you?
Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.
No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.
It's not totally impossible.
Donna, really, youre making too much of this.
I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I cant stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion wont even exist. It wont. I think eventually well all be wearing the same thing. Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where theres people from the future or another planet, theyre all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided, This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and boots. Thats it. We should come up for an outfit for Earth. An Earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits. No speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, That was nice. I could wear that.
As soon as is humanly possible.
Hang on.
You'll never say that to her face.
People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.
Let us pray.
You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.
You're Filk.
I don't know. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley..."
You're a lunatic.
Oh, he sang like a canary.
Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and put it in.
Yeah, me neither.
So tonight are you going to make the move?
So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.
You're lucky they let you drive a car.
That close, huh?
What car?
Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!
No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.
You got something in your teeth there.
(Trying to explain) Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past.
(pointing) There's George!
Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me.
Had I been taking...?
Yes.
Yknow I think that even if youve had a relationship with someone, or lets say, especially if youve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, its very difficult. Isnt this? Its hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. Its like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, Look, a rabbit. The other goes, So? I believe this is your card. Look, why dont we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?
Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... Im sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if...
Really? Wow.
Not if you have a doctor's note.
Really? What would you do?
She died.
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!
That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow. It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.
I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation. The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?"
Nothing, what's doing with you?
Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.
No.
Yeah!!!
I'll say.
I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)
I don't know, some mints or TicTacs.
Nothing...
Would you give him the TV back?
Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will.
No, its not that.
Alright, I'll change my shoes. (Heads back to his apartment. George follows.)
Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.
Grandpa clothes, I cant wear em.
No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.
Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.
Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye.
No one's going to do that.
Let me walk you to a cab.
I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!
Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please leave.
What clothes?
Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that?
Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?
(lying) Yes.
You got it ALL wrong. I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoans
That's so funny!
Two Forty-Five.
Yeah, sure.
That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great! (he starts to install the table)
She is?
(surprised) Alright.
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?
I don't know. They're, backed up.
Someone says, Get out of my life, and that doesnt affect your appetite?
Right. Go right!/South!
We're with him, we're with him.
Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.
Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.
What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.
Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you.
Come on up.
Hey.
I don't want it.
He's a comedian.
Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.
Yeah!
Oh why don't you go sleep over at Newman's.
No more mentor?
No, I told you I admire your hearing.
The Truth.
Where is this coming from? She's great!
Oh, Okay (turns to rest of table) Im sorry, I didnt know what to bring, nobody told me.
Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?
(shocked) What the hell was that?
Oh, she didn't mind?
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?
What look? Nothing.
(pause) It's your third day..
It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me.
Yeah, it's very good. (reluctantly)
[indignantly] What's the matter with you?
Yeah.. When he's dead he'll be relieved... Oh by the way Viking Press sent a Fedex for you to my parents. They brought it with 'em.
So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out (as mortician) 'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'. (as Mrs Costanza, horrified) Aahh!
Write it off what?
Hey Mick.
And what's with people getting sick?
You've caught your mother opening envelopes!
No, see, we didnt have ponies. Im sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..
I thought we were going to the movies?
Hey, where have you been?
Of course not, if I did would you have gone?
Who are you?
Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.
I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?
Hello?
Boy, you are really hungry.
Not since June 29, 1980.
Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in.
He got fired the next day.
He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!
(picking up his bag and coat) Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?
Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.
I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.
Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?
Yeah. (pointing at Elaine as he goes into the bedroom)
Oh, I'm delighted.
(waving the key) You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!
Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. (Kramer picks up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.) Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! (Kramer starts filling a pot with water.) What are you doing with that?
What calls?!
You said "gloves"...
I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.
That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
Gwen! How'd you know I was here?
They really stick to that understudy rule.
No I haven't seen it yet.
you know I'd like to hear about this job of yours
No tippy toe.
I kinda like this opera crowd, I feel tough... Anybody else got a problem?
Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
So lemme ask you this how long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night.
So you're enjoying the not enjoying.
Elaine...
Dylan Murphy.
Well, you picked out a rooster.
Nice looking fellow.
(cuts in) A nude model.
Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?
I don't know.
You're throwin' this out??
Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, "This is good, who is this? I like this person". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, (pretending to wake up) "Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!"
Give me another shot!
Hey I don't even want the pen now!
We made plans.
It's been three days already, forget about Lupe.
Where'd you get plans?
Oh, no, no, no, wait a second, wait a second th-th-that--
Kramer, I can't believe we're grave robbers.
(frustrated, to self) The whole system is breakin' down!
Right.
You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.
Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 650 AM tomorrow morning.
I'm trying.
It's your fault!
How many sweaters you got on?
It has a certain understated stupidity.
Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.
What?
Hello.
Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
What is it?
I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.
Oh?
Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.
You ever go to Camp Tiyoga?
(leaving too) Yeah. Yeah.
Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerrys office. (Elaine is looking confused). Were going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean hes already left?
Hmm..
Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.
No. Things pop into your head. You?
Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.
(gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!
I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
Did you call me a wuss?
Hi.
Nah. Ill just wear the pajamas.
So then what?
When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion.
Actually, I haven't heard from 'em yet.
AH, GOOD FOR YOU.
How much?
You're passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago!
The Drake is great!
Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.
What are you telling him for?
What?
Hey.
What am I saying?
Elaine? Wh..what's going on?
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.
Oh, nothing happened, you know, but is was great.
Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.
(Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla.
What'ya do with the one you took?
hello. Oh, hi. What's happening?  what? oh um, sure,  um, yeah, okay, uh. I'll see you then. Yeah, yeah, Bye.
Okay...
Could you excuse us please?
Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do?
I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go "Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!"
Everybody's got them.
My cable hook-up? What about it?
Stolen?
Hey, are you still wearing those things.
Its a good mirror. (They look at their menus.) So, what are you gettin?
I cant believe Im gonna do this. (Jerry opens the door and exits the dressing room. He walks over to Bania)
(giving up) Check.
Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton. **
Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment.
I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man.
What does that mean?
Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?
I'll get you another one just like it!
I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.
Elaine, see this T-shirt, six years I've had this T-shirt. It's my best one, I call him Golden Boy.
(sarcastic) Thanks for stopping!
Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars?
Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?
When George was growing up..
Yup.
Why are you shouting?
Come on...
Oh, I was just looking for er, some... gum or... mint.
I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no.
c'mon ,c'mon....
Okay, just hand that over, please.
I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?
It's just hair.
I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.
Hey Georgie!
I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.
No.
Yeah.
For the apartment.
What are you doing here?
Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.
yeah,
I'm just not getting any hot water.
(to Kramer) Oh! Shut up!!!
What arrangement?
Hang on.
What, your sad little horsies, the house with the little curl of smoke, the sunflower with the smiley face. the transparent cube... (as she leaves)
I had to do it.
Oh, I didn't do anything.
They'll give us water in there.
What is going on?
Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?
They're nobody.
It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.
I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...
Why not you call him Maestro.
Yeah.
I dont know. He said hed call back.
What?
Well, it's kinda silly, but..
David!
May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" across the painting)
They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
Yeah...
Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?
No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt.
The average person in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.
You took your pants off?
"Why?"
Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we play one for all the marbles?
I told it. (Answers the buzzer) Ya?
Oh, hey Mike.
Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man.
Yes, we have.
What do you do?
Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..
C'mon, c'mon.
What's the matter with you?
How's the...sexual chemistry?
Uhm, hold, hold on a second. (pauses counting) I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.
George, does your father speak Korean?
(Saddened) Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.
Yeah, hes nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper up to Jerry.) I know, I know. Its down again.
c'mon, c'mon....
It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.
Oh Yeah we went way out and wild.
(Looking down at the shirt; mumbling) Oh, thank you.
To spite my parents?
hey where were you last night? I looked for you, I didn't see you
Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!
You're turning.
So, you're actually considering it?
I know.
Sorry about that.
(leaving) You two keep an eye on each other?
Who goes *anywhere* with Newman?!
Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.
Okay, how about this I'm in my apartment, you come in.
(Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.
Hey! So, wheres my money?
I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)
Something, isn't it?
Ah, yeah.. I know.
Yeah.
(shocked) Broke even.
C'mon!
Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.
Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.
I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone.
Why?
Yeah, that's right.
(Pointing) I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.
What d'you mean, could've?
So, you like him.
Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!
No.
Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?
Not bad!
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh!!!!!!
Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman...
No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.
You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...
Yeah.
What you do say about a guy like this, huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. But your loyalty is beyond question.
well
Sure.
I don't mind at all. Why should I mind? What did he say?
(Sarcastic) Oh, I'm sure she'll come around.
Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's got this strangest habit. She eats her peas one at a time. You've never seen anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. I mean, we've had dinner other times. I've seen her eat Corn Niblets. But she scooped them.
Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.
The Dentist?
A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?
My car's in the shop.
For crying out loud, He's Superman. (Fulton stops laughing, Jerry's face is stunned) Fulton? (looks at him) Fulton?
Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.
(taking out his wallet and handing over bills grudgingly) Fifty dollars.
Boy, do you smell something?
"We"? Since when are you a writer?
How'd it go?
(Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.
Why not?
Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they want
Then what was it?
Oh, we all hated him.
So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) "Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again." They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system..."Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to the plane in my apartment." You see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet "hide-a-key" under the wing..."maybe he left it up there somewhere..."
Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?
how can u say things like that over the phone?
Well, so that's that.
Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.
"Well...........you know....."
So the picture worked. Amazing!
Yeah
Yeah, I-I know...
Yeah.
What, you got a problem with the pen now?
He looks like a Peanuts character.
Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.
That's what's so fascinating.
You should have her work on it for you.
(to George) No. (to Kramer) I told you not to say anything.
Yeah.
Towards what end?
You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?
Well, I got to talk her out of this.
Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.
What, are you serious...why, why did she call?
Well, the pickle breath is a good start.
So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?
Another one?
Yes.
Aaaaahhh...!!!
So I take it he's spongeworthy?
Oh whatta hell is goin'on?!
They're doing an incredible business.
Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?
How do you pull that off?
This weekend. WOW!
(turns) Newman.
Ah, hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you.
I'm nuts about her.
But you made it through the day before.
And?
Oh no, nothing.
So after the sucking, comes the weaning.
Is that it?
Come on,c'mon
Okay, one victim.
I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.
Just lie down.
Nooo, I don't. (the elevator doors shut)
Wow! Zanadu . No wonder youre putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) May I?
How is it a write off?
Are we going out?
I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.
Why don't you just get rid of it?
No. I'm not really looking.
Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.
Nobody you know...
I'M NOT DOING YOUR BITS!!
I thought you said you were a good driver!
(To Assistant) Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.
We'll eat it in the movie.
(looking shocked) Really? When?
No.
I mean I'm happy sometimes, but-but not now.
If there's a serial killer lose in your neighborhood, it seems like the safest thing is to be the neighbor. They never kill the neighbor. The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right? "Oh, he was kind of quiet." I love these neighbors. They're never disturbed by the sounds of murdering, just stereo. Chain saws, people screaming, fine. Just keep the music down. And all these women who always fall in love with the serial killer. They write to him in prison. Here's a woman that's hard to disappoint. I guess she's only upset when she finds out he's stopped killing people and she goes "You know sometimes I feel like I don't even know who you are anymore".
Yeah, but why would you... (Kramer is eating a peach then disgusted he spits it out) Bad peach?
Yeah.
How do you oversleep at the Olympics...?
We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident.
Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.
Gee thanks! Thanks a lot!
Then what?
(Handing her a small bottle) Here, drink this.
(Smiling to himself) Beautiful.
I'm going.
Alright, shut up, here they come.
Pretty good. I think she might be the one.
Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.
Well, I am sure I had a good reason.
Oh, how can you be so sure?
What?
What is it?
Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, they'll believe us.
Yes. Right above me.
You got sorbitant sesquioliate?
(interrupts) I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.
Yeah. I want that coat. (Jerry opens his wallet, looking for the dry-cleaning ticket)
Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes.
I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.
No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.
Oh my god, he knows. (Jerry and Gino scrambling) Go. (yelling to the door) One second.
And by then you've lost interest.
How could you swim in that water?
But its common sense. Hes got super strength, super speed. Im sure hes got super humor.
What do you need them for?
She had a good time.
Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck.
Kramer! (tries to hide he's upset and jealous)
Don't get smart.
Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?
Nina?
The Fleckman.
So what did you do there all day?
Sophie.
(to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?
Nothing, nothing.
Ah, you're out of your mind.
No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?
Then what'd you come down here for?
All right. How 'bout this one let's say you're abducted by aliens.
Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.
(about the massage)You know I think this is really helping.
Right. I forgot about choir.
Yeah, so?
No rush.
It's kinda old, isn't it?
Yes he did.
Maybe he'll write a song about you.
Poppie's
You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?
So you're not gonna come?
And youre sure the floss was the catalyst?
Heyy! Terrific.
So all my sneakers are gone?
You and your toilets.
(Adding, fake praise) Good one.
Im just a regular person.
Around eleven.
I'm looking for a crested blazer
You're a Genius!
--but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is inadvertently sent an insurance--
(as Kramer walks by) You're a master of race relations.
What?
I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.
Can't do it Newman.
So, what did she do?
I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to Jack)
Just put it under your shirt.
So what are calling me six times a day?
Whats to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.
Good. How tall is she?
A little white dog?
Not because youre dirty, not because youre clean  just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine...
Quone?
Hey, there's Elaine.
She likes talking during sex.
For what dinner?
I am a little freaked out!
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'
Tails!
I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?
So?
I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.
Yeah.
Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get in touch with you.
Well, so what if I said that?
Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.
Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.
Ok...
I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
Boy, am I glad to see you.
Yeah. are you full?
I just wanna call the police!
Well, what about the ponytail?
Elaine, stop it.
Marla, Kramer.
Well, should we leave?
(Picks one up) Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?
(Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.
They're ladies' glasses! You know all you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.
Kramer?
This is Amy.
Ask him to change it.
We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these women.
Really?
Couldn't be the guy...nah.
This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy.
You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!
AM/PM.
It's not good.
Aw, you know people.
Yes this is the terrorist bomber.
Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing. Perhaps it's an homage.
That's very nice, I guess.
She thinks youre a guy that doesnt like coffee.
No, it's not that, it's the...
Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. Its completely shrunk. Theres absolutely no way I can wear it.
(to himself) Gotta be an easier way.
She's not Lincoln.
Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...
Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.
Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.
Tony, where are you?
(Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really?
You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here. Mike Wichter. He sold plastic straws. You know the ones? You could bend them.
Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain?
I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.
Yeah, he's a bad seed.
No, just Meryl.
I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a "magical world" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.
What?
We're talking.
Pretty lucky to find this hotel, Jean-Paul.
Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.)
Yeah, that's what I said!
I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?
All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little.
I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.
Ah, just - takin' a little break.
You know, the water pressures terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower.
Do I have to?
Yeah.
I don't know. Where have you been?
Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time.
Hey.
Uncle Leo!
I dont know.
The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the other -person.
I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.
In a manner of speaking.
Yes, I would take her out.
It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.
I mean I met her three times. I dont even know her last name.
I'd rather not talk about it.
No openings in arson?
Theres nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.
That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.
So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.
Boy...
You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?
Come on up.
I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .
Dont get up.
What's happening? What, you doing, come and talk to us.
Aagh! You come back for your clothes
Yes, I know. I've flown before.
No, hed go nuts.
(getting looks from his parents) Not you. Older people.
I gotta get out of this cab...
Yeah, I guess so.
No.
Actually, that's--
What does that mean?
Okay, fine. We'll use Newman.
George...
Okay, Tim. You're welcome. (Hangs up.)
Any messages?
Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, "Why knock my brains out?"
Hm.
Im no cat killer.
(doubtful) You were in the Army?
Yeah, I think it is. (They walk toward the man. Jerry hesitates.) Wheres Elaine?
What?
Yeah.
What is that?
A deep, yawning chasm...
Because I was standing here, that?s why.
(suspicious) Well, then what're you doing?
You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.
Yeah, but...
By yourself?
He can't handle the truth!
Who you calling?
Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?
Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.
Yes it is. I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior.
Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?
She looks so familiar.
No, he just doesn't like me.
We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.
Ah, that's a shame.
Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)
(To Assistant) I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?
Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.
[to taxi driver] Take the Park!
Ah, actually, I ka, kinda had some things to do.
Absolutely.
Well, I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.
(impressed) Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.
Oh really? Elaine Marie Benes...
Well, if that's not that, what is that?
Nancy Klopper?
So, break it.
How do you know THAT?
(Being frank) Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.
Well, communism didn't work.
I knew this would happen.
One-Q? Whose apartment is that?
What does he look like?
Yeah.
Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.
You what?
No reason...
And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.
I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.
What? George Costanza, Frankie Merman.
Look at this, my ankle's all bitten up.
Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. (Holds lettuce head) Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts the intellect, represented here (Pulls off tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large piece) Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats tiny piece of lettuce)
What's the matter?
Son of dad?
Ok!
You don't know?
(Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after him!
Poor son of a bitch.
Alright, well what if we say...
Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
Hey, isn't that Michael's car?
I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.
(laughing) What for?
Mmm-mmm. Too bad you're engaged.
The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?
No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, hes treatin me just like a regular customer, now!
The Jujy Fruits?
Yeah, dont investigate, dont pay me back, it was an accident.
Well, you've come a long way.
And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.
A lot faster than that!
No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?
It was stupid of me.
No, no, it was a small ceremony.
Alright, he just left. We can go.
(somber) That's wonderful news. Thank you.
(Points at Elaine) And the indigent.
Great.
Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our prices, we'll give you the store.
To a children's charity!
You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us.
. . . HE ended it?
Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup of Decaf. (leaves table)
Right, right, the tractor story.
Uh, nuthin'. Then he took me home.
But he was squinting.
Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?
You're giving up that easy?
So then as I was getting out of the car, ...
Yeah, but it never works.
What do you tip a wood guy?
How could I know she would start to laugh?
(to Elaine) I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog. (to George) Get this one "I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest".
Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.
(shocked) Your husband?!
What is it that isn't working?
"Jerry"!
You're bringing a date to a party?
What's this all about?
(proudly) I am...the master packer.
Yeah, maybe we have.
How'd you do on the IQ test?!
Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.
(to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
You want a gyro?
The ticket is worthless.
Where are you going?
Boy, I've never seen you like this.
Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the verge of this big promotion?
Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.
Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
What are you gonna do about the roommate?
What, you dont want to do this?
(Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?
He'll get another job. He's a busboy!
Mr. Marbles?
I know.
Will you marry me?
Reversed positions?
How long has your car been sitting in the Yankee parking lot?
Yeah.
I'm not getting illegal cable!
I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you?
All right.
What? The Cadillac I bought for you?
With a gentleman caller?
That's a lot of skin.
No.
You don't mean here?
Is there, something I can help you with?
Y'know a lot of people have asked that...
Aww...
Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease?
Ooh!
Ah, you know. Im supposed to meet, eh, someone -- Ill, Ill wait for them outside. (walks towards the door)
He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in.
I'm in the book and I have a machine.
What did you do the rest of the day?
Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?
Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.
No.
Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!
So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!
Joe DiMaggio? In Dinky Donuts?
You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it?
Too bad. It was erotic.
Hey Elaine, it's me.
George?
Why doesn't she pay for hers?
How'd you expect to get out of here?
I just got the most bizarre message from you father, Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!
No, you idiot.
Dad!
Well, would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.)
(Explaining) George has become a hand model.
No good?
Where do they make yours?
I understand (not really understanding, lol).
Why wouldnt he?
No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.
A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision.
His illness is your business.
Yeah.
A bad side, an ugly side.
Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut.
So what does he care if you put lifts in?
So, you've done this?
(Unsure of what to say - he remember's Leo's courtesy tip) Hello?
So what? What would they care?
I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.
Why did you give him MY number?
Hey George, do you believe this guy?
I guess.
You talked to him?
Yeah!
Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue.
Yeah, Ill have the egg salad on whole wheat.
Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.
You want to get something to eat first?
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!
Hey, George!
(on the phone) Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.
What's the matter?
Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.
But you know me!
No, I guess shes still mad.
I know, but I'm distracted now.
You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.
I'm right here.
Uh, hang on a second, You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck.
It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
Yeah, but?
George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality.
Oh my God, the blood!
Yeah.
They're mysterious little fellows aren't they?
Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up!
When's he leaving? (putting some items into the refrigerator)
The exact same outfit.
(While digging in his pocket for some money, he looks over the shirts one last time) You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt..
Mine too, love the 12 gauge.
(negative) Eehh.
(stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored)
Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?
Yeah!
Ohhh... You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.
When did this happen?
You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.
Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.
I don't feel like eating.
(putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to Sopie's) Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship.
So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.
Wait'll you get to know him.
Last check-in, they were still on him.
See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'.
Hello is this Alicia? .This is Jerry Seinfeld.
(pause) You know, you're not Chinese...
Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.
Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.
No I hadn't noticed.
What's with you?
She happy for you?
Turn around, George.
Yep.
Bye.
What the hell is that?
That's enough!
You put blood in the car?!
It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
Uh, bathroom.
Aah! .. right. The ones from Oregon that are only ripe for two weeks a year..
What do I say if he picks up?
I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.
Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do?
You know, Gary (slams shut the door) I had a little chat with George the other day...
No....
Yeah, it's all my father's doing.
(still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.
(starting the Dust Buster) What smell?
First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.
Move it! Move it! Get going!
Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?
Oh, my God! [takes the phone] Ma?
Hey, get out of here...hey officer, he's fooling around back here.
She did?
Let's go out and celebrate! (they all get up)
What is that?
Let's check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil.
There isn't?
You know, if your future was a little more certain..
Eh, people, people are talking.
I have to go over to my grandmother's.
So you say she was on a horse?
But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there, "Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin. Well I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on."
Not even once?
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)
You know, what would be great?
Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?!
Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this? (moves his arm) He's gonna think you're a mental patient.
(watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this?
(still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.
Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. Its the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... (Jerry pushes the door shut.) ...MUST BE CLOSED!!
Didn't you explain that to the cop?
I can't ... I can't
Still with the neck hole?
Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered? (Sees the pac) What happened?
That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this?
(to George) That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.
No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 1030.
Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?
I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
(to the Drake) So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome... (to Elaine) They loved the TV, *loved* it!
Hey Barry, how you doing?
Is he smart?
All right. Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot. (hangs up)(to George) Casting tomorrow at NBC. 400. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful. (George looks disappointed)
Oh, hi. Soda?
Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?
No, I was following him.
What is that smell?
Oh hi Alex.
Yeah, one sec.
(To Guard) I just wanted you to scare him.
Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.
It's pompous.
Are you okay?
(reluctant) Mr Mandelbaum, I...
I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back.
Im Jerry, Elaines friend, and this is George.
Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!
Alright.
Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll watch 'em go slice this fat bastard up. (sips coffee)
Good.
Thats the bet! (The phone rings; Jerry answers it.) Hello?... No- oh, hi... (Kramer leaves) no, they just left... Oh, my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch em. (Jerry goes over to the window and opens it; calling out the window) Ma! Ma! Up here! Dont get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!!
Get Out of my House!!.
What am I gonna wear?
Too good.
Bathroom uh, bathroom's uh right over there.
All right
Elaine, how about this shirt? Is this okay?
Yeah, I'm soured.
Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?
I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
Joe Divola.
Let me have a look at this thing.
Good, as a matter of fact. I almost had my own show in Japan.
All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!
Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!
Yeah, only for a while.
Ah! There you are.(Kramer motions silence)
No, no. It-It's really funny. There's these two guys-
But thats what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. Theyre knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus.
Boy, that is some kick.
With her hands.
Nah, don't bother.
Okay. (shuts mouth)
I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.
I don't want it!!
Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.
You kept makin' all the stops?
So, you won't eat the pizza?
No. It's still a goodbye.
She's the performance artist, right?
And did they suspect anything?
It would be nice to care about someone.
Hold on, they think you're handicapped?
That's a date.
Well, why not?
Yes, it was.
Well, what's wrong?
I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.
Well he's kind of modest.
What are you talking about?
You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-
Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something.
How long are you suppose to leave it on for?
So what about the "Maestro" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.
Go look at your face in the mirror.
Why can't I buy my father a car?
It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
All right, all right. All right, thats enough! Lets get back to my deal. That undercoating, thats a rip-off, isnt it, David?
No.
Yeah, yeah.
You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!
You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?
(Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?
Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.
No problem.
Slim-fit?
I don't know.
He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris.
Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over this whole operation!
What if my life depended on it?
Can you believe I did that?
You? How do you know?
You feel better?
This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.
She's a virgin, she just told me.
Oh yeah, how's that looking?
No.
What? It's a victimless crime.
Right now.
So, where do you want to eat tonight?
Well I think I get the gist of it.
Oh, please.
Kramer, bumper-cars?
Okay.
How much did you give him?
So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought ... What a coincidence. We're just about to eat.
So what?
I know. Pretty steep.
Is this really necessary?
You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal.
What do you want?
Seven-eleven?
What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!
Is this yours or the roommate's?
How can I take it?
We'll be fine, what did she say?
Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why dont you just settle it like mature adults?
Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!
You, sidle? Y-You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!
Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.
Alright, well. Just, start again, then.
You're lying! You got it, I want that number!
That's right. You're emotional.
They're hands!
I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I dont know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because its really not a definite thing yet. (crowd cheers him on to tell them) Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that Ive received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. (audience applauds) Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didnt even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, thats what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, You may have already won. Id like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, You have definitely lost! You turn it over, giant printing, Not even close! You open it up, theres this whole letter of explanation, Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest.
Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things about you from George.
Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.
House in the Hamptons?
You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store.
Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!
Where are you going?
Why didn't you come up with your own?
No!
Why do they wear polyester?
Yeah.
Well this is it.
How would you describe the smell in this house?
Tennis, anyone?
Where?
Nothing.
So what would you do? You'd hitch?
Yes, yes, I do.
(sound of gunfire) Pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, Pkeeew!
All right.
It's better than Dondi.
Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.
Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.
What are you so worried about this for?
You lost the 20.
(interrupting) No no it's ok. (walking Rachel out) So we'll go see Schindler's List later right?
Can I just go up?
All right, so youre chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead.
(STARTS TO LEAVE, TO HIMSELF) ...Kramer
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.
Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage.
What're you doing here?
Wow! So...?
A mental institution?
What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't respect salad eaters.
(doing the voice) La la la.
What do you mean you show up?
(having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.
Well thank you very much, it's about time.
oh you think she's Erika, the phone sex woman
Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?
What?
Oh.
You gotta wake him up!
You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.
I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.
"Hey! Hey! Watch it.!... You're drooling all over the floor. How much Novocaine did that guy give you."
Hi.
No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.
Hello, Newman.
Yeah, whats it like?
(To Puddy) Ill be right back.
It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
(on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV for another minute) The letter, that's the letter!
None.
For how long?
You what??
You're not worried about that?
Hey. What's the matter?
I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.
I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.
Never?
I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it.
No, of course not, of course not!
Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game.
Let me rephra-
Don't you see?...........It's all a big scam.
You were very nice!
Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in!
How do you know?
Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that.
No its
This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...
Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!
Now, there's a career path you may have overlooked.
Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.
I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.
Hey.
I just want a, touch em a little.
What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time
Why here?
O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!
That's what I was thinking.
I gotta talk to her. What do you think?
So whatd you do?
Make them interesting.
Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
Yeah, take it easy. (Leaves)
Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am  rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give...
So I know this guy. Im getting all my sneakers at a discount now.
I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.
I know, I know.
Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to Elaine)
So what do you have to say for yourself?
But...
At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.
You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.
Right.
Oh, you hung up on my Nana?!
What did you have to give your TV away to George for?
Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?
All right, what are you gonna say to him?
I didn't call her till today.
Head to toe?
Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.
I want everyone out!
Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!
No, there's less.
(To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. (Gestures to a black Saab)
Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going "Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going."
She's into it.
Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?
(Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.
Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations.
I'm not happy.
Oh, this is ridiculous.
No I don't.
I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.
I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I cant imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but thats me. Alright
(Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!
Yeah, isn't that something?
yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas..
Yeah, the lobster'll scare him.
Alright, I'll call him.
Yeah, Ill see you.
Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!
Could you?
He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.
The lake isn't real.
Oh, sorry
Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.
Mom, you too?
Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you.
No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I wouldve said tonight.
I'd like to be.
Oh, I'm sure it's fine.
Yeah. Proctologist.
You got a raise?
(to Kramer) Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot.
It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.
Do you want to go with him? You go. I dont mind.
Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?
Sure.
The Chinese , the Chinese bald cure.
Hello?
DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE?
(no amused) Fantastic.
...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to.
How did it happen?
You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this jockey and the jockey got off the horse and started chasin' him.
That's Step Ten?
Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? To me tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. "That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh."
Bob Cobb.
Then you're in a lot of trouble.
Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)
Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.
Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.
(with a wild expression) Hey, Kramer! I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open!
Oh, that's *fantastic*!
Yeah, theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.
Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?
By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.
TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.
We'll see.
No, I'm not...
Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.
No.
What made you resurrect that old idea?
She's nice.
George? What are you doin' here?
Of course I was getting you a note.
Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.
I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
Here.
Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house  and then I saw it in your house.
Yeah.
Alright, I'll see you later.
What's the matter?
I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
He tends to exaggerate.
O.K. (closes the apartment door)
Hmm, I really need to speak with him.
What is that noise?
So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner?
(mind's voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?
C'mon. (They exit.)
Oh
The Coast,
Hey, Bob.
...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.
Don't you see what's goin' on here???... No boxers, no Jockeys...
Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again?
Yeah, ya know Cain slew Able.
Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!
What do you do?
You're not Cartwri-
Hey, I just said it was stupid.
Do I really have to explain why?
Let me just get my jacket.
How much money is this gonna cost me?
No one's gonna listen to you.
Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.
(emphatic) I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!
No I can't.
I dont know how Im going to tell him.
Oh, really. (Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.)
Hey.
Why not?
What, are you nervous?
What marathon runner?
You have them sleeping in drawers?!
Hi.
I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!
Oh, no way it's that big.
Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.
But you can't act.
Never.
Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.
Bad? (Elaine nods.) Very bad?
Hi!
I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.
Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.
You're the man!
Ya. (hits the button, opens the door. To Elaine) Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys.
What did you wanna be?
(pulling out a tape from his pocket) Vvvvup. Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your feet up?
You're a baby!
Y'know I hear that all the time.
(whips off bag to reveal Indian) Ta-da!
Well, either you see him or you don't.
He invested in it.
(seeing Elaine enter Monk's) Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body?
Ahh, I'm, I'm kinda soured.
What's wrong with lunch?
Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse.
How many session did my parents paid for?
Nah!
Patti?
I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So(throws away belt) thats it!
It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.
What?
Look Ramon, about the other day. Im sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway.
What did I do?
Not if they don't know you...
Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.
Yeah, I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her.
I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I - I don't even remember the name of the town.
So, how hot did it get?
Amy said nothing happened.
I don't know.
No, Katie, don't-- (He hangs up phone)
Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other line. Just a second.
Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure there are many people who do not like me.
(calls) Hey, I'll take one.
Yep.
What for?
(Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.
I'm kinda in the middle of something.
Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?
Jerry.
Uhh...
Hey, Assman!
Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity.
Well, what about Susan?
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.
yeah, it's a damn shame, a damn shame!
Defence? Please. ...They need speed.
Yeah! It's a doodle.
Maybe I didnt want to talk to him.
Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Jerry hugs Kramer, then grabs him by the cheeks.) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think Im in the clear here. Elaines not moving in. I dont have to confront her. She has no idea I never wanted her to move in. Im golden!
You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters.
Hello. Anybody?
Yeah, good idea.
Well Cindy, the place looks great.
She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?
Oh God, it's Joe Devola.
All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.
My moms down in Florida. Shes got uh one of those condos. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?
I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
Oh, no. Its not that I dont think you can. I know that you cant, and Im positive that you wont.
I think that's for the best.
..Yeah.
I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad?
All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a specimen.
No. The sex was fabulous.
He really did an amazing job. Look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid! (Jerry opens refrigerator.) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups! Come here, look at this. (He gets on his knees and points.) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there?! He must be like Rubber Man!
Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.
(taking off his jacket) Slaughtered. Wiped the floor with 'em and (hanging up jacket) not only that, the money was unbelievable.
Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
You dont think it mightve had anything to do with that?
Aw, these are really strong glasses.
Yeah.
Don't spell.
What if she's got no interest in you?
Oh, it's comin'. - Here ya' go.
He's good, you're not.
Hello.
Used?
So you just pretended it didnt bother you?
(To Nina) Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy, huh?
We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked.
George, the man wept.
(wistful) I don't know, I just see you guys together.
Well put something down, youre taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac and Artie, theyre all coming over here before the wedding?
(Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?
Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?
No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.
I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble. I'll do it myself.
I don't know? Consomm or something.
(shakes his head) I'm very sorry. (closing the door on Phil. Jerry smiles and shrugs apologetically as Phil stares at them through the glass)
Come on up.
Get your finger out of my face.
Yeah, its some place down in the village.
Okay. Thanks.
paper goods?
How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?
Well, you know. I mean... I dunno.
(Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.
Hey.
No, I want the picture back.
Really?
Got it.
Gimme that rye!)
What?
No, he was on his regular bed.
Yes, Ill be stopping.
So he's been lying to me for two months?!
Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)
I don't have any change. You've got any change?
Hey.
Ya?
(annoyed) Ma, will you go already?
I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
What?
No.
The Saab factory?
So what?
Don't worry Lois. I'll think of something.
Say something funny.
Yeah, uh, I'll see you later.
It's a little ...
Hey. How was the Rainbow Room?
You know, I think I'll just take the check.
How could you not care?
No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. Maybe we should ask him.
Hi.
Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How many of those did we go to?
Oh Moses smell the roses.
No one knows.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's Jerry.
He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about "Jerry."
it can't be
Hello, uncle Leo!
Oh, well here. Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it again.
Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. (indicating) Come on in. You got the cigars?
This one?
"Jimmy?
All right, Ill be back.
Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?
Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. You had to give him a box of cigars.
Well, well, well...
Kramer. (boom sound)
All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar).
Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar!
You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.
Hey, I thought you went to the game.
Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?
Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?
Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.
Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?
No! There's no T-bone!
"Really!"
Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.
He's the same!
You remember Elaine.
What are you talking about?
(subdued, almost somber) Hello. Welcome back.
That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
Oh.
(still bossy) Did you just order coffee?
Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing?
Y'know, I think I'll pass on the "Guys And Dolls"...
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
Well you can't take her maybe you can't take me either.
Well, look at this guy. Look, hes got everything, hes got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners.  This is not his first load.
Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?
Ma.
Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?
Ya what was this? (HE IMITATES MOHEL'S FLINCHING)
But I don't wanna be a cowboy!
Well, well, why are you getting rid of your refrigerator? (he gets up from the table and carries a dish into the kitchen)
Well, just
You look like you could use a...
Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.
I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.
Who is it?
Keys?!
Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.
You're still with the pact?
Go again?
How much?
Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.
(aghast) Four in the morning?!
(Noting) You know, I've never seen you drive.
For a date?
Oh yeah? What did he say?
There's a giant parrot in the hallway.
I got it! (snaps his fingers) We give the keys to Elaine.
Yeah, it's funny!
Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday.
I don't know
She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.
So, she got you to join a book club?
(throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?
Ya how was it?
Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.
You look like Brenda Starr.
That madman is trying to kill me.
Really?
What are you gonna do with it?
Ah, it's just a car.
Alright Kramer, enough of this. Let's go find George.
And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
Oh yeah, Sfuzi? I- I've gotta do that.
The way I feel when I go places with you? (Kramer enters.) Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?
Hey George, there she is again. ...
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!
I'll pay for it.
I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight....
What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.
For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.
There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.
Remember Peter?
But....
Yes, the hole!
Try Elaine.
What do we got?
How's the gas situation?
Yeah
I do a wash.
Into the patient, *literally*!
So, you play tennis?
Right.
"I don't like him."
I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave.
Ah, no, forget it.
Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.
See you later.
"Aw right."
Your breath is fine. It's delightful, it's delicious.
So, you and Lyle are roommates?
George- What?! Youre kidding... Well, whats wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, Ill speak to you later. (He hangs up.) Wilkinson, the guy whos supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, hes in the hospital.
Well at breakfast everybody reads.
You're not going to open with that, are you?
And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.
No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking.
Why didn't he tell me?
Yeah.
They're closed.
I would think.
(Wakes up) Where are we?
It's a tad dainty.
Alright, thanks again.
I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table.
Yeah, I know how you feel.
I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!
Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're puttin' it in my box now.
Why'd you get him a gift anyway?
[forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell out of here!
It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.
Patty Lawrence had 'em!
Oh, please...
What is he doing in the Chunnel?
You mean what you were wearing?
She broke up with you?
No...
Here comes one.
Thanks.
You don't have a Mercedes.
Risk management?
I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!
They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?
...all right!
Bazooka Joe.
What is that, anyway?
What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy?
You got a little problem.
(thinking) Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?
"Kom Pau(sp?"
We're not gettin' that TV.
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.
I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the plot. It's embarrassing. It's an embarrassment to have to admit, but I'm the one that you see in the parking lot after the movie talking with his friends, going, "Oh, you mean that was the same guy from the <beginning>... Ohhhhhhhhhh..." Nobody will explain it to you. When you're in the theater, you can't find out. [whispering to imaginary friends seated around him] "Why did they kill that guy?... Why did they kill him?... Who was that guy? What was the... I thought he was with them? Wasn't he with them? Why would they kill him if he was with them? Oh, he wasn't *really* with them.... I thought he was with them. It's a good thing they killed him.''
(in a hurry) Yea you're leaving at three o'clock.
They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives.
Your whole building smells like potatoes.
(Nodding, trying it out) "I'm there for you."
(Giving Newman a sour look) I'm just hanging out in this hell-hole because of George.
That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The Mohel circumcised my finger!
Hey, look whose here - Puddy.
...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana...
Come on up.
Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.
Elaine danced?
Yes, yes, you have.
What?
what's the matter with yours?
You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!
What?
Why don't you rent the movie?
Elaine?
Yeah. (thinking) That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. (decisive) I'm gonna do it.
(putting the phone back to his ear) Yeah.
A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the dish and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit.
Well, I was here, thats everyone (laughing).
Oh, I can take it.
By flying half way around the world?
I think Ill take out the garbage.
Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?'
Hey.
Certainly not.
That's true.
Yeah.
Hey, Isn't that my mother's fur coat?
Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--
I guess that's all right.
What are you doing?
Can I have my keys...
How is she?
Yeah, you're right.
It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.
(excited) Oh, my little airplane lamp.
What's it like out?
What?!
"What's that?"
Yeah, I guess you could.
Lomez is Jewish?
So, tell me anyway. Who was the BIG mastermind?
Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign.
Yeahh.
So is she working? Is she here?
There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...
Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.
But?
Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.
Anyway, I'm ready to go.
Why are they settling?
I've never been called breathtaking either.
Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go.
Ah, who are any of her losers?
Course you know there is always the possibility, that she called an audible.
I dont know.
Where are you sitting?
Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.
Okay. Great. Thanks.
Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.
Why can't you get it?
No why?
Hello
Wait. How does Horneck know you?
Yeah. (disappointed)
Well, I think you're wrong.
But the question is, are you still master of your domain?
Uh, just my next door neighbor.
Im always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice. Never quite sure, Is this the best lane for me? For my life? Theyre always a little bit ahead of you, Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there? Yeah, come on over here, pal. Were zoomin over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it. The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen? Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday well be going, (Jerry pretends hes driving in reverse.) Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. Im gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.
Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...
Well I'll get them.
I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?
Look, I gotta try and help the guy.
Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.
You use a Water Pik?
You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? When I'm on stage that's all I hear; You stink, You suck. We like magic.
Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery.
I like sneakers.
Looters.
The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.
At a rodeo. Where's she moving?
No, Elaines got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and hes suppose to do it.
Nice to meet you.
Arent you gonna take it?
Hurry up George! Step on it!
Define rarely.
Even more reasonable.
Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours. (And with that, Jerry made the most fatal mistake of his life)
"Can't believe your going out with him..."
Could I just buy an umbrella?
It means "Death to tyrants".
Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.
So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk.
Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?
Okay, thank you. (hangs up the phone)
What?
New deal?
I dont want cantaloupe now.
Out.
So how come you're not going over there for dinner?
Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.
(quietly) Mm-hm.
I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?
Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.
Aahh!
The poly?
Alright, alright.
You had how many dates with him? Three?
He knows what he's doing.
Franco's no good? ...They got no team leaders.
Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.
Hey!
(sarcastically) No you don't..
What?
Cause Im an idiot! You may think youre an idiot, but with all due respect, Im a much bigger idiot than you are.
Great, I love Newman! (Eagerly following Kramer)
Hey. Elaine's quitting.
So I dont know what shes using it for.
Hello
There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.
Hey, I want my van keys back.
Mammal.
No thanks.
(Reading words George wrote on his hand) "Matthew, Luke, Paul", what youre cheating on your conversion chest?
The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. "Who was that clown?", "I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?", "The guy's a clown!". How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, "What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!"
I guess.
Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought your parents were outta town?
It's killing me. (Makes a move)
Well, theyre three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.
Well, y..you showed her who you are.
So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did?
I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.
So you didn't get the job.
You told Nana to drop dead?!
So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian...
He's wailing on that banjo.
Oh now I see. (Buzzer) Yeah.
Why'd you have to eat so many?
Well, once I didnt have dinner until, like 900 oclock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage  meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya? Throw out my garbage for me.
Where you going?
I think he knew.
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em. (starts backing away as Kramer follows him around the room carrying the underwear)
Why?
Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!
This is insane. You know, I dont even know where shes staying! She, shes not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.
Why?
Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.
Hey, Steve. How you doing?
No thanks, maybe some other time.
I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...
Come on, you gotta let us in
Not bad.
What are we gonna do?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want.
So what are you going to do?
Hi.
Yeah. You almost ruined his life's work.
She lives with her parents.
So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER
Yeah, okay. (to Elaine) They may have found the car.
(smiling) I don't think so.
(yell) Move to the back of the drawers!
Oh and I've got some things of yours here.
We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.
No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time?
No, nothing.
Kramer!!!
Intervention.
You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?
Yeah, me too.
Look, my friend saw you.
Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...
Oh, no don't say that. You'll jinx me.
Right now.
Well. (calling down the hall) Call if you're gonna be late!
Myanmar.
He's supposed to see ME on Friday.
Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.
Really?
well maybe she couldn't spare it
Oh, you know what?
Sure, dinner would be fine.
Oh, I'm back, baby.
(answering machine) leave a message and I?ll call you back, thanks. JOE DIVOLA Jerry, Joe Divola. *Pbt* *Pbt* *Pbt* I have a hair on my tongue, I can't get it off, you know how much I hate that? Course you do, you put it there. I know what you said about me Seinfeld. I know you badmouthed me to the execs at NBC, put the kibosh on my deal. Now I?m gonna put the kibosh on you. You know I?ve kiboshed before, and I will kibosh again.
Yes, I do. (very serious)
I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.
Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.
Ok.
Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a men's room. That's the end of that.
Oh relax, Katie. It's not a problem.
It's just a drawing.
Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here.
(Not believeing it) Prior convictions? Leo?
What's even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics.
Hey!
What are you, a medieval dungeon master?
And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.
Since when are you treating me to medicine? What are you doing? You're stealing this, aren't you?
'I'm not here, leave a message.'
Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.
Well this is interesting.
Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon?
I cant think about it now. Come on, Im going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.
Well, maybe we should.
Oh sure.
That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?
Ready to go Lois?
Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs phone up)
Whatever you want.
No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out.
D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?
Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?!
Okay. Thank you, very much.
Well I...
Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?
So Whatley sayd to me, "Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic."
Come on, take them. You could take Bonnie.
I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
Maybe I will.
Why were you making gravel?
And shopping.
I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
(weary) Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out?
No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.
He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. "I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"
That voice. That voice. Shes driving me crazy.
She's an eskimo, actually.
What tee?
Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.
(continuing to pack) That's a nice four seconds.
Oh, really good, really good.
What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty minutes of 'So, who's from out of town?'
Hey
Here we go.
(quietly) Oh, he's this awful comedian.
Bye.
Yeah.
Investigation?
We thought he was with you.
Oh, heh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.
I dont care about it.
So, he's a writer.
You won't.
Well, I don't normally--
Did I just see that?!
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!
It was the single worst moment of my life.
Because, HE'S my directions.
What? What?
Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket.
Kramer.
Well, I...
I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry.
129 West 81st street.
Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.
Not this movie.
You know Jeffery?
What?
Where are you going?
That's not going to be good for anybody.
(explaining) I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.
Really.
I think you'll get it out.
"Hest"? That's not a name.
I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.
So, its okay? I could just tell her she can have it?
Right there.
Oh, the Yoo Hoo?
Uncle Leo!
Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.
You're kidding.
Nightmares. You?
Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!
A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?
Well, it couldnt be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?
So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...
You mean that?
I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.
Please-
What's that on your forehead?
(Moving back into the living room) Okay.
Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.
Beautiful.
I didn't even use the ticket!
Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?
That is a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. Some guy from NBC saw my set, he wants me to do a showcase. I might have another shot at a pilot.
(Reading it) "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." - What is that?
I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race.
Oh, good idea...
That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry.
Elaine?
Really?
Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?
Really, you're getting that good?
Hello, Newman.
Um, I don't even know?
Im just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.
Its not promised to anybody? Cause shed take it in a second.
Who am I?
Uh-huh..
Yes. (To Jenny) You're sure there's nothing we can do?
You can eat it?
Well, maybe he doesn't have a "get outta here" kind of personality.
You know, instead, Im like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.
...Guys?
Oh, my God...
Goodnight.
You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?
He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them
You don't even know what paba is.
Hey, board of directors. Look at you!
Oh.
I like it.
How much is it?
Oh, he's having a heart attack.
You tip him?
Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.
What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up.
Elaines thing? How you gonna get in?
So, you're using Frank's relaxation method?
You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?
So how did you leave it with him?
What's your problem.
(getting out his wallet) Uh, one second.
Why?
I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?
Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.
(on the phone) Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Ya. Oh, really? Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye. (hangs up the phone) Well, the yogurt verdict is in. (Kramer looks at Jerry with his arms out) Fat!
Oh, no, uh, go ahead. You got a pen?
Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've never heard anything like this in my life. Listen to this.
Art Cor...
You want to go to Mendys, Ill take you to Mendys.
Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.
All right
I didn't care.
So what?
Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard.
Ah, it's just money.
I gave your ticket to Horneck.
Absolutely. Nikki!
The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.
(giggling)
Crazy like a man.
They still do that play?
I don't have a washcloth.
I thought youre like Hitler in the bunker?
'...downtown.'
Ah! What'd you find out, Lois?
All right, Elaine but this is beyond news. This is like Pearl Harbor. Or the Kennedy assassination. It's like not even news. It's total shock.
I'll pick you up at your apartment. We'll go to the Eight.
Nope, the cop says its my word against his. Theres nothing they can do.
When did you build this thing?
We're only kidding!
Drawer.
Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined.
Hey, Copernicus?
Okay, Okay, I promise. (puts on the headphones again) Wow!!! Oh Man...Oh God.. Oh Brother....Whoooaaaa!! Whoaaaa (Elaine enters he takes them off rapidly)
What's the matter?
I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!
The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.
Who is it?
Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.
Watch out!
Hi.
(into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!
What's the difference?
You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.
"Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old married couple--" *I told you that pear was washed*!
Yeah.
I'm swamped.
No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.
No, not a thing.
So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?
The crook has the machine. The messages arent for him. Hes the crook. Why would he answer- (Jerry gives up on the explanation and turns around to see George standing behind him.) How did you get in here?
But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship.
Oh, that's okay.
Uh huh
Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???
Ah, I didn't have enough money.
But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.
I have no patience for lactose. And I wont stand for it. Um, Ill be right back.
Huh, wa?
What do you think the Nazis were doin? (Imitates the Nazis salute) That was the heil-five.
Hey.
You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?
You don't like the Drake?
Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets.
Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.
No. Never.
How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet!
Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them.
We're pathetic you know that?
Kramer you don't under the conversion rate.
Named Sharon?
You sure? You look a little pale.
Played cards last night.
I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous!
Yea especially Ziti, with that big hole.
Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead.
I know. Neighbors.
No more crutches, that must be a relief.
Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves, wanted to come home and start working on his floor.
I don't think so.
What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like theyre trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?
Oh, there you are!
My pants!
Youre kicking me out of my house?
He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket books. Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.
You get out of here!
Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.
Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
Yeah!
Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.
Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.
I mean, you love Susan, right?
So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.
(Losing it, mad) Look, it's not my shirt.
That's final!!!
Are you O.K. in here?
Kramer's cooking up some corduroy.
Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips.
Oh my god! Look what's goin' on here! She is depraved! (Grabs a towel and brings it to Lena.) There you are.
Is it Famous Ray's?
Hello? Hello?
No.
Id rather not say it out loud. Its embarrassing.
What happened?
Hi.
No, shower. So, where are we eating?
Yeah.
Hey, what are ya up to?
Two pair? Three of a kind?
Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!
No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
Well, maybe your refrigerator...
(doing the voice) Good-bye Kramer.
What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.
I think he's the same age as the father.
Hey - how was the beach?
I want to but I can't.
Do you think that's a bad sign?
(to the phone) Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my moneys gone... Well, call me right back. (Jerry hangs up.) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasnt been home or in his office in the past three days!
Well how are you going.....
What? Can't I get a moment's peace?
Yeah, here.
She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love!
Dont you think she woulda heard I was there?
So it's a nice place to work?
Hey, what's happenin.'
So what happened?
Yeah, yeah. Sometimes shes on time, and... sometimes shes late.
There's girls everywhere. I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator. They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?
(Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My, isn't this an awkward moment?
So, Puddy wear's a man fur?
And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?
What is this thing around your neck?
Nonsense. You do everything wrong.
What're you gonna talk about?
Well what about the week after?
My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? (to the intercom)
(deadpan) I think you need more sleep.
Sammy Davis had it.
What are you talkin' about?
Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.
well it's too much, it's embarrassing
Back and to the left Back and to the left
I'm going
No!
Look at the size of his bird!
How did it happen?
(Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!
All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter)
Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie.
Hello.
You know who speaks Korean?
What do you mean you got caught?
Between Poland and Morgan?
You got no waist in that thing.
Why?
Are you sensing anything right now?
Look, youre a nice guy, its just that... we dont have anything in common.
I'm going.
Well , now I'm engaged..
It was a scratch.
Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired.
You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.
What do you say?
Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over my side.
Wha - wha - what's the matter?
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president James Polk!" (ELAINE had echoed "Uh-huh. Yup." during it)
Maybe they're admiring your spot.
You did it? What happened?
I only knew you through Moochie.
I only eat cantaloupe at certain times...
Oh, well, I didnt actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into him there. (putting on coat)
No body said youre fat. Hes a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy.
I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.
You're not a little anything, Newman. So just pack it up and move it out of here.
So what plans do you have?
uh uh because then it would be all grown up.
Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again.
Yes, I'm impugning a continent.
That's terrible...
Oh, no thanks.
Im not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want.
What if I lose it?
Hey.
Pulp couldn't make it across the table.
Oh, that's nice.
(playing Scrabble with his naked girlfriend) Zephyr? That is not a word.
Good! Don't! Are these my keys?
Schumann. (George stops himself, frightened. Jerry looks around the lobby.) Where are they?
Listen buddy,
Hey, hey.
Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.
Uh huh... Yeah... Okay, thanks anyway... Bye.
Yeah, but--
Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.
George, this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on. (Jerry leaves.)
Yeah, and youre just what shes looking for too  a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.
So you ask her out.
Okay.
The hospital?
See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think?
Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, Yeah, I got this new thing Platonic. My idea, my name, callin it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- dont do anything, and go right home. Whatd you think? I think its going to be big! I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didnt work. Yknow, I bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, Uh, Hi, uh my names Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, its a Riconic relationship.
Newman, too?
I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.
Ive got a ballpark.
Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.
What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?
We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.
Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat...
I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.
(to George) All right, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend Im disappointed. Youre going to really see me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this. Maybe you should go in the other room.
Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.
Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination? You couldn't possibly visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life size snotty puppet. I guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. That's the end of the line for a mannequin. "What ever happened to Bob?" "Have you seen that new Volvo commercial? He's got a bulls eye right in his face." Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, I guess these are the two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves. Well dressed or getting killed. I'm sure there is some pro-mannequin organization that doesn't even like you to use the term mannequin. "Hey they're not mannequins, they're the life deprived."
All right, all right. (trying on the suit jacket)
No! [throws her purse back at her] No, I mean, no thank you, nah...
The uh toilet brush is under the sink.
Okay. I wouldn't see it again.
Alright, let's go.
We didnt bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.
Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?
She never sees the big picture.
Yeah, maybe you won't.
Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?
More cereal? that's your third bowl today, you had it for breakfast and lunch.
Oh, saffron! That sounds good.
You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.
Did you look at look at this picture carefully?
Bye.
I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.
We make all these plans - this idiot goes a hundred miles an hour - the whole weekend's over - incredible - just like that -
Well you've really built yourself up into something.
You walk around with no underwear?
You get in the bubble with him?
Alright.
You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.
We're acting. (they stop laughing)
Well, this is it. Im selling.
Ow! Sharp key.
What the hell is all this?
Well, you gotta wean.
Huh? Huh?
Can I get anybody anything?
(incredulous) You asked her to move in with you?
Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.
I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.
Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because moneys a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you dont care about money when youre hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, youre like the ruler of an empire. More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives. Then after the meal, you know, youve got the pants open, youve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. Theyre mystified by the check. What is this? How could this be? They start passing it around the table, Does this look right to you? Were not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?
I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...
Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?
Thats different. I didnt have feelings for those people. But you, youll backslide
(to Kramer) Who is it?
So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is better?
Unbuttoned, or all the way off?
I can't buy mangos and plantains?
Well, what do you mean?
Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.
With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.
You still using that old alarm clock?
Hello?
All right. All right.
Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.
Yeah.
You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.
So were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.
Yeah.
I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.
Why not?
That's not what I do.
(disbelief) So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?!
The fly-boy.
Come on up.
Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?
Its wonderful.
Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town.
(Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So, the last person in should close the door!
Well, he was wrong.
But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!
So what?
Everything.
Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.
Oh yeah. This can't miss.
She was looking for someone to go to the show with.
Hello.
Pinkish hue?
(disappointment) Dammit!
Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!
Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's.
Really?
No, come on!
What do you need a job, you got Audrey.
I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy.
And it's probably a union thing.
Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener - what other conclusion could one reach? (The phone rings.)
(resumes) ...you know, make a good impression.
Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.
Yeah?
Hey, how's he doin'?
Someone's cooking.
No.
(agonised) Uugh! Ahh.
You can go with Kramer
All right, I'll go
If you don't believe me, ask her.
Nothing.
Well, what kind of solid?
Talkin' to Sidra?
Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car!
Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.
Hair?
So listen...
He's the pool guy.
Hey Todd.
Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.
(indistinct) Got all this?
Here. Take a look. What, what is that?
Definitely. Well, goodnight.
That's your problem, you should be.
Oh, no...
You gotta shake it up.
(Still staring at the woman) Uh-huh.
It's moronic.
Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton.
Because you're a woman!
I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.
So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?
here.
Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I?
No you don't.
How does that reflect me?
Why?
You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back.
That seems about right.
(pause) I thought you said... "ridicurous." (Donna looks puzzled)
(accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?
Self-esteem?
SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya! (the inter- com buzzes) Yeah?
It is so my business!
(Modest) Oh, thanks.
(animated) You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I...
I love these nature shows, Ill watch and kind of nature show, and its amazing how you can always relate, to whatever theyre talking about. You know like youre watching the African Dung Beetle and youre going Boy, his life is a lot like mine. And you always root for whichever animal is the star of the show that week -- like if its the antelope, and theres a lion chasing the antelope you go, Run antelope Run! Use your Speed, Get away! But the next week its the lion, and then you go Get the antelope, eat him, bite his head! -- Trap him, dont let him use his speed!
That's true.
Anything's *possible*...
I can't believe this.
Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?
Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?
What?!
Kramer!!
What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?
(Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.
Yeah!
I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
Right.
Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.
(answering) Hello?
Ooo, that was a bad toast.
Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.
Yeah, sure. My parents will be there.
Did he call you last night?
What?
What do you mean?
Hi.
Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it.
(Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here?
(Kramer waddling out the door) Maybe you can soak in the tub.
No.
What do you say to a person like you?
They're only comfortable with *their* equipment.
Oh, come on.
Oh its your cat!
Are you that desperate?
So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, "Jerry"? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They're putting it on the air! They're giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California!
Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you.
What? What news?
Do medical schools actually do this?
I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me "C'mon Jerry, go along, go along..."
All the time. Ive been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I cant live like this. I dont know what Im gonna do. Im heading for breakdown! (to Harold) Cant you do something?
Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.
Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.
(to Kramer and Morty) What is this about?
(looking at the TV) Look at the picture on this thing...
I would like to propose a toast....Wait a second.. George! George Costanza come in here.
Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?
You also shouldn't use a donut.
Yeah...
I can't take it.
Really!
Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding.
So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you this thing was good!
You wanna barrow Golden Boy!
The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.
Well you gotta call your parents.
Good. How did you handle that?
What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says " Aw, I'll just have some coffee." There's no truth to that.
At your apartment?
Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves)
That was something.
Get a march goin'! March it! (She exits)
Well I don't want to take too much off.
You did not tell me not to sell.
Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?
We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
Really?
So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!
Hey, how ya doin?
He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?
(incredulous) You're making your own cigars now?
Hi!
Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.
So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil
I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are gonna be so sorry!
Alright.
(opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.
No, he didn't show up.
What did you say then?
George?
Yeah.
So are you gonna get him a chair?
Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
(To Elaine) It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's unconscious.
What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.
Karma Kramer?
I think I got someone!
*We*? No.
I live in New York. (slams the cab door) What the hell happened?
Let me see those. ( smells them) Oh! I know the chunky that left these Chunkies......NEWMAN!!! I've got him.
Would she mind?
No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.
I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?
Yeah, I took her home one night  we kinda started up a little bit in the car.
Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that canvas?
Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.
This is horrible! I care!
Thus ends the great ball man experiment.
....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together.
Maybe a Cadillac.
. . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?
Good.
(in the hallway, hearing the door lock behind him, turns back) Kramer!
Well, what happened?
(upset) Ohhhh, what are you doing? Kessler, its a tape! I taped the game, its one oclock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.
I have an instinct for these things.
Booze is not a religion.
Shut up, you old bag!
Anywhere.
It's a haaazy mystery.
(Skeptical) Ohhh yeah.. right.
Hey Sid, what happened?
You joined the *Polar Bears*?!
Oh. (Adjusts accordingly)
Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?
Did you two break up?
Six weeks?
Oh, you have a daughter?
I was lying, give it to me!
A little
What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it.
Soon as I get off the phone wih you.
Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again)
This is a, Bob Cobb.
He is the gambler.
Why not?
Yeah.
Oh my god.
Okay, I think you're in love!
She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?
Well, its a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.
His eyes look a little cloudy.
Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, "Those aren't buoys." (Father starts laughing) Father...
So we go back to my apartment..
What's that?
Youre you. Were having lunch with Art Corvelay.
Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.
And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.
All right.
What? Today? Really?
I don't know.
you napkin I'm dripping
Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price?
I cant believe this. So what are you saying? You didnt like my act, so thats it?
That's a great place!
Yeah.
No.
Ya.
Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
No, no, no, no.
See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.
Yea alright.
Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.
What?
I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.
That was him?
I'm going for the record.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
So, Leo, how's everything? You doin' Okay?
To the Idiotmobile!
Na, uh, no, uh, I'll hitch hike.
Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?
There's Sidra.
You got the tap?
Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.
(dry) I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw? (really disappointed) Let's get out of here George.
Yeah, I'll just pay for this.
Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.
Ohh, you got the jacket back.
(firmly matter-of-fact) Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.
Yeah..
Bye thanks.
All right.
Hmm. Not bad.
What?
(Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
Went out with George, you?
Ah, no , I don't think so.
All right, all right.
That's not funny Naomi.
So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?
She didn't touch it.
You and George got together?
(placatory) Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me.
What?!!
Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money..
Hey.
Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.
Wow!
All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.
Loleola?
Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler.
Oh yeah, shes great.
My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on. (Kramer enters with a bucket and starts filling it with water on the sink) Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.
I want that number!
In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.
Too bad.
We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.
Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want? You're not a part of society.
Should I get it? I hate these moments. Im hearing the dual voices now, you know, What about the money? Whats money?
Does it matter?
Why not?
Never seen a picture of him?
Well, I brought them up there to take his records--
I forgot about the video.
Who goes to the hospital to rest?
What for?
Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
Wow, a communist. That's something.
(to George) Did you call me a wuss?
Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.
When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.
And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.
Nothing.
I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing.
Under the sofa cushion.
You didn't go?
(arriving at apartment, sees Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from Kramer's) So you live right... there.
(Over the phone) Elaine, youve got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin me on this car, which is yellow now!
Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
Not Pennypacker!
Tonight.
Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this?
It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.
Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time.
All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now, be reasonable you cannot turn down $50 for a $6 rye.
Well I...
Excuse me?
Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.
Oh, you dig?
Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, you were right. I'll do anything!
Aw!
Alright. Forget it.
She's bald?
's not necessary.
He's bringing it.
Let's see what he says.
So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?
Really? They bought the butler character?
Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go.
So what happened after the movie?
Hey Sid.
What do you need salsa for?
We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! Well be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life.
Lannie, how was the trip?
Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business thing...
All right. (sits down)
(reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.
By the way, just for the record -
It's really not necessary.
You know youre funcifying the whole building.
Was there a red-headed guy there?
What?
Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.
Did you see that?
So?
Well, when is that gonna be?
You what?
Hi.
Who is it? Who is it?
I know.
Statute of limitations. It's not a statue.
I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.
Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time.
O.K. (Kramer leaves.)
I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.
Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.
No, me either.
The apple pie you had today at Monks
So?
Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?
Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.
I dont give out bites. I got another one. But Im saving it for later.
I'm NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT! ..
Hey, Bobby, over here.
Well good night.
Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.
Hi, Dolores. George, you remember Dolores?
I-I-I don't like the opera. What are they singing for? Who sings? You got something to say, say it!
Medium crab bisque.
Uncle Leo?!
You're not writing any letters!
What?
(dismissing) Yeah, right.
Yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder)
I asked. Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian football.
(rising) I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the speed-dial.
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine...
Possibly.
I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.
What's going on here?
Pull yourself together. Your going in there soldier! That's an order!
Alright, that's enough. (sips coffee)
What's it doin here?
(ironic outrage) The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!
(Giddy) This is gonna be great!
'...down town.'
But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.
Then he asked you out?
He took you to Rage-aholics? Why?
South America?
Wow, this is incredible!
It's all taken care of.
All right (picks up his sports bag)
Go ahead.
Ma, it's not true!
Well Biff/ What's next?
I can tell you what to think.
I don't know, it's ten dollars.
And nothing could change your mind?
You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal(sp?) before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.
Yeah.
C'mon up.
(aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?
What car?
I loaned the car to George.
Hey! I heard the good news!
Why?
What is it?
I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it.
I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.
What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage death match.
Where'd I take it?
Coach to India - The only way to go.
Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her!
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!
No, I'm okay.
Why?
Yea. (pulls at the t-shirt) This is Golden Boy's son Baby Blue.
Pam? What about Pam?
So what happened? You gave her my tax papers? ... My papers?
Today, right now! Are you in?
(as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.
Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph?
Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!
What now?
I told her about the contest.
(Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this.
She wants to talk.
You're 40 minutes late. What happened?
How did I gain eight?
Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun.
Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.
(proud of himself) Remember me? I said I 'd come back with someone and I did. Surprised?.
I don't know.
Kramer.
T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya.
Oh, it was a lovely affair.
Hey is the same thing as hello. What do you think Jeannie.
(stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem?
What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasnt the one.
Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.
Right above me.
Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.
Ooow, that was close.
Russell's disappeared?
"Looks like he gave you some Novocaine"
That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his fathers band. Hed loan it to you.
Jody the masseuse.
Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her Im sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.
Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you (throws the bottle to Kramer.)
I dont know.
"Why. You took a shower?"
No, what? Thats probably why..
Oh no.
Let's go.
So, what did you do?
Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?
(on the phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second. (George walks in  Jerry asks George) So we definitely dont want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes his head NO) Alright, were back together again, great. Bye bye.
Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?
How's work going you guys?
Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.
So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.
No. Thats out of the question.
Hey.
Hello,  oh hi Elaine .. what's going on  no he just left  you broke up with him?  ME TOO .. what happened?  oh smoking you know you're like going out with C. Everet Coope  me  nah  I couldn't go through with it  I just didn't feel ready  so what are you doing now?  Oh, great idea, I'll meet you there in like thirty minutes. Okay bye.
Oh, boy.
555-3455.
Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me.
(confused) What?!
If that's Rushdie, they're real.
Tuberculosis
Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly.
you know, I think George has a non-sexual crush on him
I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?
What do you think? It's like a poker game?
Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.
(Stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. (Approaches the intercom) C'mon, let's get it together.. (Through intercom) Yeah?
Okay.
Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.
I am challenging.
Is it me?
Its great! It speeds up the intimacy level. Its like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish (snaps his fingers) three days.
Theres one thing I dont understand. Why does it please you? (to the phone) George Costanza, please.
Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and find my number.
One second. Hello.
No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.
Yeah, thanks.
I'm too tired.
Tuscany!
(about the cable guy) Nice people.
May I see you outside for a moment please?
All right, fine. Get the soup!
...Yeah I am, but I just...(man hangs-up)
Beth and Arnie broke up.
You can't go?
but not at Dinky.
Happy Festivus!
What?
Poppie!
Well, You can't go in there it's like a gas chamber in there.
Huh?
(Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here.
George.
Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it!
Hey, there's a booth.
Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.
Well, he flinched, sort of.
Hiss!
Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.
Ya.
Not once.
I think we should separate here actually.
Hello Leo. You don't have to yell.
Well you have insurance...
Yeah. Why?
Oh, what about this one? Look at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for. (Sits on the couch.) Oh, yeah!
Big matzoh ball.
Now.
I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.
So...?
(to drive him crazy) Who is this..
I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?
Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?
Which part? The renovating the restaurant you dont own part or spending the two hundred million you dont have part?
Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?
(flips a roll of paper towels in the air) Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.
Yeah right.
Sure.
Ill give you 50 cents.
Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? Im sorry. I didnt mean it. I took it out on you. Were still friends. Were still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, Ill tell you what. Ive got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.
Beautiful.
You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?
So the door was wide open?
I got a date with that girl, Lena.
Look. Just, forget it, (already). All right?
Oh, like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping carts with one bad wheel?
Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!
So youre staying at Play Now?
[Elaine]
Not getting it.
You gotta go to my chiropractor, hes the best.
In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.
Hey you know George isn't to happy, ahh, about your new friendship.
How long is this gonna go on?
I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?
hey, uh.. (Kramer walks around a little) what'd you get there?
Hello.
Great, how about you?
Then well just sit there.
Can't you at least die with a little dignity?
Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!
You think he's faking?
I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers.
You got your shirt in my oven!?!
To our future wives....yeah...
(Disgusted. To the woman) Oh, come on. You know he's a postman, don't ya?
So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building?
Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days!
How can you lose?
I can't believe she threw out my napkin.
Yeah?
I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. "Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life." Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, "I had a heart attack this big (Holds out hands, gesturing bigness) ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear! (Puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest) Brrhht.. and it's gone!"
We can only thank God for that.
(dry) He knows.
Why? I'll tell you why.
(Pointing) Hey, there's Leo.
No, Trini Lopez.
Hey.
Open my vault?
Sons of bitches?
"Caught" you? Doing what?
yeah
Its partially you, yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, it's no big deal.
Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.
I think the thing I admire most about the Chinese is that they're hanging in there with the chopsticks. Because, if you think about it, you know, they've seen the fork... by now. I'm sure they've seen the spoon, they're going, "Yeah, yeah, they're OK... We're going to stay with the sticks." I mean, I don't know how they've missed it, thousands of years ago, Chinese farmer gets up, has his breakfast with the chopsticks, goes out and works all day in the field with a shovel... Hello?... Shovel! Not going out there ploughing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues.
(with no emotion) It's okay. Everything is going to be all right.
yeah
I went out with you.
Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strange the whole flight?
Kramer , there's no way you're sleeping with me.
You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
Wouldnt it be great if you could ask a woman what shes thinking?
There's nothing subtle about that.
It's a simple question...
Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit.
Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy.
He bothers me. I dont even answer the phone anymore because of him. Hes turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.
Maroon Golf.
Oh! Hey!
One of the problems in life is that when youre a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, I got the front seat I wanted the front seat! I called it. And the other kid knows hes got nothing to say He called it. What can I do? If there was a Kid Court Of Law, it holds up. Your Honour, my client did ask for the front seat And the judge would go, Did he call it? Well no, he didnt call- BANG! (Jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled.
Act I, Scene A..
She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence
Well, she'll still be an ex-con.
I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses!
Why'd you have to say anything to her?
A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?
23 000.
So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?
Oh really? (tries turning away in the hopes Elaine gets the hint; thinking) Oh God, I gotta get out of this.
Yes, he is.
(simultaneous) Hey!/That's wonderful!/We got a deal!
I'm sorry. Got any booze? What's say you and I get ripped!
Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.)
Hey, what is going on over there?
Clever.
Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.
Puffy.
Nana's missing?
(realizing something) Oh, my god!
What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?
Who do you know? He knows my hair.
Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right?
I could, but I choose not to.
You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.
Alright.
All right, I'll see you later.
A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business.
Well he doesn't even want himself there.
Oh wait. Ill go with you.
My mother's.
Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.
'Kay. (Buzzes them in.)
Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.
You ripped off a Ziggy?
I've been waiting a while for this. You know it's a shame Tony got all banged up, we're not gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
"I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat."
A wallet? Let me see that.
Never. (The elevator door opens.) Wait a second. Thats her. On the right.
That is the guy!
There he is. He's going into that bar.
There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.
Aw.
Bomb threat.
Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo.
Male roommate, huh?
Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.
Bye shmoopy.
Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
Look, what do you want me to do?
Yeah.
You're just straightening up or you're cleaning?
Then YOU would be hunched over.
Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable.
He's writing copy?
Can I help you?
Pam!
Why *is* that?
Oh, you didnt...
Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.
You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars.
No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.
Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George.
What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in it's path.
You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?
No, really.. an airport run.
Where are you going?
Youre imagining this. Really.
All right, then. I'll see you later.
Thanks.
Bye.
STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this? Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.
What?
It's not like you're my wife.
I can't go to sleep at nine o clock!
Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.
(examining) Hey George, you know what? I think this crest is different. It's got a moose on it.
Hum, well it all comes as news to me.
Whats the difference?
Is he still in town?
Are there golf clubs in the back?
Got lost? We went to school here for three years.
All right, bye. (to Elaine) You see this? Any thought pops into their head they're calling me because it's a local call now.
I thought we were going out.
...You can't put that picture up.
Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist enters Monk's)
Where?
Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.
I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!
Game over.
Ugh, the four worst words in the English language.
(on the phone) Hello? No, Im sorry Bania ... Im not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye.
Yeah so?
Elaine its her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back.
Tippy Toe? I dont think so.
Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?
Yeah. That's true.
Bania?
Yeah , I was doing new material.
That's why I poked.
Oh, that's gold, baby.
George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments.
I can tell you what to do.
He can't do that.
If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.
Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to give it up.
You're beautiful.
Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours.
George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.
I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.
(Getting a dollar out) Wheres your money?
What'd she do?
Aw.. right, code of silence.. how's that going?....Ha!!...
Bless you.
If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em.
Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.
If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. Hes always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess its because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.
(outraged) He's a doctor!.I mean it's supposed to be like a sterile environment."
He was good in Man From Uncle.
No.
Alright, will you pay for the cleaning?
So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!
Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much for so long.
If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?
That light!
Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.
That's disgusting.
It's okay, that's not bad.
I don't think my attitude has changed.
So you don't cry when your grandmother dies? But a hotdog makes you lose control?
George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman!
Wow! that's incredible......But you don't draw.
So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.
You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for?
I don't know.
Isn't that some kind of safety thing?
I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
Like who?
Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the check to Elaine) look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.
No, not particularly.
Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear?
See...women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel...
You don't like her?
Oh... *you*...
I see. She's looking.
(Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell smoke?
Let's get out of here.
No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman.
No.
You told me that already like two months ago.
Well, I didnt...
(Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.
Did you follow the recipe?
No.
Maybe that's why she's happy.
Why did you force that mint on me? I told ya I didn't want the mint!
The baldies
Yeah, too bad.
It's a cigar store Indian. (to Elaine) Read the card.
Jodi.
Ok, great, well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu.
You taking Allison?
I'll wait.
What?
Oh, my god!
All right.
Pretty good.
How 'bout those Knicks?
Y'hello.
What do you mean they're not going to do anything, they're the cops, they gotta do something, he just put the kibosh on me, do you know what the kibosh means, its a kibosh!
What's the difference? You never showed up.
All right, now you call it in the air.
What do you mean that's it?
No. So, we're still on to see uh, Firestorm tonight?
You're saying something.
(to George) It was a wonderful reading.
Oh, no.
Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?
Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine.
Yeah.
Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough.
Oh, I'm Jerry.
Kramer, he's just a dentist.
She said no?
Alright.
Yes, that's right.
Yeah, that's right!
(Pleading) George, would you help me, please?
All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.
Really?
Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee.
Yeah.
How'd that happen?
I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away)
Well I guess if I?m the Miana I should go. All right, all right.
Uh-huh.
well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.
Feel good.
Positive.
What happened to all the towels?
What is that smell?
Yeah.
Uh huh.
But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.
Jerry Seinfeld.
(Joking about the bra-less wonder) Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.
(Slow whispering) This is a nightmare.
Well what'd you mean?
First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.
Where?
Nope. I don't think so.
Thats perfect.
(thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And Ive still got another day! Ive got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. (to Vanessa) Thats a nice watch. Do you wind it?
(walking away) Yeah, I'll see ya'.
What did you say?
Uh-huh.
Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?
Hello Newman.
So I can see her tonight, and you dont care?
What's wrong with yours?
Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.
George?
Music?
It's not a purse. It's European!
What about your sea sickness?
You're just out for money!!
Oh, right, right.
Why do I have to go on the tour?
I just said that.
All right. Twenty-five hundred.
Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?
Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.
Fabulous. See, now you're really do something.
So where're we eatin'?
What made him get that thing?
George NO!!
You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.
Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do?
Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.
Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.
You're not gonna have any?
She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator...
I really don't feel like seeing her.
You're not qualified to work at the catalog.
Midnight Express, my friend.
Where you goin'?
Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.
You faked it?
Me too!
Well, it was the best of those movies.
All right. Flush twice.
Howard Metro.
Hey, Tim.
(scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.
You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
Im sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything?
No, go ahead, I second-hand smoke two packs a day.
You cannot buy half a can of soda.
Alright.
So have I.
(Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there.
(To Elaine) Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get some coffee.
Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.
Yeah pluggin' along.
(answering the phone) Hello? Yeah, the van is still for sale. Sure, come on buy.
I think it's tamber.
........For spite...
They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
"Guys And Dolls"? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?
Yeah. (subdued) I don't think this is the jacket.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity?
Excuse me?
Ooh, (to Elaine) case closed!
The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.
Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm alarge.
Another babka?
Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?
Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here (points to kitchen), here (points to living room), or here (makes similar circle with his hands).
Who said that?
Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)
She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
(Singing) Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!
(Resisting) Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I-I can't wear this!
No kidding. (thinking) Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!
Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)
Right.
Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned it...
Oh! (hitting George)
You want to trade me an undershirt?
Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent. It's very boring.
That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.
Miss.
Mr Mandelbaum, please.
I know, I know... Well, you know.
Hello Poppie.
That's so strange.
So what good are you?
It still smells!
You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.
Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women.
So the squirrel's gonna make it?
Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.
Didja leave a message?
Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
(Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) "Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone." (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out "Just go" while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. (Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her.
You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't remember anything about you.
How'd it taste?
You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
All right, do you want the quarter, take the quarter, but don't try and tell me it's yours.
No. You?
I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
Not everybody likes everybody!
(to Morty) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street!
Yes, they do!
Stop shouting! You're ruining the reception.
Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone)
I can't believe this. A 5-19?
Too sexual.
So I really had a good time.
Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.
Well wh..wh.what are you doing?
Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.
(buzzes Elaine up) Come on up.
You didnt call no interference!
Yes. I do. You show me where there's a can opener in that drawer. (Answers the phone.) Hello! I'm sorry, I'm just fighting with my wife.
But Kramer--
[mockingly] "Please hurry". Look at you. Look at what you've become.
(Nauseated at the saying) Would you please stop saying that?!
Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews.
What about little Joey?
hey Kramer do me a favour .
Kramer! What are you doing?!
Okay.
My foot fell asleep.
You want something to drink?
Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.
Is she OK?
No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.
Impossible, right?
I cant find the receipt.
Obviously.
Oh, you already gave them away?
I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.
What kind do you use?
Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.
(To himself) I don't believe this! (Walks over to a security guard) Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with shoplifting..
I got you an apartment in the building.
Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!
Hi Julie.
Hi, um. Marla, Elaine.
Hey Phil how you doing?
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
Oh. (smiling) Oh, that's nice of 'em.
Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?
You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola!
'51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?
What?
So, how did you get up there? Did you say you had to use the bathroom?
I'm serious about it.
My honest opinion, I think she made it up.
I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)
No, no I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like the title and insisted that he change it to "War and Peace"!
Why can't I be bombable?
Well, then you're drivin' me wild.
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?
Boy, the resemblance is uncanny.
George, George!
Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?
All right. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle Arbys no more than once a month. And in exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game, and doesnt read a book.
So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)
The Charlie Macarthy hearings.
I don't know  he's got some valuable antiques, He's worried they'll break something.
(downcast) No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
So?
I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...
Ooh.
Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!
Hello?
(muffled) Would you like something to drink?
Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.
Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though.
We got along beautifully.
What? Leave? Where? Why?
No thanks, just the check.
I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating.
No.
Yeah, that's your thing.
Is she nice?
I don't know what to tell you, Elton.
What?
Why outside here?
Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation.
It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook?
Thanks again.
You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didnt take it. (pointing to himself) This is an idiot.
Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.
(stunned) Is that right?
Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I-I just wanted to ask you a question when we we're going out did you have orgasms?... Okay, thanks... No that's it... Ya, Okay, bye.
How do you like that? (tries to turn away again; thinking)Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I cant, I cant. Im stuck.
How's life on the red planet? (shuts door)
That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant.
You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 950, I'm not gonna be able to make it!
What'd ya tell him that for?
Look at my picture!
You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.
No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.
No, I don't think that..
You are not dumb. Don't say that..
So what are you gonna do?
Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.
(pointing toward the guy) See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.
I don't think you are.
No, never.
Yeah.
You don't know?
The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper!
What are you doing?
Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...(hugs Meryl.) I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!
Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)
(Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.
I heard those doves were really incredible.
What?!
How you gonna hold it on there?
I will.
Alright, we're coming down.
Satisfied?
(To bartender) Can I have a club soda? (To Ronnie) Goin' on tonight?
Did she say why?
Seth?
You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.
Hey, I was dying over there.
Uh-huh...
Well, she could come.
Why don't you go to another nail shop?
(To George) I said I was sorry.
Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday?
So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.
Hey, doesn't Newman have a Bruline racquet?
No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.
He's from uh...Trinidad and Tobago, right?
How was it? What'd you talk about?
Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that.
What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?
I did.
Yeah, it is.
I don't want to talk about it!
No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.
You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.
So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?
If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.
Sheriff?........What's with the hat?
Why? It's our place.
You kissed her?
(disappointed) Answering machine. (jovially) Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.
Jerry, You want to pick her up?
Elaine's writing a "Murphy Brown"?
What happened with all the shirts?
Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.
Oh, yes. Particularly if youre not in it.
That doesn't make it right.
I don't know, she just sits there.
Who are you, Mannix?
And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?
Yeah, see ya.
No, hes It. He wins. It is good.
Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car so I don't toss it in that dumpster?
I cant. Im on my way out. Theres no way I can do it.
Um, I haven't got my watch on. It's being fixed.
Good. Whats the matter?
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
That looks pretty good.
Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.
Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie.
I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.
Yeah.
Ah ... let's call it even.
I have no idea.
He doesn't work here anymore.
(snaps fingers) Now that you mention it.
I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)
They're making these?
What, theres something wrong with Loni Anderson? (pause) Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it.
No, I like Mike.
What is so funny?
Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency.
(pointing) And there's David Steinberg.
Seven and five eighths
You mean he just
How could that be?
Kramer. Yeah that'll do.
Ahh.
You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!
Kramer!? (grabbing Kramer's arm roughly, pulling him back as he's about to knock)
You'll chicken out at the last second.
No.
Tic-Tacs work?
What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers.
Hello?
Really very good looking.
Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.
You have an airtight case!
Oh, come on.
Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?
Yeah.
So, buy something.
Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?
Hey, thanks a lot for lettin' me stay here.
What, what, what's wrong with you?
Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!
She faked.
Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. (Rachel shocked)
So what are you gonna do?
You want me to take an overview?
I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?
Yeah, I liked him.
You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.
I'm not having money problems.
Dollars?
No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.
Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?
I have no idea.
Really...
Yeah, I think I do.
I'm telling you.
What do you think it could've been just some dude?
(Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining room doorway) I think the busboy's in trouble.
Oh, I know her. I know her type.
But an 85?
Kramer?
Very strange.
Okay, okay.
Kramer, here!
I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!
Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something.
... this is all .. very confusing.
Yeah but theres a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet.
Thats the bet! That youre not doing it!
Well, what kind of a kiss? Was it a peck? Was it a kiss? Was it a long make out thing?
Do you know what this is all about? Do you know, why were here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about We should go out? This is what theyre talking about...this whole thing, were all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, were all out! There are people tryin to find us, they dont know where we are. (on an imaginary phone) Did you ring?, I cant find him. Where did he go? He didnt tell me where he was going. He must have gone out. You wanna go out you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...Then youre standing around, whatta you do? You go We gotta be getting back. Once youre out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, its my feeling, youve gotta go.
Why? What happened?
Come on up.
Like what?
Beautiful.
You really seemed to enjoy it.
I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it.
(cont'd) Im gonna do it in Farsi.
It's all right, she was cheating anyway.
Why not?
I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?
Why?
Yeah, so do you. (George enters with a newspaper.)
I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?
George, I've been sick all week. Elaine was too. Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes. Do the math. Yeah, maybe I will get out. Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first. Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something. Yeah, Selwyn's. Okay bye.
(Trying to block out Kramer, he starts to sing along with the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus..
(to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.
Oh, come on!
Well why are you going?
I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.
Seriously?
Yes.
Vaya con dios.
Really? Why?
Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't do you favors after you dump them.
Tongue?
I think it's off the wagon.
A half hour, give me a half our.
Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.
No. We gotta go to the soup place.
No, go ahead.
She's fifty.
...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code.
You let him fight?
I forgot to take it off.
And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya?
Get me some duty free Kahlua.
Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department.
There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?
I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.
Thats her! Shes here!
How many times you been out with him?
Come on, its just down the hall.
Everyday.
Having a cup of coffee.
She's on your turf.
What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying...
She hasn't told her father yet?
It's not that hard.
All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've flown first class, Elaine-- I can't go back to coach. I can't... I won't...
Well "six" and "sex" are close.
Hello?
They sell them by the side of the road. Blueberry, Blackberry ....
Well, you know what they say. Lucky in love, Unlucky with fruit.
Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your guy?
Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down. (To Elaine) What?
and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye.
What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?
Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.
Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
What are we gonna do?
No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.
Why now?
Cookies don't liquefy.
Hello? Oh, hi honey. (annoyed, weary) Yes, I told him. I'll get it. (George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry to argue with Meryl on the phone.) Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...
(to baby) Hello. How are you/
Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat!
(handing his dad a gift) Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.
He was buying quite a load of chicken, almost for two people ...
What's up?
No, I hadn't noticed.
Have you come across this?
Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?
I think the phone is ringing.
Aw! You'll be fine, you were in there for what , a couple of minutes.
What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.
Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!
So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry?
But your were an executive, this is fast food.
Oh, it's not that bad!
He had to use cork-screw pasta.
They're busting this guy.
Your parents are crazy!
A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little decision.
And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.
Yes , I got her number.
OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you know you are always welcome in my home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story.
You could do that?
George, you need a medical doctor.
Larry, wait, you don't understand!
It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.
Seinfeld.
What?
You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.
Tell him forty and no fork.
Oh uh ...
Uncle Leo?
Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.
Oh no. That was the dry heaves.
They nailed you on the 20 G's?
Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld.
I don't know, up state, Falls, somethin'
Hey.
What are their living expenses?
Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.
Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.
I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing.
Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isnt that child abuse?
(Reads the pill bottle) What kind of pills are these, anyways?! "For Smuckers"? "May cause panting and loss of fur"? (Turns to Kramer) These are dog pills!
Well-well we got to get the cinnamon.
Ah, Im not wearing a watch.
I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.
So I said something.
I mean, what's the deal with cancer?
Eh, what?
What do you mean you don't know?
Oh my eh, my Aunt's name is Mulva. She's-she's a masseuse.
Hey, George!
So what was wrong with him?
That's enough. (They leave. George comes around the corner.)
That was double overtime.
Ah...
Yeah, right.
I have some questions of my own.
Where did you get all these?
When you feel guilty.
Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?
Yeah, that's him.
Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?
(Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.
Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy.
Oh what, you're upset?
You said that?
I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.
The massages are out!
You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.
Oh, shes really great. I mean, shes got like a real warmth about her and shes really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better.
Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of deadbeats.
There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.
You told her?
Im not here, leave a message.
Let's ask him.
It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go. (to old man that enters) It was GEORGE!
So, youre back together?
It's inhumane!
Didn't they just have a baby?
Actually I am quite comfortable.
Just put a coffee table book over it.
Wow, Newman's helmet.
What?
Elaine, you cannot judge a person on a situation like that. I mean it's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert
So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya?
I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation.
Oh, great. Ok we'll goin' away. I think I'm excited.
OK ... (nodding his head up and down) This is it cha know
No, gore-tex. It's new. (Checks his pockets.) Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that.
Too thin?
Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?
I might need you to get me a soda.
Well.
Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.
(also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it.
He gave you the nice face discount.
Nobody needs to talk.
What he gave it to me.
Youre gonna get back together, anyway. Its thousands of dollars!
Okay, take it.
What about the soup?
I like the way you think.
Hey, Lainie, how's the trip going?
No, I don't.
(shocked) What?
Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test?
Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.
I didnt know what the coma etiquette was.
(Waving good bye) We'll see ya.
It was a *joke*...
She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.
Hey Joe.
So, how's the fornicating gourmet?
Why?
Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail.
NBC!?! Give me the phone!
I think you're wrong.
Pretty much.
No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.
Yeah, too bad.
Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?
selling sexual pleasure over the phone?
It's Jerry.
Hello, Newman. What gives?
(Blunt) I believe you.
Oh, I cant begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.
Could you move your car back a little?
Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... (to himself, cursing her) Mulva!
It's nice to meet you!
No.
As good as it gets.
Maybe.
That was our babka. We had that babka!
What did you do to my car?!
Just like that.
Alright, alright, I'll do it!!
Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?
I gave a look?
Oh screw him! (George enters)
Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?
Where'd you get those?
Well? Go ahead.
Really.
Hey, look, there's Bobby Eighteen?s father-in-law, Mr Reichman. George and I were just talking about that today, I can?t believe it! That?s the guy who threw George out of the wedding.
Oh boy, can you smell it?
Come on up.
What are you bringing snowballs in here for?
What! You're the one who ruined her life.
Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..
Uh-huh.
Ill give you a year.
Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?
(grunting as he throws bread into the air)
Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!
No, no thank you.
The rines are crossed?
Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
Did you hear something?
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! (Kramer enters.)
What happened to you?
I'm telling you, the guy took.....
Do you hear this clunking?
George - could I have a word?
"Oh! How d'you like that?"
Like this? (imitates the walk)
All right, I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else.
(In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so.
( embarrassed laugh) ...Oh! Damn..
George??
Is that guy still there? (They are side-on to Phil who is in the background, still pressed against the glass, aghast)
I'm sorry.
A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in The Blob.
Well maybe they were here from before.
I don't mind the Mayans.
(exasperated) Where do I find these guys?
Great, its yours. I can't stand the sight of it. Elaine, heres the car keys. (tosses her the keys)
C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!
Oh, we finished early.
What, what is wrong with her?
Well, I'm great.
Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.
Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.
Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.
I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
Have a nice night.
But you can never keep a secret.
I don't know.
What did you say?
She said what?
What are you doing?
Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?
(to the man) Excuse me. Mister Benes?
(shaking his head no) No Kramer I don't want to talk to him.
Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- Ill be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too.
I don't understand this..
We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.
I know. They're not even related.
(sings theme) "By Mennen."  What the?...
Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.
Oh, thanks.
The Bubble Boy? He lives around here?
Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?
No.
My show from last night.
Here, what is that?!!
Come on up.
You swear?
He can't hear us.
Well, that's very interesting.
Where's that ticket? Oh, Kramer.
So, you wanna come up for a few minutes?
Mmm.
Uncle Leo.
I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? (Kramer holds a broken Tony)
Alright, Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.)
I think you said driver.
Hey, Ronnie.
(Sarcastic) Thanks for the tip.
So, could I...
Would I have to get a gardener?
I agreed to wear this?!
Youre flesh and blood.
So it's over?
Imagine, us narks?
So she..
(Threatening tone) So, listen, Puddy. When we first started this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you want to play hard ball, I got my friend, George, here, and he can play pretty hard ball. (Leaving the negotiation to George) George, vein it up.
People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
What are you doing?!
No.
And what do I say about you?
Maybe you can just go back.
No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?
I'm nauseous.
Just forget it. Let it go.
Ah, I think I'll go.
Oh, there's no emergency...
Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!
You're not alone. I'm practically broke.
Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office
... Oh, Im joking.
Did you say, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show" or, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"? (Elaine comes over.)
(From outside the apartment) Hello?
Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched voice) Gone.
No you can't. (hangs up the phone) Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?
This... **thing**... has got to be stopped!
No, a dollar, two tops.
Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.
I'm right here. (note he has an athletic bandage on his right hand) You're late.
Yeah, right.
It's 530 in the morning!
Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago.
No.
An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. (Elevator doors open) Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. (Everyone but Jerry is now in the elevator. Jerry's still addressing them) Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?! (Elevator doors shut. A few people in the hallway are looking at him, he turns and addresses them) I am not an animal!
Dad, it's got lots of other functions.
Really? It felt good.
Well, I like Gabe Kaplan.
I mean, let's say we did.
(Complaining) No! That's the wrong doll!
(pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?
(Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..
It's been known to happen....... telling you right now Elaine, this guy 's gonna dangle that dress in front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule.
Hi.
Oh, I'm paying for breakfast?
Whos he?
What?
(taking the jacket) Thank you.
I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.
What for?
"Of course.... But that's got nothing to do with it."
Flowers?
(to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello.
What do you mean not going? why not?
So? Wheels?
I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.
Yeah?
Do I have to ask?
Here we go.
That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice.
Right. I am.
Thank you.
I...am not taking it.
No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.
Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?
(Agreeing) Yeah, we should.
Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.
Oh... No, that's ridiculous.
Seth, it's me. What's more important than catching up with an old college buddy?
Oh, sure, yeah.
Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.
Ive been thinking about asking this girl Im, uh, seeing-
Babu must be back.
How can you do this?
Sure.
Hey!
Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, "You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"
(trying to defuse the situation) Look, no-one is lifting anything.
You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?
Opposite.
Columbus, Euro trash.
What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha ha!
I can't go if you're mad.
A uh, one of those guys.
I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all.
Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.
He repeated the name of the gift?
Hello? Who's this?
Yeah, Ive heard that about wedding bands.
So what are you gonna do?
Will you stop it already?!
Yeah, yeah, take care of it. (Jerry throws her some toilet paper) Come on, George, what is it?
Nah, he didn't make it.
You're still doing that?
Another ending?
Just in time for Amy.
Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me?
Put it over there.
Kramer called you?
Yeah, come on, it's a good match.
Me?
But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
Oh, okay.
NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye.
First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.
(Goes up to it) This?
(Casually, sarcastic) Either way.
It's not here.
I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.
Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.
Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it.
Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.
A real human rights nut, huh?
Wow. The enthusiastic hi. Thats beautiful.
I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.
I never shouldve gotten involved in this. Im a nervous wreck. Im not cut out for investing.
Im just saying..Alright.
Kramer, you know, I--
Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person.
Yeah.
Well, she framed it and everything.
So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?
No, but he would've read your face.
I don't see why not.
According to them
Sounds like a really cool fort.
Completely naked?
Nothin'.
So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.
What's with you?
Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!
Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.
So, what did you say?
well aside from that from that, how did he like the sandwiches?
Maybe she'll sweeten.
Oh my God!
I never remember you with a girl.
Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?
(impassive) Ah, I'm a little turned off.
Youre already moping! Would you take the place?
Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.
The *beach*?
Okay. I'll get it. (Goes into the bedroom.)
Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. Shes usually pretty punctual. Dont you find that, George?
Awright.
What if she sees me?
(facing the lengthening line behind him) Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.
Im supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?
Hey, George!
Beats me.
What?
No.
Why?
Hi!
(acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?
Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?
Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.
Shower?
Well, go in there and talk to her. She's not going to put em on the glass.
Ready?
(singing) Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home.
He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.
Yeah. Specifically 930 shows. Seen any good 930 shows at the Paragon, Willie?
What is this? What are we doing? What in god's name are we doing?
Maybe he has money.
That's a 180, George.
It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.
We'll get a ride.
Do you wanna fight?
Bad.
Good-bye, Koko.
Hey, there's uncle Milty.
(CONT'D) And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.
With the little legs?
(bossy) What are you doing?
No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.
Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.
Eh, it went okay.
Oh.
There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
You don't wanna tell me?
Forget it.
(quietly) Hey, uh, Milos, I don't mind rolling over here, but could you lighten up on the 'not a man' stuff?
That's the last babka. They got the last babka.
Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?
Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.
Well, maybe she was disconnected.
Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell.
If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.
Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.
Yeah.
Hey.
Oh yeah, that's the spot...
So you don't care if I die.
Oh yeah? I dont believe youve seen... this.
Hi,
Open the package Leo.
So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.
Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.
Oh I see they have apple pie.
Well, so what should we do?
(getting worked up) I don't need the money.
I'm goin' home.
Broke even.
Well , as I said this type of thing is very common in show business
George, you're thinking too much.
David Putty used *my* move?
Oh, I know you are.
Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.
So?
C'mon, seriously...
Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.
You're right there.
No.
I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.
Yeah. Highest paying job I ever had.
What about me?
Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on.
Weight? Naw. Just need some more height.
Oh, did you get that outta my bag?
Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off.
I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home.
(unenthusiastic) Uhh, I don't think so.
Hi. Is Phil here?
Look at your skin.
I believe he is wearing a cape.
Yes, shocking brutality don't you think?
Yeah, I know that!
Hey Joe! HOW YOU DOING?
It did?
"Adults only?"
George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods)
What did you do about them?
I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?
Named Suze?
What guys?
Elaine, this is Corinne.
Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this, now she's got nothing.
Hi, Beth!
Yeah.
All right.
Kramer...
Well uh, whatever you can do. Thanks.
You're just answering phones!
Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to an open box) isn't that one of yours?
Yes!
Oh.. I know who's cooking today!
Mulva...
Okay!
I've always wanted to do that...
Go ahead, I'll take care of it.
I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?
Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened.
The third?
What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of temperament?
I still don't know what the idea is.
She's pretty. She's not beautiful.
Who are you describing?
"Jimmy's got a record. Jimmy's jumping for dollars. Jimmt and George are gonna get rich."
OK.
What are you doing?
Yeah, that's a deal. That's a terrible deal. I don't want to go out to dinner with him. Id rather make my own suit.
The % thing to do is just not think about it.
Who is it?
How did you get in?
(a little confused) You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables?
Really? I thought things were going OK.
(C0NT'D) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.
(To Elaine) So, the worst is over?
What friends?
Why does he do that?
Something on your mind?
Hey.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.
That's room 419. 650 AM. Four...one...niner...
No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.
Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father.
I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.
I don't know.
Yea?
What d'you mean, breasts?
I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.
So write a letter.. move to another...move to Staten Island., 'lot easier to blend in a sea of people in Staten Island than China believe me.
What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?
Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless.
Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.
All right.
She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing to George) He likes the pop-in, too.
Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. "Oo that little tail really turns me on."
I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!
Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!
You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.
Hi oh.
Must I?
Come on, Go in, go in! [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again]
A matron?
Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?
uh, well I can't help you there (weakly).
Don't you think she could tell?
No, she's not.
Come on, your parents have money.
So youre pretty much
Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.
Well, I'm a prospective member.
So, Kramer pulled it off?
Why dont you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps.) Whats wrong?
No, Mr. Field, look, really I'm--
(Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that line?
Yeah (to buzzer)
You know, I really need to use the bathroom.
How did you get this in here?
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! No!!! Thank you. (Hangs up.) I don't believe this. They've added Bania to the network showcase and he's going on right after me.
I never should have made up those rules.
Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.
That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?
Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. (pretends to pull hair out)
Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.
Hi.
I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.
First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did.
Uh - new car!
Thirty-six. What's the signal? Howbout this? Chicken wing? No, no, no, I got a better one. Head patting.
What?
Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up.
(laconic) We're already in a hospital.
All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff.
Fire drill, can you believe that?
Kramer! (We hear Kramer's door slam open and shut. Kramer enters. Jerry comes out of his room.) Hey! Where's all my sneakers?
Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place.
No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station.
Hello Newman.
So quit!
Ah, Lloyd.
I'll tell you, that There for you crap was a stroke of genius.
Hey.
For fun.
You are the Queen of Confrontation. Youre my new hero. In fact, youve inspired me. Im gonna call George about something right now.
We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it?
Alright.
(pause) Yeah, I guess.
Yes, come on! How often do you get engaged? Come on!
Hey.
Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.
I don't believe it.
I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.
No good?
Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
Drop one. . . . left!
Ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.
What strike?
So he's an eligible receiver.
She's got a fine cheek.
That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. Its like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you doing today?
It's like Im talking to my Aunt Sylvia here.
have some more, take some for the road.
...Guess so.
What is it?
All right, go, it's a race! Come on!
(reluctant) Nah, nah. I'd rather...
Seen any good movies lately?
Rachel!
I remember that night.
Tunisia?
Dad, I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.
There was another crazed ex-girlfriend?
Oh... You mean... shrinkage.
Newsletter?
Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.
(on the phone) hey Andre, get the hell off the phone!
Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.
Let me see that. (Jerry looks at the tag.) That is high.
(to Leo) Uncle Leo.
Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me.
What?
How long did you leave it up there?
You drew up plans for this?
Listen, Joel. Theres something I have to tell you...
Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?
Why can't you do this on your table?
Yeah, I saw him.
What?
Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?
You know that awning outside my building?
Is he on the plane now?
Real busy now down at the office?
No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.
Ah! boy.
How's your confidence level?
Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?
Stairmaster?
Right, Thursday three o'clock.
(Chuckles) You don't know the half of it.
Sing it, sister!
Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess youre not going in anymore.
Yeah, that'd be something.
... um ...
Why do you even need anybody?
I... don't... know...
Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. (To Kramer) I never should have cashed those checks!
Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles...
Name it.
Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.
Oh, yeah.
Boys, boys.
Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men.
She says I suppress my emotions.
Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!
Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?
Yes.
What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?
In other words, a normal relationship.
Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you.
I dont know. Theyve been in there since, like, World War II. The rents three hundred a month.
But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.
Evelyn, this is Elaine.
Good to meet you!
Yeah, me too...
(bewildered) Four-thirty? Who eats dinner at four-thirty?
What for?
Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.
(points to George) Ya.
What happened to you?
Outside! I saw him outside!
It's like 10 minutes by subway.
Oh... oh... wanna get some pizza?
I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
You really should.
You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.
Can you move over at all?!
Ah, just remember when you see him tomorrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him.
Nah, look at this. Cable's out.
This stuff on top is my friends. Could I get it done in a separate machine?
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!
Did you get your laundry?
So join in.
(very disinterested) Hum... ok, what else you got?
He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man that's some tart cider!
No, no, the--
What are you doing?
Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years.
But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?
What?
Yeah, I'm free, why?
(laughing) Oh you must have done something.
Im in heaven.
Okay dokey
I don't want a van.
Hey.
Snapple?
(Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?
Go back.
Really? (sits on couch)
"Naaaaaa...I can't watch a man sing a song."
Yeah.
Well, we're changing the rules.
Elainell kill me.
Is he being coy?
So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.
Lemon Tree.
It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.
Yea, that's no good.
... I just got a postcard from Elaine?
Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.
I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.
I don't even think you could do it.
"Atomic Sub"? Why are you eating there?
Does she hate cigarettes?
No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex.
Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus.
(answering) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Um, its for you.
We used to come in every day.
You collect TV Guide?
Hey. George off to Detroit?
Crazy kids, huh?
I read.
I'm a good son.
I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?
What happened?
Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...yknow, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, its dark, theres bubbles happening, theyre all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, Cmon babe, lets go. You come by, you open up the lid and theyll- (stiffens up, as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, theyre in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, Tomorrow, the dryer, Im goin. You wait here! The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you dont see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So theyre showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isnt your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first.
what's all set?
Wow! That's amazing!
No, no I don't. Why?
Well, what d'you think?
Volcano? Really?
Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.
Well, how much are you going to invest?
All right lets go. We'll meet you back down here in ten minutes, hopefully with the money.
Yes, well that was nothing.
You know you're not supposed to drink while you're keeping a secret! (Elaine laughs) Is there anything else?
And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.
Can you believe it?!
More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.
It's not that bright orange one is it?
(in a hurry) Ya how you gonna get all this done in time?
``Rochelle Rochelle'', huh?
Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George "Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again."
Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, its with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I mightve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.
(indicating the woman) Game, set and match, huh Milos?
I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special treatment.
What did you say?
(Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together?
Hi, Lisi.
I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or somebody? What's with this guy? (Gino looks at him annoyed) Just asking.
Maybe.
Yes. A bubble boy.
Okay, take it easy. (hangs up) That was Keith. we're going to do something next week.
(Over his shoulder) Not me.
Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum.
...what?
Hello Newman.
Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything. Why don't we all just go to Paris?
They're not making higher roofs.
It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.
Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.
So?
What are you talking about?
Oh, thanks.
Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.
You know this...
Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.
Lopper.
(CONT'D) You want me to help you with that?
Well, it's been a great visit.
Ho ho!
I didn't--
You know what? No champagne. Anyway. . . I'll see you later.
Hey.
Yeah, yeah, lucky me. (sips coffee)
In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.
See ya.
Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test.
Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. (Joel shakes his head agreeing; Jerry smiles) You know, its their annual terrorist luncheon.
Wow.
Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there?
Well, well, well.
So you want to catch a movie later?
Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?
You look like a tourist.
Bye.
Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.
Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.
That stinky old movie-house?
What was that?
(TO GEORGE) Hey George, you ever see one?
Good work Kramer, this is incredible.
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang"...
Go on.
So what are these?
I cant get involved in this.
So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?
Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle?
Gotta support the team.
(Modest) Oh, you know, the usual..
Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?
What are you doing?
So, uh, whats your son doing now, Dr. Stevens? Oh, hes a public fornicator. Yes, hes a fine boy...
Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.
That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I got.
It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck!
He's nice, bit of a close talker.
Can he communicate?
I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend.
Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?!
What?
Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.
Well women do it.
What's going on?
It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.
Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.
(hopeful) Then you admit it was amusing?
Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason.
What's all this about?
Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) Thats it. Done!
What academy?
Ah, just, you know, I don't know. Stuff, I gotta do. (grabs coat and throws it over his shoulder)
Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss.
He has no idea who you are.
Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia, watching Jerry on TV. Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.
(confused) The black and white.
Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?
Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh...
So what happened with Kramer's mother?
Well, is Elaine here?
Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--
Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?
You cant look in there, were playing!
You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.
Boy, they really do sound comfortable.
So she tought I did it to get back at her
No. Jacket and tie no cape.
I know. He got the hit in game SIX. So, so then what happened?
August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress! She never changes! Oh my god. (looking around) She's gotta have hundreds of these dresses.
Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something?
If you need more time, you should have more time.
Vandelay Industries, Kel Varnsen speaking. May we help you? ... Oh Hi Keith. Na, I was just jokin' around
Oh
How does she know Marisa Tomei?
Im just so glad its back.
It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
They really should mention that in the breakdown height, weight, goiter.
Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it.
Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Alright, I'll see you.
What?
All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---
Another Caf Latte?
Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?
You have no idea.
I don't know. Maybe.
Really, I'm sorry. Maybe another time.
No, I haven't heard anything.
Come on, Kramer, get out of there.
I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice)
Just a huge massive coronary.
Hey! Hey Mick.
No, I read in the paper..
It's a movie stub from the 930 show. George, I think Willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes.
Madeline stays here.
Kra _ mer!
(quietly crept out) This is really weird..
Oh, yeah.
So I said to him, "Whatever's necessary."
(Disgusted) What is with that?!
No thanks.
What's that?
Suave! And it's non-fat!
They know how to make 'em...
There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.
Yeah, I heard.
Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage from her yet!
Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.
Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?
But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?
No.. you?
And she said "Yes"?
I don't think it's that bad.
And you don't...
What are you looking at? (Kramer goes out onto the terrace and looks down.) Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold.
Yeaaaah!!!
Yeah, there's some sickos out there.
Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.
(looking at the cop) What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think he's getting coffee.!
I dunno, maybe...
Fantastic.
You're nobody.
(to Kramer) Who is it?
Talk show host. That's good.
Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.
The main thing is to keep the line moving.
I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. (Slams the door on Newman's face. Then tries to delay talking to Newman by keeping the conversation with George going) So, you want a protein shake, or something?
Doesnt think anyone can tell. So cmon, do we have a deal?
No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver.
Hey.
What noise?
Who'd you use? Gino?
No. I think it's Demi. (the "i" sounds like an "e")
Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.
So, what's her name?
That's enough!
All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom cab.
And gum.
No, its, its just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it. (Jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) Ten-fifteen... No, dont be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, its no trouble at all... Ill see you tomorrow... Great, bye. (He hangs up the phone; to Kessler) I dont believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here!
everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah?
Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)
Gee, I dunno what to tell you.
Allow me. What are you, an idiot?
Hug is definitely good.
Aren't you cold? Where's your jacket?
I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.
I'm sure it didn't move.
I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.
I hate the counter.
What?
I think we're still a man short.
Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?
So George, how do I beat this lie detector?
Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?
What is it?
This is Lois.
Desperado?
"Wait a second ..Where you wearing those shoes in the cab?"
(confused) He what?
I told ya. How good is this?
And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard!
Yeah, I saw the spot.
(Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?
Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?
Cause you know, I love Elaine.
Convulsing?
Hi, Mr. Abbott.
Oh.
I don't want it..
Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Just give me a little squeeze.
Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money?
Oh so what.
You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.
Forget it.
Welcome back to the show.
Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!
Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in.
Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?
Sure.
It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?
Thank you very much, that's great- >click< Oh! Hold on a sec, I got a call on the other line. >click click< Hello?
What?
Hmm.
Something huh?
Fix a screen door in Queens.
Yeah, but--
What do you got there?
(eating pop corn) hmm I love this artificial flavoring I like it better than butter I think it's more consistent
No.
Yes you would.
Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.
Yeah, let me just stop by the cash machine and I'll meet you over at the coffee shop.
Suing? What for?
You read during lunch?
Why?
I don't even know what to say.
I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.
Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?
(to Kramer) What are you doing here?
All right! Take it easy! Take it easy.
Well, let's confront 'em.
Elaine, would you marry me?
Yeah!
And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's pretty sick.
Do I know you?
Speak of the devil.
I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?
Well how did he react when you gave it to him?
Y- you're not playin' golf?
I can't believe it.
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.
What is with this thing.
It's wrong, it's rude, and it's incorrect.
She's not there. She's doin' her wash.
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.
I really don't eat it.
Why would he steal a box of raisins?
Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them.
Wood is good.
You cant believe what I just did.
Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, Im in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants.
You do of course try on, when you buy?
I find the whole thing very embarrassing.
You know, we never had one fight before this deal.
What's the matter?
You just said you wanted it!
Solid.
Yeah.
I'm locking the vault. What?
We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism.
You got toilet paper on your heel there.
Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket.
I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?
"You're turning in to Jimmy."
No eight years isn't such a long streak.
Just break up with him?
Think she wants those clubs.
Use it in a sentence.
She does not.
So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?
No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.
But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
No, absolutely nothing. (They get up to leave) You're fantastic! (They meet up with Kramer and George on the way out) Hey guys!
Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad it's Klompus.
Great, I had fun. Wheres the TV, wheres the VCR?
In his dreams.
These pretzels are making me thirsty.
Hello?
Where you goin'?
STAIRS??? There's no elevator?
Hold it. Broccoli? Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce.
Trip to Berlin?
Yeah, yeah, alright.
Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!
From your mother.
Yeah, that's right.
George?
I know nothing, but what did you actually do?
Hey.
I'm sorry, uh-
Kramer, give me that rooster!
Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.
Elaine? What does she have to - (notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.) Oh no...
Hey, Elaine.
Why did she give you that?
Oh yeah, you and your *Sergio Mendes*...
So why didn't you say no?
He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal.
So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?
Come on,
No, hes making a bouillabaisse.
Yes?
Because of Ted Danson.
The what??
You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.
Are you serious?
Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?
(rueful acceptance) Oh, yeah, I understand.
Who's Cartwright?
Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-
Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.
Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?
I have fleas.
But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?
Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.
I don't even know if I remember the number.
I'm not going to "defile" her!
Hmm, So?
You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?
I'll see you later. (he leaves with unseemly haste)
You tried Aaron, it was too expensive.
(frowning in realization) Oh, no!
But I was promised this slot.
What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.
How could I have fleas?
(Excited) I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!
Yeah.
No, it&Mac226;s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i...
No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.
What happened to the muffin?
Oh, ya' going?
Artsy?
Is that so?
I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.
It's Dolores.
Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side.
Hang on.
Okay.
Not at all.
Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
I'm not giving you her number.
That guy! (Pointing at George) Swarm! Swarm!
The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke. (The phone rings.) Thats probably Uncle Leo.
Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go.
The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
Oh, its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.
Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. (Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks at Kramer.)
Elaine!
This is not a good time.
You know
Where's Simon?
Hi Louise...
(doing the voice) No-o-o-o.
It's nice to get a reach.
Elaine?
I don't know.
(as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people.
Well, we barely knew the guy.
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??... Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women!
What blah?
How could I what?
Absolutely
Hey.
I really don't see the difference.
(CONT'D) Hmmm...I thought it was...
Hey Elaine.
An old friend of mine, whom you may have met, George Costanza, has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formally a highly placed official with an outfit known as the IRS. And as we speak, at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information. And she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise.
Eh.
It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.
That's the idea.
Did she mention anything about our lunch?
Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?
When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers.
(walking out) Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody.
First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?
Nah, forget it.
No good. Too many people know the combination.
The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.
I guess you can take anything, but actual work.
Hi. How are you?
I look about the same.
Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.
Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?
Alright.
Why? What did I do?
Gee, I'm really sorry.
Now, its time to go.
What?
I've never fixed anybody up.
Yeah.
No, I think I would have remembered Memma.
Walk away?
Oh, my God. Did he get fired?
Its very bad.
I don't know what you should do with it.
This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.
How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!
Why not?
Get in the car! Get in the car!
(in a tuxedo) So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a woman that won't have sex with you.
(Confused) What's your position?
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--
Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal.
Yeah, so.
I don't know Kramer, ahh, my concern is that ....
[Into intercom] Yes?
Oh.
But you said, it can be very serious.
Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.
*Oh*, you mean you wanna *lose* it...
There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?
What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must be something. What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks?
But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?
(to Morty) What about you?
Ah, he'd just deny it.
(Fed up) Alright! Excuse me! (Gets up) I'm not buying any of this!
Yes. And the mentor advises the protg.
Stacey.
No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him.
Yeah, the guy with the flat head.
Oh, good, men love that!
Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll *all* be over...
Aah, French fries.
Yeah.
(to George) Was he out there?
Kramer, what did you do?
Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's better than eating it.
Yeah Why?
You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldnt expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.
You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.
Uncle Leo?!
Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! Its a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!
Yes I am.
But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure.
Theres a lot of people to mock...
See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! Then come out with the regular!
(Talking to Elaine) You ate more bread?
Another friend?
No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off.
I was just flipping it, it's mine.
Yours?....You know what I'll think I'll brush later.
You're going like this?
Babu, may I say something?
Not for another three days.
Casus belli.
Yea, ya, so...anyway what was I talking about.
Home at last. Ahhhh. (light turns off)
Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.
Well, um same bed ...
See what?
Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? There's no grace period.
Inside out! Great.
What do you think?
All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.
She reads lips.
You just can't leave him out there.
They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.
Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--
You what?
Franco?
Am not.
Really good.
I didn't see anything.
How much do they cost?
Fine, if I'm off yours.
I'm going to the hospital to see Fulton. I'm not even saying hello, I'm going right into material.
Bob.
Cant get it.
(answering phone) Hello?
It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)
The one Puddy screamed at in the car?
Oh, go read a book.
Manny...
Oh!
Pretty nice.
Great!
Oh, Where did you eat?
Yeah.
Why??
And he didn't remember you?
Marla?
All right, she said she couldnt find a decent hotel room...
Dad!
oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this.
Is that bothering you?
Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?
These beans are pretty good.
(extemporising) Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was registered under Slappy White.
I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.
No no. I'm just saying.
(as Newman leaves) Newman!
Oh my God!
Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.
Well, so what's the difference?
The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?
I don't know about defraying.
All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?
I'm open. There's just nothing in there.
George?
No, no that's for a drug overdose.
Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.
Holy cow! look at that!
Shut up, George.
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
How am I gonna fill two hours?
Well, why can't you say it?
The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.
Really, thank you.
Well, who took the nap?
No break?
Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.
People are going to steal from you. You cant stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker, whos gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They cant get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.
Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.
(spits the nut) OooH!!! You. you ate these? You sucked on these and put them on the plate?
This is what you gonna wear?
I have money. I make money.
oh my god
I dont think so.
After two dates!
That's alright, I got it.
That orange dress is burned in my memory
Ma.
I dont see architecture comin from you.
(Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing is now?? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!
Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car.
We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? (turns to George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George?
Oh yeah.
Oh, that guy was your cousin! (walking in front of George so he gets the picture to leave)
Maybe, maybe
So what's this job?
Gina, do you know what a Drakes Coffee Cake is?
(Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying.
What? No.
I know!
Isn't it common knowledge?
Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.
Oh, no.
I will show you The Stooges.
Yesterday. Six-ish.
(sarcastically) I know!
I think I heard her say something about a bench.
I don't know.
Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?
Youre not
Well, ...
Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.
Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.
Yeah and?
Go ahead.
(giving in) Alright.
If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.
Nooo.
This old thing?
The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too.
Superfreak?
Course you may not see it for twenty years.
We're pretty sure.
Yeah, I know.
Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.
Nah, I dont go for these non-refundable deals. I cant commit to a woman. Im not going to commit to an airline.
I will, I just walked in the door.
So he just sidles up?
Where's Celia?
Really?
...I got you an apartment in this building.
I didnt even know the woman.
Really? How come you never pursued her before?
So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.
Coincidence? This guys in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment?
No.
How long has she been there?
Well...
Jenna's like me. She's very... (searches for word)
Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting. I'd have to get new friends. I'd have to get orgy friends. ... Naw, I'm not ready for it.
Fungicide. I mean what could she have?
Whoa!
(to Elaine) So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?
No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. Whats important is you two getting back together. Eh, then well talk about the car.
I cannot take it!
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la. (haha)
(moans) Ohhh (walks away)
I don't understand why we have to eat now.
(Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?
Now thats not fair! So where did you meet this guy?
Yes it is.
I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?
'Maybe'!?
Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.
(CONT'D) What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.
Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.
You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.
Everything all right?
What?
That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this, okay...
My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!
No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.
Doesnt matter. Whats the young mans name? I would like to meet him.
Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a, its a little crumpled.
Not all of 'em!
Well, Guatamala...
Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.)
yeah that should be real fun
Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere.
Well, maybe it's a good thing.
Oh, I had that comin' to me.
I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood.
You're going to rub out the dog?
Where are you going?
Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!
Hey.
Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.
Gimme that rye.
But they not you arent handicapped, arent you ashamed?
Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a person could still make a mistake like that.
I believe we're not...
(suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.
Ah, very good.
With the smelling.
Is getting married!
Well, it's a spider.
They're nuts with temperature.
(applying paste to brush) Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?
Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.
Ohhh, moisture?
I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!
Yeah?
I think we've worked out a system.
Yeah?
Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.
Counter.
I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I? (throws coat over his right shoulder)
No.
C'mon. Just sit down!
Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?
George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'
You're returning used fruit?
"I think so."
My neighbour
I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.
Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.
You're gonna fight?
NBC?
I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how theyre going to look at a thing like this.
All right.
It's like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action.
Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?
I know look at this [shows ad]
Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.
Of course, they're polyester.
All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.
Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?
A little less beady today.
What's with you two?
(taking back the check) Oh yeah.
Lainy!
Huh? How you feeling?
He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything.
I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.
Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.
But what about the messages?
He's a bubble boy.
(into phone) Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. (to George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!
Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, (looking at the TV) Kramer, turn that up.
Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. (And to George) What do you mean you can't tell me?
Oh! my god. What the hell is this? ..... Don't tell me.......Velvet!!!
Yeah, that's right.
Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it.
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.
(On the phone) Nina, Hi. It's Jerry.
I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.
I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldnt do that.
Hi.
What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them.
Oh hi, Katie.
Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.
All right. You're in MY face.
It is a good idea, Elaine.
Well it?s very flattering. How did you get these tickets, I heard they're impossible to get.
Have you ever spent any time with these people...?
Oh.
Thats your big boy.
Look.
"I dunno how you could forget . He kept reffering to himself in the third person. "Jimmy's under the boards. Jimmy's in the open. Jimmy makes the shot."
Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.
Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.
Then what do you call it? People dont just bump into each other and have sex. This isnt cinemax.
It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.
Ill have the salmon.
Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.
Reading for the Blind?
Elaine...
And she wants to break up with you..
Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!
"That's Jimmy. That's the way he talks."
hunky.. Tony.. hey hey hey (fools around with his collar again)
My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while.
Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?
So ,Who is he?
Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.
Well what does this mean?
Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners.
Never happened.
No I don't want ?em.
Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up?
I'm not having this conversation.
Hey, were kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?
Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.
I don't recall you drinking Caf Latte.
Oh, you're "Pappy".
hey you know it's weird because that voice sounded a little familiar to me
Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing and
What? Yo-yo Ma?
Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
Medium crab bisque.
But you gotta know how to work the projector.
And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone.
Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.
My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you dont make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life.
That's what they get!
Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?
What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?
Why are we flyin' over the Andes?
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.
Who is it?
You sure?
Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'?
Tell her what?
(Scoffing) Camp.
Who?
Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door behind him)
Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry pushes his door against Kramer's entrance]
In all of Tuscany? I wonder.
Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before. Your hook is too small. This is for, like, a muffin. All right. Take it away.
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these types of people.
Good.
Oh, did he like it?
You know what? That was the amazing thing.
I'd be very interested in something like that.
George.
I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.
Conjugal visit?
I mean it's a terrible mistake, I mean he thinks I ruined some deal of his at NBC, I don't know anything about any deal at NBC.
Well, theres this uh, woman might be comin in.
All right, what is this?
What are you talking about.
Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.
Nah.
(doubtful) There's crepe money?
Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.
How do you do? (introducing himself) Uh, Jerry Seinfeld.
Yes, I do.
(A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.
Sure.
Here, check that out.
Signed over a hundred checks this morning.
What?
(Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.
That's were they got it from!
(not amused) Very funny.
Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...
Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!
(opens the door for George) Where did you get that?
Few do.
Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.
Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.
Yeah, she's got a big nose.
Well, you seem happy.
Pardon?
I don't care.
So why don't you get a locksmith?
No, forget it, I'm gonna call.
We come from the same place.
"So what did Tim say?"
Is that Burt Reynolds?
115.
Hi.
Hey. So, keys?
All right. Let's just drop it.
(Fishing for his keys in a kitchen drawer) You know, when I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time.
Look at you, you got the job.
Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.
It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.
Yeah.
"Is this guy a dentist or Caligula?"
. . . Poor bastard.
Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll uh try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. (Goes into his room, and comes back out with the jacket on.) Ahh, haven't worn this one in a long time.
You want food, don't cha? (nodding his head up and down)
So the roommate laughed at everything I said.
There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.
Where did you come up with all that stuff?
..What about the Van Wyck?
(Scolding) George. (To salesman) Sorry, were just waiting for David Puddy.
The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.
What do you mean, you got it?
What did I do?
Wouldn't tune in.
Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?
How did she get Lyme disease?
A cop car.
Im not taking it back.
Ramon, what are you doing here? You could get in trouble.
I'll be right back. (Leaves the table.)
I think what he's trying to say is, "get the bouilla-base." (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)
Nah, I don't wanna go.
Yeah.
....Alright, alright, I saw her!
She's got greeting problems.
I bought it for you. It's yours.
Is he okay?
What?
I don't even know what you're talking about.
Fire engines?
Tremendous girl.
I do.
Woodhaven.
The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.
The fabric of society is very complex George.
There's a squeeze ketchup.
He wants me to help him move.
Let's get outta here. [to Buckles] I'll see ya.
Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.
He's gonna show up anyway.
Mike thinks I'm a phony.
No big surprises.
You all right?
Where do I know her?
I dunno sometimes...
Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?
(softly) Hmm.. they'll match my sneakers.
How do you know his name?
It's Isosceles
It's Jerry. Who's this?
I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?
I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
What?
The old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go "how do you like crotch?" If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly.
(walking away) Well, I didn't sleep with her.
So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist. You just called the woman for a date.
This guy's belching out vitamins..
Eh, eh, ah. Winona's gonna be there?
What did you really get?
It's All-Tempa-Cheer.
Not you.
All right.
I sure do miss my apartment. Maybe I'll switch back.
Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.
As you see it?
I'm not married!
Hey.
Oh, hi.
So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here.
You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is! I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, someone asks me which way is Israel, I don't fly off the handle.
Ahh! She threw me out.
Bye.
All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?
Hey ,You think that Shelly's upset that I made such a big deal about the pecan.
Ah. (makes face)
They just wanted the armoire?
No. I know what I want.
I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I dont get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, Im not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, theyre so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, thats it! Its the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we dont know bout that, we dont know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas weve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! I dont think she likes me. The amazing thing is, that we still get women, dont we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. Thats why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like Where to meet men? Were here, we are everywhere. Were honking our horns to serve you better.
Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
I think thats the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!
I think that's a 5-19.
What's the difference?
I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.
(Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!
Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?
Go! What could you do?
Who?
"I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite."
Bridget!
Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?
It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!
I couldn't
I dont have any plants.
Yeah.
Swirl.
Oh I'm stressed! (makes like Kramer, outstretching his arm. Jerry heads for the freezer for some ice cream.)
Yeah.
Oh. It's back.
How do I look?
Who's there?
Why don't you just come over?
What the hell?
Don't say that.
See? You give, and you get.
(waving his arm in dismissal) Eh.
Where did you get that butcher's coat?
(quiet) Huh. Alright.
That's it, you gave up?
(to Kramer) Hold on a second. (to Morty) Hiya dad.
So when somebody has B.O., the "O" usually stays with the "B". Once the "B" leaves, the "O" goes with it.
His father..
Ah, the sweet stench of failure.
Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there.
Really? What would you like to do?
Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.
(Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?
Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.
Killed?
No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.
Done.
It's kind of cozy.
Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?
Yeah, that's true.
What a family!
Elaine, have you been talking to her?
Can you bring my mail then?
He was trying to lift the TV.
Actually, no.
All right.
Wait, that's you?
So what.
Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish...
I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, "This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here."
And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.
No.
Fifty years they were married. Now hes moving to Pheonix.
Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.
Ahh.
So You're not going?
Well do you feel anything?
I dunno...
There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.
Huh?
The chip-in!
Come on up.
Well it's very emasculating..
I can?
Yes, I know youre not gonna do it. Thats why I bet.
No, no the junior.
Then it does exist.
What is this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesnt fit him).
Get going.
I dont return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.
Well, she obviously liked you all along.
Ah, the power lunch crowd.
I can get it. (feeling his face)
Yes.
Hey, Ray.
Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count on me! (hangs up)
I don't know.
Ah, I think he's probably better off.
Hey, where you going?
(hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman.
(Answering to the intercom) Yeah?
Hey! Same initials . How do you like that?
(Butting in) Tina Turner?
I thought you were going out with Celia?
You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!
Assman?
He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly . I would like to have a good show.
Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.
Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there.
I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.
(talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass.
No. I'm waiting for...
Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up)
Did you ask Kramer?
Darren?
So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?
Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)
So you were with him that day at the track?
(nonplused) You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?
Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.
What?
What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. (Hangs up)
No Black Jack?
He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, that were manufactured in Korea.
All right. That's it, I can't work like this.
Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.
No. I can't say as I have.
Did you tell her you loved her?
How long did that last?
What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
Birds?
No, I can't feel anything.
It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.
I think she meant me, but.
(Pleading) Really, gentlemen, please.
How's it going?
Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.
Is that still from the cats?
But I might.
Awwwwww.
Well George is an idiot.
(to Kramer) Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night. (frustrated) Where the hell is that jacket?
How is this an emergency?
What's this?
I'm not gay.
I mean, every time I see him, it's Tony this, Tony that. George is like a school girl around him
Why aren't you there now?
I mean it's no big deal. You're still drivin'. You should have been watching the road.
Would you excuse me a minute? Im gonna go to the bathroom. Ill be right back.
I don't wanna use your car.
You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?
You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.
Now here's another little rule.
So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots.
Where's George now?
Alright, want to start?
Pride?
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.
So youre sure youre not still angry about last night?
(Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical..
oh! thank you.
Yeah , yeah .
But you like your Joel Rifkin.
Lemme see if I understand this. In other words, you held out
You're cut off, you're out of the loop!
Almost.
Hey - hey - hey!
Always works?
That's it?
Okay, great.
Gary?
Not from the footage I've seen.
Kramer's Andre, he's fooling around with these 976 numbers (Kramer walks out of the bedroom) hey I told you, I don't want you doing that on my phone
What, you got a cold?
I think you're getting a ticket.
Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.
That's what she told me!
(indifferent) Yeah, we'll see.
Can I use your phone?
And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
Yeah, killed. Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark.
Well, one of the gypsies took it.
I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.
That's a hell of an organization they're running up there. I can't understand why they haven't won a pennant in 15 years.
You want 'em back?
(as Ping rambles on ) ...S'cuse me (Ping looks up) Kind of an expensive call.
Yeah, and, (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly exiting) time.
Wow!
But you yada yada'd over the best part.
Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys.
No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.
Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me
What am I drinking, milk?
You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.
Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to begin with! Let's face it. I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's that!
So you're gonna burn that bridge.
No I can't she didn't leave her name or number.
Uh, I don't have anymore pictures Elaine.
Youre movin in, youre a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars. (Elaine is shocked, Jerry opens the door to the hall.) Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I dont even wanna see it, go, get it out.
Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.
All right!
What other time?
Trouble down at the plant?
Yeah.
(Nervous laughter) Yeah.. like a pirate.. (Attempting to get on another subject) Anyway, ah, you know, we're hoping to, um, raise enough money.. with this.. uh..
Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.
How much are they payin' you?
Uh, Keith uh Hernandez.
We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.
(Walks over and starts pulling on Kramer's pants) You just gotta wiggle your hips a little bit.
Yes you do. That's what you both think.
Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- Zip, I'm gone. (makes a running motion with both arms and his right foot)
How do you stop a kid from growing?
When did you do this?
Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.
(leafing through his mail) Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.
Thats not too bad. Its not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
Did you shake it up?
Forget the sports jacket.
Yeah, it was alright.
Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.
How would we do it?
Theres nothing to get.
Ok, ok...
Heh.
Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? That's like half a pound of turkey!
Youre a little paranormal
Especially that big kid up in the front. (Mr. Pitt is shown on the television, trying to hold up the deflating Woody balloon.) How old is he? (The phone rings.) Hello?
What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!
Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.
We're going to Atlantic City.
Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Uh, gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. Alright let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... (looks at Joe; Joe gives him a weird look)ooo, just right... and three plantains uh ought to do it.
He did?
So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club.
Youre a human being.
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.
Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)
(quietly, yet in a high and whiney tone) Well, I don't know if I....
Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just wanted to pick it up.
Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.
Oh, great! Alright. (We hear the announcers calling the game.)
Well, I'm glad I brought it up.
How's your family history?
Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?
Wow! (Jerry spots all the classic toys)
It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.
Looks like a swan.
He wants to talk about "Jerry"!
How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!
Well that's all I got.
Actually, that is not a bad idea.
No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch)
Yeah, but how am I...
(to the phone) Oh, its you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldnt have had to do this. Now thats two long distance calls I made to you why cant you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again; to nobody) Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much.
(still Patting) I hear a voice.
Any Hennigans around here?
Well how long you are going to keep this up?
Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me.
Well now we're gettin' somewhere.
You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about the Costanzas'
Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!
You're out of your mind you know that.
Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
How can I live there?
I was trying to be.
It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.
Bonkers?
For what?
(thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.
Odds.
Susan! What are you doing here?
Hey, George.
Hey, where's Marcy?
Uh, Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld.
Yeah, it's in the kitchen drawer.
Yeah. (Kramer sits in the seat next to Jerry) Uh, uh, oh, oh, Over there. (points to the next seat over)
I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes.
I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?
But you were supposed to get me a refund.
'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?
Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.
Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!
Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer enters)
No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!
The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.
You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.
O.K.
Where you going?
Hey.
I'm not here, leave a message.
Is not.
I see you, Newman! I see you!
Don't ask.
It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.
Okay.
We'll see you later.
Did he take 'em?
I thought youd be upset.
Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? Theres Elastic Man... Plastic Man...
Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.
Coffee?
You must be George's cousin.
(to waitress) I' ll just have a cup of coffee.
(thinking) Uh-oh... What do we have here?
35, and George, on the invitations...
Hey, could you do me a favour? [pause] Could you shut-up?
Oh my god, its Joe Divola
George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, ok...do we know where the 101 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 170 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 134 is? (George just looks at Jerry) No. Aha, ok. (Jerry hangs up) He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up.
Happy, Pappy? What does that mean?
So what are you up to?
Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! (Kramer is speechless) I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet.
You're a shmoopy!
Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting a package.
What happened you didn't give her the papers?
I said I couldnt believe you liked that commercial. So what?
Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on?
151?
Yeah. And she picked the day!
Thank you.
Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.
No. Not Chinese. Not even Asian.
No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.
What does that mean, good dip?
The Daily Worker has personal ads?
What are you doing here?
Hello?
Why were dogs chasing you?
No.
All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.
What did you end up giving her?
Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.
What?!
How ya doin'?
(pointing to Kramer's hair) You got some suds over here.
I don't know what I was thinking.
What?
Still got water in your ear?
You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.
I suppose if it was on the protg's way to the mentor, they might.
I've been defaced!
Yes, we do.
I know, I should've asked her.
I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.
Absolutely. I have no confidence in you.
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!
Sorry, sorry I'm late.
(to Elaine) Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?
You said that already.
You know, long dark hair.
Well my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.
Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.
Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.
Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I?m the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me!
Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 630 and gimme a call.
Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.
.. and uh, underwear and a tee shirt.
Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?
What about her name?
Hey, David.
Oh, right.
So you had a good time.
Listen, Ma...
Yup.
I don't know, you know, what if...?
Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser.
What for? Oh come on.
Stay on Biscayne.
Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough!
So?
(Agreeing) What's more important?
Really? How?
Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.
Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.
Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10?
Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?
(peering) That's an interesting package.
Great! (realizing) What?
(confused) Wha..? What time is it?
A wuss?
Ah ha.
No, not on me.
Wild pack of teenagers, huh?
No, it's stupid.
Can we just go in already?
..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye. HA Ha..Who do these women think they're dealing with? Did she think she was gonna leave this incredibly erotic message on my tape and I was just gonna let it go. Not Bloody likely...
The guy whos in the gulag?!
Alright, alright. I'll wake 'em up.
Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Yea nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?
Let go, Elaine!
Really I'll be back.
Hey, what happened to your coat? And what is the smell? Is-ya, What are you drunk?
The wheels are in motion, things are happening!
Well what happened?
So you want me to get the books? Is that it?
Hello.
I know.. How about dessert?
Yeah.
Boy, It's the way they just slip it in there too.
Everybody's moving to Seattle.
Ask George to go with you.
I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.
Hello Newman.
Well, I-I-I told my wife not to bring it.
No. What happened to you?
Who?
Yeah, so am I being funny now?
Oh.
I don't know. Why?
This is Outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit.
I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?
Hi how are you?
No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's.
Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.
This is a person I like, its not How to score on spring break.
Hey.
Where?
He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.
(picking at his moustache) You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.
I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.
Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?
So ah, what did you do last night?
(looking behind the counter) Hey, is that Babu? It is! (walking over) Hey, Babu!
I'll loan you my puffy shirt.
hi Elaine
Ey, ey!
Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!
Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.
I don't know about sixty.
Well I thought we'd both be getting married.
Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!
This is Laura.
"Not necessarily because....."
You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?
Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.
No, no tricks.
Wow! What'd she say?
(tossing the ball) Here you go.
Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?
Big accomplishment.
What's the kid doing here?
Oh. (chuckles) Really? You don't seem that desperate.
(musing) What if it's Neil Armstrong?
Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?
You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. (Phone rings, he answers it) Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend.
Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane enters)
(weakly) A little better. (fake cough)
Ah, it's probably like Smith over there.
Aw, that's kind of sweet.
So why didn't you tell her the code?
What for?
(weakly) I dunno
I think I offended the wake-up guy...! (worried)
Yea yea ya I shoulda kept it.
Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.
Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.
See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.
Oh... yeah. What? I'm sorry.
Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.
Elaaaiinne...
Well, I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble.
(Still pulling) Squinch em!
This is how you operate?
(neutral) No problem.
I, I'm sorry.
Alright, alright.
Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.
Hello?
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?
Yeah.
What?
Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.
Something wrong with your chest?
Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?
Hmm.
Oh, God.
You gonna do a little yelling?
Middle drawer.
What is it?
Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.
Your spare set?
Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!
Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you.
I wouldn't use her toothbrush.
Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.
I'm afraid we're out of time.
But I, I didn't, I--
Yes.
Rachel!
Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you.
I got an idea.
Yeah, so Joey?s a great lover of the opera
So how long do they do this?
Yeah.
Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.
No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.
Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?
Well, the games starting just about now.
I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton.
By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?
Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.
Well, something happens.
This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes) Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?
What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.
Yes.
I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!
George Costanza...
Didn't you call in sick yesterday?
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!
No, certainly not.
Great.
You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples clothes
I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
(exasperation) You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents.
Mother of God.
Well, its a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno...
So, Saturday night.
What happened?
Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!
Yeah, I'm sure...
That's not that?
Well what do you suggest?
Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.
Easy?
I thought you were gonna watch a video.
She suggested it!
Yes, its my lifes work.
Oh please, I love her.
Who?
I said no! (hangs up the phone.)
Are you sure?
Sure. Why not? You're there.
Did they uncross the lines yet?
Echh
oh.. Jane she uh.. she uh..
Maybe it's not on this level.
So as he's telling the story he starts crying.
Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. (George gives Elaine a look while Jerrys back is turned. Jerry turns around.) I saw that.
Expect a call.
What about the label maker?
Well, take it easy.
Hi, Elaine.
How could you not?
What?
That old scam.
Just put it.
Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.
Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.
Can we go out there?
What's wrong?
You dont think... What? The pony remark?
You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.
How ya doing?
Hey. How's the new place?!
How am I gonna do that?
You look like something's on your mind.
You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.
Is that right?
I never said I'd do that.
-programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'
You're an idiot.
Oh, in a minute, Carol.
Elaine, he's a.. he's a male bimbo, he's a mimbo
Elaine?!
He couldn't.
Hey Seth. Man it is coming down hard out there.
I have no idea.
Don't blow this.
Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be? (Elaine laughs - hu) Why can't you live?
Absolutely. Let's just stick around.
Hey, hey. I understand. Youre businessmen.
Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.
Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.
That's how it's gonna be.
Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?
(cynical) This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday?
You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!
Okay.
Jack.
What happened?
So what did you do?
I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
Um. I'll call you back ok?
No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car.
So, is tonight "the night"?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm..
He's fantastic.
Oh! man did you see that. I ate discarded food.
There's no watch ... I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep good time. My parents gave it to me, but I didn't like it. So don't mention it again, okay!
Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, (has his one hand up and his other hand down) he was down. Now he's up, (switches the positioning of his hands) you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?
Seven.
Yeah,, me too.
What?
Nice.
Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?
Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?
All right.
For what?
What are you gonna do?
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.
Excuse me?
Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.
Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?
I'm sorry. I'm soured.
Oh, okay, thanks.
Yes. Melrose Place.
Oh my god, you're kidding. (dives for his wallet) Hang on a second. (reading from his registration) It's JVN 728.
He feels he's funnier, more relaxed.
I don't think the network will go for it.
(smiling and excited) Well, here we are.
It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.
I'm gonna ask this guy something.
I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" thing.
Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?
Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?
Oh, help me, Rhonda.
Yeah, I know.
George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long.
I noticed she's big on the phrase "yada yada."
George I'm telling ya..
That was our babka.
This friendship Its not working.
Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
What're you doing with a pricing-gun?
They got some sort of program.
You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.
(incredulous) Oh, come on!
I thought I smelled lilac.
What the hell is going on here?
All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura opens the door and gets out). What? What?
No, I asked him.
Yeah, so?
How you gonna get out of *that* one?
(checking his watch) I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
What's that?
Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.
(privately amused) Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while. (indicating Elaine) Her too.
So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.
(As George sits down) George, we need to talk.
Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.
Oh, sure...Truman Capote.
This is your plan?
Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?
That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no--
I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.
I said yes.
Fine. Well.
Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!
it's battle conditions
So, what's on your mind?
Are you saying...
Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting.
You know I'm paying for these tickets.
Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump across.
Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.
Why are you looking at my face?
Uma Therman? Really?
Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?
No, you wait for the movie!
You've got really specific tastes.
(uncomfortably) Nothing.
Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.
What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?
It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.
I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)
Oh, she had an itch.
Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it.
It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.
Are my nostrils getting bigger?
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer, say it isn't so.
(to himself) My foot's asleep again!
What about all your Jewish jokes?
I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?
It's been three days and he hasn't called.
(yelling) Yes I told him the Packyderm story!
Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than "coffee machine show."
Sure.
C'mon! One whiff!
Marisa Tomei?
Did you see that?
And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?
I gave a look?
Well, thats it. You two are back together.
I was blowing on the coffee.
Good, going good (scratches chin) And the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty good - not bad - I gotta get out. (scratches chin, nose then covers eyes with hands)
Why are the crepes spraying?
All the time.
(trying to ease the tension) Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends.
What else did you say to her?
Yeah, I know.
Let me get that.
(He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.
Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?
Ideally.
No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.
How come you didn't tell me?
(agreeing) well three years is a long time to be married.
Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.
What are we doing here..
(cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You havent been out of the building in ten years!
What's going on here?
(to himself) Last one.
Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid...
Boy, they really worked on your pectorals.
You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.
Hey, Susan, George.
Still no luck
There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
Hey, what happened to my jacket?
Ah, I should have got the egg white omelet.
Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. (Kramer goes to get the suit. Elaine enters.)
Oh hi.
(Out of it) Yeah, good morning.
Im not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. Ive decided Ill do the work. Im gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? Cause you send your money out there  working for you  a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me. Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.
So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.
Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?
I didnt tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog?
Wonder about what?
Oh! my God!....
Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!
Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog strangler. (George leans close) would you suck a mint or something. Can I come right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where we are. Where are we?
You told him you knew Simons?
(Surprised) Huh?
Momentum - same thing.
Hey. What's all this?
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, that?s not fair, what about George, Susan and Elaine, what do you need me for?
He's definitely in Chicago.
I dont get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?
So then we went to dinner.
We don't know!
Why would I leave? This is my apartment.
Yeah...
I have to do what?
Oh.
Yes
All right, let me ask you this when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?
He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?
What's around you?
You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...
The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.
Whom I gonna tell?
All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! (Audience boos)
The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?
I hope so.
I can't do those things.
He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.
Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.
Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno.
What?
He went to get some steak sauce. Why?
Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)
Few hundred grand?
Hey. What are you doing?
Were you talking? I couldn't hear anything.
'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'.
He said wuss?
"So what about the Penthouse. Did you ask him?"
(louder) Bob!
Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?
(Cheerfully) Well, a law's a law. (Leaves)
Cranberry juice?
Were taking Elaine to dinner. Shes got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?
(He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.
And they said they can do it?
So call now.
But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.
Is that like the end of the world or something?
It-it rhymes with a female body part.
you're making sandwiches?
Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.
(turning to Kramer) That's nice for the freaks.
Meat? I dont, I dont know, go... hunt! (Kessler opens the refrigerator and sticks his head in.) Well what happened in the game anyway?
I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!
I was kind of um (pauses) making out.
I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship?
Youre an architect?
Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.
Why?
Okay, okay. Forget it. Its okay. I didnt mean it.
Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!
The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.
Yes. (kisses Nana) Yes of course.
The virgin!
Wizards!
No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)
Oh, right.
This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!
Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?
Nice shotgun.
Youre too nice a guy.
So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?
When did they ever spend any money?
Well you might as well look it over.
Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere... I got my bags, I'm ready to go.
So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?
No, let's just do it. (Fire alarm goes off) What? What is going on? What is that about?
But -
Sure, fine with me.
Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.
Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, "Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land." (Imitates cannon operator) "I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you."
Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it.
Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.
And there's so much more to go.
Babu!
(tucking in his shirt) Oh ya this is Rachel.
Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.
Leo?
An assembly?
Aww!
(pause) You're Donna Chang?
Well there's spaces there, they must drive!
Be careful Kramer.
What do you mean?
Hmm. So you feel "women and children first," in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.
I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.
No, Im fine.
So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right?
(Fast) Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me!
An overdose of odor? Good question.
All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.
(starts pulling them apart) Alright break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells)
No Elaine he's normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York.
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..
Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
You're getting married?
Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.
Should we walk him around?
Hey.
[his interest piqued] Minsk?
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers...
Y-You didnt do anything. Its not you, its me. Its- this is very difficult.
It's not going to happen.
Hi.
Done.
I knew it.
Yeah.
Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead.
Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.
Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here.
'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off the table.
They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?
alright that's enough
Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.
Yes it will, now give me those keys!
Well, looks are so subjective.
This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.
'Pottery Barn'?
She sees something in him.
A smirk?
I don't know, but we don't have much time.
My foot fell asleep.
Uncle Leo, wait!
No.
Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth.
I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.
What?
Morning.
Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?
Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer. It shows at least he's making an effort.
Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame.
Just imagine how much more you'll accomplish.
I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that couldn't be.
Whatever you want me to tell them.
Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.
Spring. Of course.
Cigars!
You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.
Ya, I could see that.
Alright.
So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?
He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.
Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.)
What was that?
Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.
(Smiling, like a salesman) All right. Now, what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today?
She's all right.
Green suit, power ring.
And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?
She doesnt wanna borrow the money.
I missed you.
George, Stacey.
(Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?
He's eighty!
See ya'.
What do you mean you don't think so?
What did he say?
What's the matter with you?
Well, good night [holds hand out and shakes hand]
Oh, The Muted Heart. Glen Close. Sally Field. Well, that should be good.
what?
What for?
You're like eight years old.
Sure.
That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without the cushy timeslot.
Are we finished?
Plus Im wearing short sleeves, I dont want to expose my tattoos. (Vanessa smiles; thinking) Shes unbelievable!
A robot butcher?
Beside that. Look at the waitresses.
How you doing?
What was that pop sound?
All of a sudden it hit me, I realized what the problem is; I can't be with someone like me.. I hate myself!! If anything I need to get the exact opposite of me....It's too much. It's too Much I can't take it ...I can't take it!!!
So they just gave you this?
Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour.
It was an accident.
Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected, outwardly.
(on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel! (hangs up the phone very disappointed)
(tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back) Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.
What?
George! Can we focus on the car, here?
Hey, have fun at the... family reunion. (George exits) So, what do you know about this Jack fellow?
No, George was there, he said he had a great time.
You see -- ah, uh ...
All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.
You said "you little phony"?
No, he didn't use 'man'.
This is really too much.
What are they for?
What do you mean?
Ah, mint.
Come on up.
C'mon..
Oh. That's not quite the same.
(on phone) Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil.
It's on the door.
It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.
No, I'm calling her.
Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?
Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestl's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--
Tony.
Who told you about Martin?
Whattya mean?
Let's put him over here.
To wash my hands. Theyre sticky from the orange.
Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.
Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something.
"Cut to the chase"?
Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and tear.
I dont bother with him. Hes been calling me for seven years. Ive never called him once! Hes got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if hes paying attention.
Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.
Jerry.
Almost. (Notices his shoes) Hey, new Timberlands?
Two minutes.
Why not?
My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?
First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.
Australia?
(Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?
I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.
We'll call him...
My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin' "where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?"
Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.
But...
Um, actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet. (takes the paper back)
I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!
Are you insane? Give 'em to me.
Isn't it Myanmar now?
Oh, I wouldnt quite say that.
(walking over the the buzzer to answer it) Oh, that's the Flicks.
Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!
Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives. (Picks up phone and dials) Hello Tim? Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you? Well it turns out I can use them. Oh, you do? I understand. Okay. Bye. He already made plans, he can't change them.
Quone? No, Im afraid that Im going to have to challenge that.
Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a little. .
Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't get any oxygen.
So it's all over?
Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?
What are you doing?
Did he overdose?
"Greatest Show on Earth"!
I said, never mind.
Aw, come on there now.
I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.
Come on! I know it's something you wanna do! (she pulls harder and he falls right off the table)
We gotta confess.
You touched 'em?!
Yeah, my grandma's missing.
Oh, can Lloyd really do that?
Were just not suited to be friends.
Great. One of the best jobs I ever had.
Yeah. Im having a wonderful time. (it's obvious he isn't)
(incredulous) I gave you a hundred dollars?!
So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show, I waited for you, you never came.
Hiya, Jack.
I can see that! What happened?
But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.
So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?
I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.
Oh! There coming to town tomorrow by the way.
Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.
That is so Franco.
That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?
(from the back of the club, leaving) That's it I'm calling in the big guns.
His lawyer.
Yeah, well, it won't be long.
Thanks.
Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this.
All right, just get out of here.
Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.
I didnt know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrants going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesnt make sense. Am I wrong?
Tuberculosis
Really?
Me.
What!?
No!
Yeah, that's part of it. (sniffs) Kasha?
She did?
No. Would you just get out?
I said yes, but I don't feel right about it. I mean I hardly know the guy. That's a big step oin a relationship. The biggest. That's like going all the way.
First we ride the cyclone.
If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened.
About 6-3.
Well, I don't think that's gonna happen.
Hey, Jeff. What's happening?
Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!
No.
Couple of interviews.
They're next to the poker chips.
Come on up.
Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something.
You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!
Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.
Gay?
What?
(Confirming) An alliance. (They both shake hands and laugh evily) Now get the hell outta here. (Newman leaves)
Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.
You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?
She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?
What if it gets in the side?
I didn't know any of this.
Yes, and I returned it in 1971.
Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer?
Hello?
No, what? What kind is it?
Does she know?
(noncommittal) Errh.
Yeah.
Oh, o.k. (Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.)
Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?
I bought him some kishka.
I did not bail out on you.
Hey
Hello... Oh hello Elaine.
Four hundred a month.
Its mostly water weight.
No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-
Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.
You know what that makes you?...A baldist.
Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?
I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.
Always popular.
That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?
All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? (sits opposite George)
No. No thanks.
The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.
You can be bleak in spring.
All right, very funny. I get it.
A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see 'em. Come on, I'm calling! (thumps hand on table) What d'you got!
No.
Two o clock.
...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.
(Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?
What're you gonna do?
I said, "and more."
She didn't stay over?
Come on let's eat something. (phone rings)
hey Kramer
Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didnt want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And its been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. (to Kramer) All right, so, just take what you want and lets get it out of here.
(Knocking on Kramer's door) Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey.
Did you find out who stabbed him?
Kramer, (Trying to pass him) get outta my way!
(to himself) Once a week? (to Uncle Leo) So how's Lydia?
Why what happened?
Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, "Make sure you hang on to your jacket."
If you feed him, he'll never leave.
Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery.
They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What do they look like."
Oh yeah, she's dating Bania.
20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.
(doing the voice) Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!
Where's the Mohel?
(sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there and I will.
Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?
He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught.
That's good.
That is one angry clown!
Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha.
I know it is!
(getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.
I still don't know what that means.
He asked you to watch them not wear them.
Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.]
My whole night's ruined. I didn't do any sets, didn't do any movies...
He wont take ya..
He's not that good.
You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding.
Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.
Aloe. So where's that lock smith?
'... downtown.'
(agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!
Yikes. Well, good look with all that.
Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail.
No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.
(reading) Jewish singles night?
I'm not kidding.
Hello?
I didnt open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.
Too dumb?
What if she's having an off night?
We have time.
No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?
You faked it? Why would you do that?
Musicians. Get a real job.
(To Katie) What is the complication?
Yeah.
What is that smell?
Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
No.
(looks at watch) Ten-thirty.
Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are?
I try.
What'd you do to your hair?
A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions) Ho, ho, ho.
some mouthwash, a hat, something.
I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night only, the big screen. My hands are tied!
no what?
Wow. That really is nothing.
Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.
You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.'
Westchester? Isn't that a private club?
Hi Roy.
Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.
Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.
I don't know, but you look like you're happy.
Thanks.
Hey, when Im driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. Im always waving everybody in. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. ...All right. All right. Ill have a chicken salad.
Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people?
I don't either.
Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..
Not you! The guy in the Amigo.
Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the etiquette?
She did, you insisted.
(After seeing how much his parents like her) Now, I'm not so sure.
(hitting metal with the first strike of the shovel) Well, that was easy.
Hello.
Oh, come on. Thats not true.
Well, that's where it gets tricky.
So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?
Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. Weve been doing this silly, dumb voice.
Hi.
Right.
What is that sound?
Okay.
(to Ramon) Oh. Okay. (to Elaine) Wh, what is he doing here?
Hey.
Golden Boys always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry. Here... touch Golden Boy!
Yes!!!
I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.
She's not really the naked type.
Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?
Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.
Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.
Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?
Well, after he bit my friend--
Im going out. (he comes out of the dressing room, while Kramer remains inside)
Did you give blood?
"I don't think so."
Well, you made me uncomfortable.
"Why are you taking this so personally?"
I don't...I dunno.
It's still bleak.
So, Im on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the...
I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!
You can't unclog it?
So what's going on with Simon? Did he leave?
All right.
Ahh, Im a 40. Why?
You chuck.
But he's an old man, Elaine.
Can't see on your right side?
Yeah.
(finding Frankie, in his hole) Frankie... come on out of there.
(Sympathetically) She coming of a bad break-up?
I got a haircut.
I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?
Yeah.
Yeah. Let's go.
I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!
Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand.
What is that?
No.
So what now?
Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?
Same as you cant overwet. You see, once something is wet, its wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die youre dead, right? Lets say you drop dead and I shoot you. Youre not gonna die again, youre already dead. You cant overdie, you cant overdry.
Yum yum little tuna fishy?
Yeah, this speed-dial's like a relationship barometer.
We won't ruin the friendship.
He say anything?
Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.
So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought.... And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me.
So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?
All right, just give me a western. (unhappy)
Hey, how was baby-sitting?
What are you doing? You're choking me. Elaine!
Hey.
Lets hear yours.
What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?
Hey, it happens.
She doesn't open...?
She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.
Please, don't make me beg.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?
I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.
(livid) Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one!
She got the promotion?
Yikes.
Audrey?
The car!
Um, you know, its the damnedest thing. It went away.
Who you gonna to call?
Well, the mans an individualist  he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what hes doing.
What is wrong?!
I thought you just said she doesn't know??
Stolen? When?
(Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.
Well what am I supposed to do now?
Dermatology?
(sits on the back of the couch) Oh my god.
Oh, nothing in particular.
(taps George's chest) Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six.'
You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?
You're going to do something about it?
All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?
(thinking to himself; picks up a tube) "Fungicide". Fungus?
(re the underwear pile) Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him.
Well, break a leg.
That puddle! (Kramer sees the puddle and does a double-take.)
Ok.
There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.
Yeah.
So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day?
There was no mistaking it?
You're not feeding him, are you?
Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made.
Oh! Is that the bald stuff?
Hey!
Is he gay?
How was your first day?
Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld.
(Stopping the notion) What's that?
Yeah, well that relationships really got a lot of potential.
So, ah, what are you doing around here Ramon?
No don't do this. You're not doing this. I will fight you. No you don't... No.
Well, it's something to consider.
Corvelay!
I'm Nelson!
(To George) Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?
So he just shaves his head for no reason?
And that guy is your new boss?
The blond with the blue sweatpants!
Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.
I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.
Come on! GEORGE is getting married!
Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!
Well, I painted my apartment again. Ive been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, its a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize its just the thickness of the paint, but Im aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, its closer and closer. I dont even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. Thats where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control... Thats why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching TV. Thats why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there.
What do you mean you're in the same class?
Wow
Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know, we can't go anywhere near there.
We? No.
O.k., good, I'll see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.)
Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.
I thought it sounded kind of cool.
Did you at least get him a card?
No.
Will you shut up George.
I dont care. Im sleeping next door.
Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.
No spiel?
Did I?
But it's your bodega.
So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George?
Where do they ever go on vacation?
I don't know.
There's more than a couple.
Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.
I just wanted to say how sorry I was...
There. Alright?
Tell me about it.
Oh, no thanks. (turns back to Kramer)
Kramer, look, it's George.
(knocking) Hey, Jenna. Hey!
So... did you stop by the dojo?
Yeah, I washed it.
Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome.
It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?
He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?
There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.
No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No.
It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?
Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand and put it on his shoulder)
All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier. (Elaine drinks straight out of the orange juice container) Hey.
What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?
Can I speak with this Bookman?
Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.
Where'd you get the bricks?
Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drakes coffee cake
I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
Come on up.
No, no, I mean...
Maybe he knows O'Brien?
...he never heard of corduroy!
We'll come to work with you.
They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys.
No I wasn't there. (enters and slams the door)
I got a 31 waist, mister!
That's great!
No kidding?
And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!
Ah, I'm so sorry.
So what do you write, childrens books?
(smiling) Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.
Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another mistake.
Yeah, I know.
I don't know what that could be.
Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.
How did you get fleas?
I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.
Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.
There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing *just* a bra. I can't get that image out of my mind.
All right. Elaine.
Hey buddy. I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's like in there, all night long things are creaking and cracking. And that red light is burning my brain!
(Continuing reading) "The Human Fund. Money for people."
That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.
Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway.
Yeah.
Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. (Newman considers the implications of this.)
No, I had to tell my friends  my friends didnt have to tell you.
Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is who's responsible for this?
(Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the 80s, and its still relatable today.
Really? (They start to make out, Jerry sees the pilot on the plane) Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!
You know how they do that?
I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!
Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?
You dont care?
The police?
Like you care.
(Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal.
I know isn't that something?
How about when Harrison Ford jumped out of that plane, and he was shooting back at them as he was falling?
Hey, T-bone!
Mine!
(Shaking his head no) Pff.
Hu, well, tomorrow, I, ...
Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment. How 'bout I make it up to you with dinner?
oh.. uh.. you know your breath is a little garlicky you better take some gum.
(testing Joel) So, Im thinking about going to Iran this summer.
Seems reasonable.
Now we have to buy a new couch?!
What do you mean she liked you?
Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. He's a punk, a patsy, a hack.
Shower?
Oh yeah right.
I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
(long pause -- did he hear "ridicurous" -- should he say something -- can't decide if he should. Finally...) Did you say, "ridicurous"?
Well if he's going then I'm not going.
George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?
The Inka-dink.. You were It.
Oh. Your ballet tickets.
Did you bring the keys?
No, I do not challenge.
Well, what about my car?
That'd be great. There's no wrong answer.
And a dead bolt.
I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.
Hey, do you know what the Whip does?
Oh, well, of course. Nineteen-seventy-three.
So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table
You could get arrested.
HUGE pop-in guy!
Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble...
Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.
(to Kramer) Could you stop that smacking?
What do you mean, oh boy?
...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either.
Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it is. (vehement) Just take it!
But there's no "t" in your name. What about G-bone?
How was it?
I know it was stupid.
Really? I thought you were rebuffed.
(Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here..
We won. Were in the finals on Wednesday.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
Doctor? Hes a podiatrist.
He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.
What happened to you?
Hello? Oh, hi Stu.
Okay, sixty bucks from Nana.
Yeah
(irritated) Great.
Would you?
"We're"? What do you mean, "We're"?
Oh, I'm gonna puke.
Thanks.
I'm not carrying a purse.
Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!
Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.
So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?
The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting out that marriage.
I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.
Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune.
What did you do?
Leroy
Miffed.
See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup...
Rabies.
Filthy pigs.
I know! What are you doin' here?!?
Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.
Well, what'd you say?
Hey. Could I use your shower?
402? (Checks his wristwatch) Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup!
What do you think?
So, we're givin' him nothing?
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.
I cant believe it! This guy ripped me off!
Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.
(leaving; singing) She'll be coming around the mountain...
I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life.
You think that's funny?
Oy ga-vault.
Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.
I'm not sending him to your house.
(Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say "Hi", and I say "Hello".
Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is.
Give me that wave!
The wedding is off? What happened?
Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)
Oh, hi Gennice.
What?
No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car.
Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not, a chicken.
(excited) Oh, Hi Beth
On many factors.
No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.
(hangs up the phone) Yeah, I really needed that suit.
I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
Hey. What happened to you yesterday?
What?
Hey! Wait up!
When is this suppose to be?
Well, I guess I have no choice.
Who couldn't.
Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?
I'm heading over to Elaine's.
Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men
Oh, no...
What is going on out there?
Course not.
In your way.
I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.
I don't think that's Salman.
Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.
Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone? You wanted the machine. You know, and you're always kind of thrown off, (left hand up to side of face, pretending its a receiver) you go "Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you."
Raymond?
Elaine.
Why did he fire her?
Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's leftovers.
What about a plastic bag?
You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.
I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.
(he hits a few keys and looks over at her) Cash advance... yes (hits a key)  no (he looks over again) balance inquiry... no (he looks again) receipt.... no (he looks again) processing... processing... (He opens the box, pulls out his money and then looks at the woman and says) I won!
Ok.
Yeah, got it from the bank.
Jane's topless. (They all look)
Dont do the apples. Its enough already with the apples.
You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't destroy someone else's.
Oh, why?
Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, George Louis Costanza. Here I am about to go to the electric chair and my oldest friend is dating the governor
A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.
I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, its very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, Call the police. You really should call the police. So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, Yeah, Im calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... Im gonna see some real action. Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out The Report. They give you Your Copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I dont really think were gonna crack this case, do you? Its not like Batman, where theres three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up, hes dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him, hes a PENGUIN!
Oh.
He's been sleeping a lot. He's still groggy.
This was your idea!
Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank.
Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met!
Well, we need change and all I have is twenties.
Well I?m looking forward to meeting him.
All right, make it the large sodas.
I have an idea. (Elaine enters; to Elaine) We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three.
George, the phone's free.
Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.
They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
(Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah?
Well you have to.
Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.
Adoring? What about handsome?
What are you doing?
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.
Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?
Good luck, It's sold out for the next three weeks.
Should I shake his hand?
Well, at least have some reaction to it.
Relax. Who are they?
(glances at it) Pretty good.
So you're not gonna come back to New York with us?
Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?
Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll never get another date with her. She'll freak out.
You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?
They were all like that!
(derisively at Kramer) Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?
You need an exterminator?
Huh?
Doofus?
We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.
Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying "mickey"!
Yes I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition...
But you took a nap in it.
So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was just wondering if there were houses there to rent.
Double zero?
And who were you tryin to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?
Hi Elaine.
No, no, no. I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.
How can you talk to someone like that?
All right! I'll do it. The race is on.
Yeah, sounds like fun.
Oh, that'll intrigue him.
Alright, I'm gonna get this. This looks good.
It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse "ha's." You know those?
I'm gonna call her.
(closing the door on him) Oh!
It was a so-so sorry.
Gwen?
See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey George, look, I'm not funny now.
Fine all done, just looking for the soap.
Hi, Alec.
This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!
Yes I know that.
Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.
Hm.
(stopping them) We better not. (they make out some more; then stop) T-They're gonna be here any second.
Hot tub?
Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it.
Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?
There's a g-spot.
Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.
It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes the door) Give me that back.
Seinfeld.
Uh huh.
What should I do, should I call the police?
Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.
I thought you were leaning towards Julie.
But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.
I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?
People dont turn down money. Its what separates us from the animals.
So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on me.
See, its never as bad as you imagine.
I could tell you what I did, but you wouldnt believe it. Its not believable.
(thinking) Thank you, Pamela! (turns to talk to Vanessa; to Vanessa) So, youre a lawyer...
W-w-wha' you got in there?
(Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled "Ori-dent") Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!
George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!
I like the button fly.
Bye!
(bored) Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it.
Ahh.
We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.
Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.
Why should I have anything for say for myself?
(to Kramer) You left the door open?!
(To himself) Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. (George doesn't react) What's the matter?
Friend!
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.
No you go on ahead, I'll take the bus.
You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-
But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.
(pause) Oh. Big deal..
It's alright, I want you to have it.
Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.
(Surprised to see her, he gets up) Where's George?
Oh there's nothing to see.
That's the way they do it in Vegas.
Bon voyage, Lainey!
Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.
But it was in the cylinder!
Ah...catalog writer's block?
Maybe he didn't know?
It's hard to say.
Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?
Yeah, well, I didnt- Is that something you want to borrow?
(Shrugs) I - I don't get it.
(to George) You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.
(backs his story) Hmm, hmm.
Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.
Why don't you get a new sofa?
(ranting) I can't believe how a little thing like George going too fast - and my whole weekend is gone - the plans, the packing, ... everything.
Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? Wha, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just sit there going, "Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh, no, another headcase!"
Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.
(in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.
Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?
Nah, we've seen it.
What're you gonna do down there?
That's what I thought.
Hey.
Where you going?
It was a mistake.
More sheets per roll
She must be psychotic or something.
Ten minutes.
Yeah.
Little buffer zone.
Oh, she worked at Doubleday...?
Yeah. Eighteen strangles.
No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.
Its very good.
[rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your point!
Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.
You know my friend Bob Sacamano?
She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?
You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!
(to George) Is that uh, other apartment still available?
I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer?
Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?
Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?
Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.
Although what if its one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?
Why, what's up?
Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.
What is it she think you can't do?
Nice Mohel picking, Elaine. You picked a helluva Mohel!
(impatiently cutting in) Hey Elaine What about the crest.? What d'you think of the crest here.
Uh, no. Should I have?
Hey!
Is it...? Could it...? Could he have...? IT IS! (Grabs Kramer.) Poppie peed on my sofa!!
Couldn't be...
Hey.
Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I'm sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.
I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.
I suppose you think your bombable.
What?
(taking the menus) Oh, thanks.
Oh, its just this stupid thing.
What?
These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you?
I need a miracle.
Women need to like the job of the guy theyre with. If they dont like the job, they dont like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. Well, right now, Im the regional management supervisor. Im in development, research, consulting... Men on the other hand  if they are physically attracted to a woman  are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men dont really care. Menll just go, Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? Youre just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why dont you shower up, and well get some burgers and catch a movie.
Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio.
Fifty dollars?
She looked great.
Aaaahhh...!!!
Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.
Well, so it wasn't a total loss.
You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!
See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.
(pause. Stops tapping his leg) 'scuse me?
I don't know.
(confused) Dinner? W..What time is it?
Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.
I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.
(Leaving) Right back at ya, Slick.
What is that?
Bug guy.
You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.
Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?
(Bravely) Well, what if I deliver it?
Well, I take it very seriously.
Saturday night (she leaves)
You mean *a* career.
Hey, did I make it?
Yeah.
what?
And who is on the show? Who are the characters?
Uh-huh...
I did not!
Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!
I don't know. I just feel he should call me.
Hi
It is kind of silly.
"I don't think so. I think they were getting dressed and not only that; my shirt was out!!!"
That'd be the fleas.
Yes I know, I know.
(smiling) Yeah
To the door?
What are you talking about?
The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)
Did you steal my car?
What's your airport route?
Well...actually, we kind of broke up.
If you'll excuse me.
(Thinking he's stopped Leo's thefts) Thank you.
If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?
Why?
He'll be here any second.
Oh, is this a bit?
Come on.
No, No, No, No, Oh, No.
I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.
It's not one of those 976 calls, is it?
Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy.
If only the coin hadnt hit the table.
No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.
So what'd we get?
That bothered you?
What's wrong with yours?
Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.
Woah. (hitting George)
How long do they usually last?
Ah hah, alright, let's go.
The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?
Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.
You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.
Why'd you sell your pants to Bania?
So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?
Hi.
(to Kramer) To the right.
osh.
Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!
Yeah, I blamed it on you. Hi Tim.
Oh, Phil... Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry.
Cops eating Milanos. What crazy town is this?
Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.
Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift. I know, it's a label maker. The Label Baby Junior. Yeah, I hear they're good. Well, label me thankful. Okay, well you enjoy those tickets. Buh-bye.
This woman's completely ignoring me.
You didn't ... (makes motion like he's lighting a cigar)
oh, I d-I don't know. I d---
Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.
Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way.
(jocular) Eighteen-fifties?
Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..
Oh, you're crazy.
Bagels?
Good evening, Rabbi.
Oh, no.
(looking at Kramer's moustache) Uh, we're not doing that anymore.
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.
Are you nuts? You dont even know the guy.
(tearing through his laundry bag) Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on, let's go.
That's right, the Bubble Boy.
No. No. I don't mind at all.
I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something.
What's the matter?
... I think. Have some more wine. (Jerry pours his whole glass of wine into her glass.)
I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around..
Uh huh. When youre on a stakeout, do you find its better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?
Why not?
Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa.
I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give!
Its a bet.
All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...
Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so fuck(bleeped)ing good.
(Confused) Where'd you get that one?
Yeah.
You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.
Do you want me to break up with you?
Oh, yeah, you mentioned her.
You're racing!
How come? I told you - It's fantastic.
No, he's still stuck at the foundation.
I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.
Hot dog?
So, you would date a married guy? That's so hacky.
No, it's-
I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? "You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know "No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back."
Prognosis Negative.
Oh yeah I like this idea.
We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.
Uh, well. It, uh...
How's it going?
Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated.
Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice?
(Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.
The coffeeshop?
Sorry, I don't have any cash.
(Patting his head I'm a comedian.
What happened?
Hey.
Make sure you get this area here, where he needs the help....
Absolutely.
(to George) Again with the sweat pants?
Hey, look at the high score--"G.L.C." George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?
But is this an emergency?
Is that what the doctor said?
I would like to know what my names doin in this creep's organizer to begin with.
This is George, this is Kramer.
I was arrested for urinating.
Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested)
I didn't actually want to rent it.
You are. I can't get that thing in my car. (referring to George)
Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.
The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. Cause it says Waiting Room. Theres no chance of not waiting. Cause they call it the waiting room, theyre gonna use it. Theyve got it. Its all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and youve got your little magazine. You pretend youre reading it, but youre really looking at the other people. You know, youre thinking about about them. Things like, I wonder what hes got. As soon as she goes, Im getting her magazine. And then, they finally call you and its a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. Well, I guess Ive been chosen. Ill see you all later. You know, so you think youre going to see the doctor, but youre not, are you? No. Youre going into the next waiting room  the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You dont wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You dont want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in? Do they scalp tickets to these things? I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two...
Yeah.
Well what do girls do ?
Famous Original Ray's?
Ya broke my blender, didnt ya?
Thanks, great party.
Oh, all the way.
Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.
Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.
You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.
Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.
U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you?
Thank you. Hi Cynthia.
Hey.
Kramer, are you drinking that milk?
Fifty dollars. I Don't Believe This!
This is the man you have a crush on?
So they're like everyone else.
Hey.
(Nodding) I think you may have something there.
No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.
Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.
Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
Look, I'm sorry-
Why?
Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?
oh you're afraid he might look like Zippy the pinhead
How 'bout if it was something like " I can't find my receipt my place's a stye.
Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher.
(through gritted teeth) Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.
No.
(to George) You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! It's crazy Joe Devola.
Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.
Uh?
I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.
Were going. Thats next Wednesday.
Swimming?
The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?
(quickly moves over toward Matthew) What the *beep*(fuck) are you doing? You little piece of *beep*(shit)!
That's my ticket!
Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.
We have an appointment!
But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.
(suspicious) Really?
All right take it easy, just take it easy.
Hey, hey. uh Pamelas birthday party, didnt I see you there? Jerry.
Sure. Bye.
(Frustrated, he reacts) Everybodys ripping me off!
No...
That's what it costs!
He could have said "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.
Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.
H... G... F. Seat four. One, two, three... f-- Hello Newman.
As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protg of my own.
C'mon, you want to have a baby.
I think if ones going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. Its common courtesy. I dont know. Thats just the way I was brought up.
(To George) What's the matter?
Naturally.
I can't go until I find my cufflinks.
Oh God!
"Sometimes I tuck'em sometimes I don't"
So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouth-to-mouth.
(to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)
(to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)
"I don't know how you can eat that spicy chicken,"
OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers?
Who would order a license plate that says "Assman"?
is that so?
Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?
Defent.
Were still friends.
You mugged Stephen Hawking?
(joyless) Yeah, yes.
I'm telling you, she's good looking.
All I said was "I like the pen".
I don't want to.
Hey!
(NO!)
What is it?
Well I do.
Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?
A phony? He called me a phony?
He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV.
I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.
I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.
What'd ya get?
Im getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other line beeps) Im getting another call, see ya(answers call) Hello!
I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club.
He let you?
Excuse me.( gets up and opens the door)
Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.
So put 'em in a safe place.
Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.
Come on up. (to parents) It's George.
Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine?
(astonished) Oh god! What happened to you?!
No, its not that. It wasnt all one-sided.
Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe well get together.
Then it was trash.
How ya doing? (George nods) Can't talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his brace) Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his eyebrows) I like that. (George sticks his tongue out) So how's life without tonsils? (George quickly indicates with his arm that he wants ice cream) What? What's that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?.. (George signals that it's more) Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy.. (George motions for ice cream again) What are you doing?
Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.
Oh! (hitting George)
Hi.
Where's Kramer?
Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.)
Thank you.
Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. (holds his nose up like a pig) You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.
Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.
(Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.
Ma, you cant look up words in the dictionary! (to Morty) Dad, shes cheating!
What if it's Neil Diamond?
No in a matter of fact it isn't.
What could possess anyone to throw a party? I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.
(under his breath) George.
Already? That was fast... I assume he's not a High Talker...
(to the phone) George, whats going on?!
"Oh! where's Jennifer today?"
Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.
Excuse me, Mother?
(quietly) I told you to cut it out.
So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm gonna try to sell the van to a lot.
That's right. I bought it.
C'mon, that's not fair!
Ill call Kramer. He can check my house.
Bania?
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.
Best friend- Ive never been to your apartment.
Kramer?
I'm looking forward to it.
You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.
(to the phone) Hello?
That's it?
Yeah.
Well, she's... like you.
(scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.
Yeah.
Yeah. Good seeing you again Karen.
Is it a lot of cream soups?
To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.
I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You know (does the motion for the check) Check, Check. Unless the waiter isn't too shape then you gotta total it up. Sometimes they come over, "Do you want the check?" No I wanna be pen pals, can't you see what I'm doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people.
Oh, I got the machine.
Cmon, cmon, go ahead, move up.
What's stopping them?
But I don't want any "sweet action."
Ah.
Oh, the "triangle" guy.
Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.
So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new guy, in a big pot of love stew.
All right. Take it back.
Hi Doris.
I wonder.
Is the flounder here yet?
That's from the car!
So you go in the bathroom at eleven your in bed by what, two?
Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.
Sexual?
I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didnt want to talk to, I could go, Excuse me, Im not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away. I also have a cordless phone, but I dont like that as much, because you cant slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone  You cant talk to me like that! Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone  You cant talk to me like that!
Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.)
You're not Valerie.
No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture.
NO! Kramer!
(taking the envelope) Wh..What's this?
Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.
Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here.
How could you say that?
No, she looks completely normal.
Yes, I know, I know.
Well, technically he did apologize.
The female orgasm is kinda like the bat cave, very few people know where it is and if you're lucky enough to see it you probably don't know how you got there and you can't find your way back after you left. There are two types of female orgasms, the real and the fake. And uh I'll tell you right now, as a man, we don't know. We do not know, because to a man sex is like a car accident and determining the female orgasm is like being asked 'What did you see after the car went out of control?'. 'Uh I heard a lot of screeching sounds, uh I remember I was facing the wrong way at one point. And in the end my body was thrown clear.'
Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.
And that waist cincher, that was the topper!
She does have a way.
Your butler?
So you put down my money?!
Alright.. (Takes his coat off)
But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.
No, that's the rule. It's optional.
I dunno , I'm gonna ask Shelley ,but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident.
Ahh, too bad you got a little, George Costanza thing going on.
Im a little nervous.
"Glamour"?
Hello, *Newman*...
He's going' out with you on Friday?
Restaurants too?
What happened to you?
You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married.
What about skunk?
Yeah.
Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.
I was out.
You know, you're little hair hat there.
Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye.
(still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)
(standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. (indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.
No, why should I? I wear boxers.
All right.
My door?
No, but the difference is negligible.
Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.
Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat)
What?
(pause, to Donna) You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name...
So your saying UNICEF is a scam?
They sealed him up with the mint inside.
We were right on the border.
Pamela? Do I know her?
Tony, hey hey (continues fooling)
So, did you two, uh,  have uh,
(reading note) Oh my god!
Crazy Joe Divola
Oh, like you do.
Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.
All right.
Yeah.
All right were coming down.
Is that my towel?
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.
I don't want to trade.
(opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?
Okay..
He said that?
Get out of here!
(pointing at Georges shirt) See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. Its too high! Its in no-mans-land. You look like you live with your mother.
Hmm. That looks new.
I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.
I don't read in the bathroom.
Oh, it's nothing...
Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises?
Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.
It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.
No, for both!
I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.
What about Elaine?
Why?
I don't have your suit. I gave it away.
I can't do this.
(Out of it) Huh?
(nods) Look, postcard from Elaine from Europe.
Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought.
"Lose that"? That's not a Hollywood expression!
Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.
I heard you say something, there.
(pointing to Elaine) Her father wrote that.
You should always carry a pad and pen.
Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?
(Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! A dinosaur!
Look, she's cutting up an Almond Joy.
Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here. (pointing up and down at George)
W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?
Good question.
A friend of a friend of Susan's.
"Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!"
Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?
Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.
(going through couch cushions) Where the hell did I put this?
What are you doing? Were going out for dinner in ten minutes.
You know, I don't even know my IQ.
Yes, I will.
Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents.
Well what about me! If you're going like that, I?m not going like this.
You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?
Yeah, over here.
I don't care.
I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes.
Again?
There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that...
Dinner?
(coughing) I said, boy am I ugly.
I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?
Yeah.
Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?
Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?
Okay.. (Opens the door to a frantic Elaine)
No, but wait, wait And then you dump them off onto Kramer..
Do you ever win at poker?
It's not complicated.
How could I have done that?
Fred, do you know Elaine?
He *had* cancer!
Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.
Oh yeah? What'd he have to say?
Oh that makes a lot of sense.
Ohhhh...
She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!
Who said you have to like it?
When did you get tickets to see that?
Are you ready?
Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--
Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.
What for?
Come on. Come on.
You what?
Yes you do.
Fourteen years down the drain. (points and walks off -- to the bathroom)
Nah, it's not for me.
Good, good.
It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---
Gee, I never thought of that.
Bad rap?
George
(Introducing the two) George, this is Nina.
Well, just get it down.
Oh, no, not Frankie.
Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. (Faint) I don't care about that.
There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?
Come in.
Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.
(thinking) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft... (to Vanessa) Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit.
Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?
If you can.
Talk to me.
What are you doing? Were going out to dinner in ten minutes.
It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.
So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth? (Elaine laughs silently)
Good luck.
Shes right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, Im gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.
No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'
Ate? What? What the hell are you talking about? Now you listen to me, you get out of that apartment this instant. If you screw this up for me I swear....
Yes, it can.
(tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggage, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangements, but we can't seem to be friends when we sleep together.
Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats right behind the glass?
(extemporising) That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go.
Ok, I'll see you around the building.
...You bite it, you bought it.
Hello there, how're you doing?
I'm not lying.
Mulva.
(also wearing a moustache) What do you mean, 'what is it?' It's a country right next to Belgium.
Uh, I don't know, we used to go out.
Maybe I should ask her out?
Did I get a head start?
It's a lotta gum!
I can't wear these!
No, thank you.
That?
Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.
I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?
Of course, I stink, you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks..
Just go back and ask him again. (Slams the door on Kramer)
(to Elaine) And where were you?
Is that a fact?
Why are you doing this?
Nothin'.....nothing at all.
Kramer.
Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You cant do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.
Why would I freak out? (To himself) Pilot...
You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.
That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little off.
Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?
I'm off the project. (He exits)
Kramer, what the hell did you do?
And milk.
Hi
Sure.
To my beautiful wife.
Hi Sue Ellen.
What?
How many years of med school did you have?
Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down. It's a business.
Cindy.
Since college.
I like to use my own material.
You stink worse than I do!
Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?
What's wrong with your oven?
What?
What for?
Hello Newman.
Does that thing work?
Oh, I'll split a cab with you.
C'mon up. (To George) Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'
(Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat.
There must be some mistake.
Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?
I, uh...well...
Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.
Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.
Good body, nice body.
Oh, man!
Yeah, you in?
Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?
I'm callin' Elaine. See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley.
Oh, right... But you *hated* it!
Not.
(Joking around) Hey, didn't I beat you up in the fourth grade?
Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didnt like the looks of the defense and changed the play.
No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.
Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...
All right, forget it, forget it. Im not taking the place!
(Thinks) What does she say...?
Come on. Let's go.
Now, how could that be good?
Hi Elaine.
Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.
How about this I manage a circus..
George, who is that woman in the stripes?
I think I may have made a big mistake.
Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?
Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.
What?
No appointments at all? (motions to Elaine to move over)
What?
Dead?
Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.
I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I dont get this. Arent cows outside most of the time? I dont understand it. When its raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, Let us in, were all wearin leather. Open the door! Were gonna ruin the whole outfit here! Is it suede? I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I cant have this cleaned. Its all I got!
There you go.
You see?
(confused) We're talking about people, right?
Really very nice and good.
Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?
You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.
No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.
Yeah.
Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him)
Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.
Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist.
She's makin' the three o'clock train.
You're marchin' in.
Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.
I cant blame you. I cant believe she never called you back.
I don't like pesto.
I know the list...
No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?
Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'
Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing "no") A little taste! (still shaking) Come on. (still shaking)
Oh my god, it's Bania and Jenna.
What?
Why?
You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?
Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.
Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
Who is that woman?!
So are you...
I didnt even think to look.
I didn't hear anything.
OK.
Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?
(To George, in a 'cha-ching!' motion) Vermont! (To Ellen) With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to! (George is disturbed. He gets up, goes go Kramer's door, and knocks. They talk) Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I can't wait.. buy-bye. (Hangs up. George and Kramer come into Jerry's apartment, confronting him) What? (George takes the phone off the hook) What is this?
(to Kramer) So how's your karate class going?
Hey.
The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves)
How's it look?
He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.
Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.
So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?
Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?
Leo's furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at George's book) What is that doing on the table?
Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay.
Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend.
Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.
What if I didn't do it right?
Elaine ... look! A twenty!
Can you believe that?
Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?
We're doing sixty miles an hour!
...So how's Noreen?
Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!
No. This is why you're not in the pilot.
Still got it.
Thats not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table repeatedly.) You know, maybe its not that bad an idea.
What?
(to self) Oh. Twist off..
No, I do not like the bank. Ive heard the expression Laughing all the way to the bank. I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when theres nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, its empty and you still have to go through the little maze. (walking on the stage like he is going through a maze) Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? Im almost at the front. Id like a reward for this please.
I think that's a little extreme.
Oh, so there's still hope.
(stands, puzzled, it's not sinking in) W-what do you mean?
Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?
(grimaces and takes the shovel back) I'll dig.
(Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) It'll be on your conscience.
She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.
Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)
But then anyone can just look in and see you.
How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable special . I 've never gotten a cable special.....well that's it I'm not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado. (to the silent Kramer on the couch beside him) ...Exactly.
I don't know.
Kramer!
Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.
Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door)
Kramer wants to die with dignity.
Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.
Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, that's it. They go to the next show.
Oh, he's coming.
Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I cant ask her.
Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.
He was shouldering.
All right, all right.
You are.
He did it.
Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.
My god, are you okay?
Who's gonna be O'Brien?
You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial.
(sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.
But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.
We'll pull up another chair.
If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.
Of course. It's garbage.
No, we don't care, we just want to go.
Maybe it's in the lost and found.
Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?
Not goin' to the Knick game.
Kramer's guys?
They deliver the coal?
(determined) I wanna join. I need it to become a member.
What happened here, Kramer?
(looking at the Wizard) Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents.
(annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? Besides it's not a submarine and there's no room for a periscope in a car.
And it's about nothing?
Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.
He drove a car with no arms?
You promise you'll never come in here again?
(turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isn't that your charter group?
Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?
He's a ringer!
Oh yeah.
What are you two doin' here?
Well we
(calmly getting up with plate of chicken) Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, (drops chicken into sink) was, for two.
I mean, she called me. I havent called her. She started it.
Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.
Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad.
Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner
Saving movies.
All right.
Do you have to write all this stuff down.
So?
Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it.
Yeah right.
(Still skeptical) No, he doesn't.
Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.
Hey! What is wrong with you?!
She's too good.
My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didnt want to move to Florida, but theyre in their sixties, and thats the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old peoples house with a golf cart, jump out, Lets go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. Drop it! I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversations so boring. Its so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, What if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass. You know. Come back in, theres broken glass, everybodys all upset. No, Im all right. I was just a little bored there. And uh no, Im fine. I came back. I wanted to hear a little more about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Lets pick it up right there.
I got no problem with that.
Hey! Just like you pretend to be.
Today's not my birthday.
Nice looking Lugar.
I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?
Hi Sarge.
She wouldn't so much as taste it.
What's that?
I was just in the bathroom.
Believe me I didn't see anything.
What is that music?
Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet.
Nah...
The Portuguese waitress?
Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!
1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass!
How can he not know that?
Ah
Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.
Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.
Newman! She went out with Newman!
Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore...
I don't know.
Ow. Stupid fold-out! Why'd they put the bar in the middle of the bed?
What's the matter?
Yes!
I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there.
That is disgusting.
Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?
Oh?
(Gets up) Get out!
Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.
What?
Whats with the pink lining and the candy stripes?
(Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.
You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe its Manage A Trois.
I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.
No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.
Out.
You'll sense it.
44th and 9th.
I got one problem. Youre keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that shes coming.
Oh yeah, I heard all about it.
Not today, pal.
Come on up.
I know.
That's a date?
All right, sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) George?
He doesn't wanna take a ride.
Will you let me pay just once.
Oh... all right... wanna get some pizza?
(Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script?
Yeah.
Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?
(stares at George, incredulous) "Back on"? What was it doing off?
Sue Ellen Mishke?
What's this?
Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.
She's as good as anybody else.
Not (with) that, no..
How do you know?
Hey, Kramer...?
Hello
(opening the door) Well, it was nice meeting you.
We found out his super power was lack of money.
So, are you going to leave?
Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?
Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.
This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!
Farfel?
Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off that sign?
Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?
Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?
Well, break a leg tonight.
I guess we'll never know.
Boy, some cast, huh? Pavarotti, Aver Martone.
I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!
But I changed my mind..
Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?
So you don't think it's attractive?
How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go.
how's you get her to meet here?
Technically, you're sauted. So, what are you doing for that?
Ahh!!! They're out!
Newman!
Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?
So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.
I don't know. What if I get caught?
But, I never...
Told you.
Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room, searching for the TV.) ELAINE!
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, whats going on?
How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?
No, you don't have to buy anything.
Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. (George laughs) So, when do you move into the apartment?
Aye, aye.
Women go bald?
You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. And you can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. Then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin' Alright, gimme everything you have, too''.
Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful.
Well I think that's pretty obvious.
Well, yeah...sure.
I want the massage!
Well we saw you come in.
(cont) and this whole justice league, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman. You mean to tell me Superman can't cover everything?
so the woman was walking around in a bra
Everything.
All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.
Well turn the light on...
He'll dispose of it.
Seth! Wow what has it been like five years?
Hi. Elaine, it's me.
Anyway, I don't need your help. (Turns to leave.)
Never mind.
Here you go. (Poppie stands up and takes the money.) Anyway, I'm sorry again about the...(notices a large, wet stain on his couch)...the...the...
Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.
You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?
Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.
Yeah. Me.
Sounded good.
Have you thought any more about that trip?
The dog? The dog??
Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,
It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
You're wearing the chocolate shirt!
Me either.
(on the phone) Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.
Like a frightened turtle!
Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
I thought your mother's paying for it.
Hi.
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?
Oh like you do.
Then can I have it back?
And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
I sense something is afoot.
I was ready to get jiggy with it.
You dont know Robert Schumann? The composer?
Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before.
Listen, George, little problem with the game.
Try me.
Yeah.
She might be. She's the star of the show.
I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.
No, its okay now, that, that girl is not comin. Uh, I misread the whole thing.
All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.
You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it)
I just thought ahh maybe I could talk to Roy, if um
Wow. What are we celebrating?
No, I don't.
Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?
Know *what*?
Yes.
And you are?
I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.
Not yet.
So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more "grease monkey".
Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it.
You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.
(picks up the phone on the coffee table) 555-3455. Well wait a second, don't you see that's 555-FILK.
It was embarrassing to me.
Because I gave it to you.
Anywhere in the city?
Hey, Kramer, look at this.
My jacket?
Is this about me?
Ehh, nobody listens.
There's no Zorn or Zoutraph.
I've never had a job.
He took out Kruger?
(Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.
Hey, you look awful.
I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.
Hi.
Sorry!
The big toe; The captain.
If I like their race, how can that be racist?... Hellooo??... Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!... Yyy-yes, I am calling George... Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!
Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?
Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
That's right.
(Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So we're on for later?
Ill have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.
No, I actually find you quite charming. A bit verbose at times...
Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...
What?
There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair, striped shirt?
I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. (Miss Rhode Island laughs.)
"That's the guy?"
Excuse me?
So you think it's a non-vite?
What?
Yeah. Yeah.
(Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?
They're the worst.
He's a boy who lives in a bubble.
I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
So, coffee shop?
Yeah.
Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually do it)
So you like her?
Have we even been in public?
I told you to take it.
You do the tub?
Understand you had a little talk with him too.
Not with a cane?
Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give it back to me.
(To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.
What if we get caught?
Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship.
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
I don't think I am.
You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.
You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.
From what?
What about?
Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.
I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.
Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
What?
...C'mon.
Youre welcome.
No.
I don't know. 25 bucks a day.
All right Thanks. Come on lets go
(Puts his hand over his mouth) What?
Well ... ok, I guess (voice trailing off)
No, never.
(after a very awkward pause, cheerily) Hey, neighbor.
No kidding?
I think theres a mental hospital near here.
I never shoulda told you.
So you bought a cooler?
Hi. Hi. Look, I don't know what you think --
George...
(nodding awkwardly for a moment) All right, I think we're done here. (Jerry leaves and Phil shuts the door darkly)
'Cause that's what's gonna happen.
(pause) I don't know, they just tell you the night before.
Id really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.
Valerie's not coming over, is she?
Ah ha...
I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.
Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it?
All right we'll wait for you.
Oh, George Costanza , Kennedy High.
So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the Spokes model category?
Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?
She likes him I mean she really likes him.
(smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good.
You put that in!
O.K., soon as Elaine gets here.
I gave you a taste. What do you want?
What is that anyway?
So who's the new you?
What happened?
Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out?
Right.
She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing.
You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.
Yeah.,
Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for membership.
Uhh... no.
I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?
I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.
(thinking) So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?
Clean as a whistle.
(To himself) Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over there? It's not like somebody died. It's "Beaches" for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't.
Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.
(Making nothing of it) So? Who cares about that?
Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
I did.
(defensive) At least it was just the handle!
He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. (Mimics brushing his teeth) Away from the gums... (The door opens a little, George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and Elaine, then enters.)
Well I can see it.
Why are you buttering your face?
hmm. (nodding head)
Yeah, yeah I did.
No, its not you. Its your stomach, hes taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
What would you say if I told you that...
Hey. Hey, Mickey. What's going on?
Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)
No, I believe he can.
Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in big, big trouble.
(Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) I didn't say anything.
Wow.
Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.
Well...
Oh, hello...
You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.
It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.
So I guess I'll s--
It is unbelievable.
Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?
Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school.
Ok, I'll see ya.
But I could do that and the music.
George.
Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just -
Where did I take it? Where Did I Take It? (stabbing a knife into a cutting board) Umm, to that place on, uh Columbus and 85th. Okay?
She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.
That's an open-lip kiss, alright.
Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.
He can have a donut,
(answering machine) Leave a message. I'll call you back. Thanks.
This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
You are soo good lookin'.
As a mater of fact, he did.
Are you gonna say it again?
Are you sure?
She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
That's a good one. Dentists.
Hellooo Newman.
That's because you didn't win.
What's that?
What are doing, you crying??
What's going on?
Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?
Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour, then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night.
It was just a couple of blocks.
Babu, you're Pakistani, right?
Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.
Hey, Elaine. Did you get my message?
Why?
Yeah.
You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!
Sure you can. Why not?
No he's going downtown to guard the suit.
Oh, hi.
Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!
No, no, no ugly side.
Oh, hi dad.
I bought you a Cadillac. (hands over the keys) Here you go.
So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy.
I don't know him. I know who he is.
Yeah, what happened?
How do you feel?
Hey Kenny. (with some fake enthusiasm, just to be polite)
You're right he's insane.
There's really nothing wrong on the inside.
Alright, soldier boys, let's fall out.
Oh, go ahead.
You loaned her Pitt's racquet?
Hey, why don't cha ask Susan?
Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom.
What about you?
George-
Oh friendship... friendship, shmanship .
Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?
How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it.
who do you think she is? how dare she? you want me to get the manager? too bad they don't have those old ladies walking around with flashlights anymore we'd flush her out
Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything.
What?
Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.
"Yeah!"
C'mon Elaine, it's just a goiter...
It's Patty.
Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--
Maybe you won't like it.
Ah, I'm one kind.
You don't have to, really.
What's going on in there?
They serve soup at 6 a.m.?
I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.
I did something stupid.
Thanks, Julio.
Carl, I think.
I can't go.
I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. "The New Yorker is stealing my ideas." ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real.
I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?
This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-
Kramer?!
Oh, the guy from Jersey?
You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.
Women aren't like us.
They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
Really.
(walking out) Thanks for having me over, guys.
No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.
You got a date with Becky Gelke?!
Hm, really?
I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand.
I dont really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because theres that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, youre sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, Im really sorry about this. I dont know why I left that stuff over there. And thats why I could never be a maid, because Id have an attitude. Id find them, wherever they are in the house, Oh, I suppose you couldnt do this? No, dont get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldnt dust. No, this is too tough, isnt it?
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!
182 bucks.
Lean your head back. Open your mouth! (Grabs Kramer's head) Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!
No steam!
Maybe I am.
Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?
Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.
So, Puddy, I decided Im gonna go with another 900 convertible.
Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.
Tony, y-you better bring that car back!
Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?
What kind of plans?
What the hell is this?
Its just unbelievable.
she's one of these people, always have to be different
I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.
Yeah, we'll see ya.
Well I don't know if I ...
Just relax, you'll be fine.
(answering) Hello?
Will you stop it.
..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.
I know, but...
Fleckman?
I can't.
That's nice.
Uh-huh.
How about 'Mickey'?
What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him? 'Cos I asked him about the Knicks?
Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.
Do you even know what this scene is about?
Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
"I don't think I'm hungry"
It's just...
I don't know.
Gimme that thing!
Everything?
The pop-in.
What's with you?
So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?
Ya, 1397.
You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
I didn't think so.
What stuff?
40.
Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.
(deadpan) That must be some book.
Hey!
See ya.
What do you mean? They know we're here.
Yeah.
Oh, beautiful did he like them?
What?
wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to just sense it's in front of the couch?
Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. (standing) I'm going to the bathroom.
Right, you were leaving.
So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.
Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money.
You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it.
Absolutely not. He sped up.
Well, what is he, a vampire?
Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.
I don't know!
That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!
Are you serious, what about Elaine?
We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men.
Definitely.
What? What?
You better finish your little caf latte there. They won't let you in with it.
(pushes George) NOT THAT YOU IDIOT!!
(calls) Hey you two. Im ready to go.
(to Kramer) who is it?
Well I started to go under...
My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.
There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her
Yeah?
Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second. Hello.
(to George) Keep going.
No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!
Its raining? Its raining. The game will be postponed. Well play tomorrow.
I think you scared me straight.
It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.
Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.
Lord of the manor.
What are we doing out here? Aren't we going to go in and eat?
(Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.
Mmmmmmmm!
(Gestures to his forehead) Youre getting that vein again.
Oooh.
That's incredible!
What time is the lesbian wedding?
Yeah, there's a new one in there.
You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the "Astonishing Tales of Costanza".
I was kidding when I said that!
He's invulnerable to creditors.
Really?
Oh my god. Look at this.
The dating world is not a fun world...its a pressure world, its a world of tension, its a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I dont know what they need. I know I dont have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one Im- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, were all human beings, what is the story? Ive never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, Ive never been in a situation, when I thought to myself I could use a cotton-ball right now. I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they dont need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, theyre like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? Theyre huge and two days later, theyre out, theyre gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin with them? The only time I ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, theres two or three, that look like theyve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I dont know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl whos left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I dont know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. Lets move on. The dating world is a world of pressure. Lets face it a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance youll end up naked at the end of it. You know? Well, Bill, the boss thinks youre the man for the position, why dont you strip down and meet some of the people youll be workin with?
Alright, I'll talk to you later.
What's going on here. How is that possible?
Uncle Leo! What are you doing here?
Where?
No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.
This is amazing.
This is ridiculous.
Don't push me.
Is it padded?
Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.
Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?
I gotta do some research here.
Oh, that's too bad.
Hey.
humm...
Hard to say.
I don't know.
Where's George?
Bye bye
I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.
Rhode Island.
OUR LIVES!! . What kind of lives are these? We're like children. We're not men.
You did?
Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.
Well that was really fun, thanks.
She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.
He was 96 years old.
What is it?
Well...
Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)
No no, it was no joke.
What's wrong with her?
Shes subletting Carols place for a month.
That's the *least* of what you've accomplished...
Really? What happened?
Oh, it's enchanting.
Yeah, what else?
Yeah
Boy... I dont know.
I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting.
(taking the envelope) Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em.
(seeing Kramer struggle to open a soda, spilling it all over) I think the damage is probably already done. (interrupting Kramer's inadequate attempt to clean up the soda) All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene.
Well we went out one time. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
So?
Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?
So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.
"Slow it down"?
Why?
The bris?
I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..
So, go get them.
Okay, fine. (Jerry takes a coin from his pocket.) This is the official flip. No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and thats it. Agreed?
Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be.
Ok. (Kramer goes back to his apartment.)
I don't want you to call him.
I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.
Could you?
"Just one....gotta go back.....Oh but get this. Elaine, you will appreciate this. I'm sitting in Tim Whatley's waiting room...He's got a Penthouse right out on the table."
Oh.
Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?
I love the Drake!
This is gonna to be ugly. (quietly)
No, no, no, another race - out of the question.
Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.
It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?
China really?
Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?
What? What is it?
Oh, come on!
is beating the bushes-
(to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?
(uncertain) Yeah. I'm holding the baby.
Thanks.
Oh, I'm sure you do.
Oh, no?
So, how's everything going?
What did she name the kid?
Sorry. I don't have any tupperware.
Yes, a man gave you...?
Listen to this "I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."
hey
I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.
Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.
I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal?
I think that's a "what's good for the goose is good for the gander".
So it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato.
Hi Nana.
Yeah, it's one of my favorites.
Are these seats unbelievable or what?
Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Well its not like it's a really funny story or anything.
She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.
She's like a beautiful Godzilla.
Well, at least he didn't-
Where did you see that? Those are private!!!
All I did was shake your hand.
Where?
So theyre not paying you your
You guys both have class at the same time?
Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?
Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing?
(Pleading) George, I'm sorry.
This is Nikki.
Oh, yeah, that. Well...
Dad!
See you ... me and Kramer...
All right.. Go ahead.
Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.
That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.
Whatd'ya mean I stink?
Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...
(coyly) Oh, nothing important.
(uncertain) Don't you hire people to do that?
Hey, Tony.
Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?
Just chatting. Friendly.
(pause) All night?!
And what is that?
Have you tried the hamentashen?
Hey.
That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.
Who is it?
I came to pick you up.
As a guy I dont know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I dont know how to say, Bill, I feel I need to see other men. Do you know what I mean? Theres nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think thats the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because theyre two guys. Thats almost all we need to have in common. Cause sports  sports and women  is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, So, whats in the refrigerator?
(Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them!
I don't know how you do it.
Line two?
Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!
Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--
C'mon, will ya?
No.
Whenever I see the news and they're hauling in some kind of terrorist, psycho, maniac, mass murderer guy. You notice he's always covering up his face with the newspaper, with the jacket, with the hat. What is he worried about? I mean what is this man's reputation? That he has to worry about this kind of exposure damaging his good name? I mean, what is he up for a big job promotion down at the office or something? Afraid the boss is gonna catch this on TV and go "isn't that Johnson from sales? He's up in that clock tower picking people off one by one. I don't know if that's that kind of man we want heading up that new branch office. He should be in bill collection. I think he's got aptitude."
Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something.
(trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents.
It doesn't work like that.
You're the best.
I didn't know that...
I know Finland. Theyre neutral.
We're gonna have to talk about this later. (Elaine holds the door open for Jerry while holding her leg) Thank you. Taxi!
Oh, I cant. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly.
All I said was I liked the pen!
I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! **
This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.
He doesn't even care if a man answers.
(Sarcastic) You better hurry.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there.
So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?
I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.
(To George) You're givin' him back that TV.
Yeah.
But you gotta like their chances.
I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide.
(smugly, under-his-breath) Not only that, I broke his thumbs.
She knew that.
The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.
Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.
I don't.
(animated) You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about.
He took what out?
No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?
Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.
Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here.
All right. As long as youre okay. Because I cant stop thinking about her.
Huh.
I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.
The Kavorka? Whats that?
So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else in real estate?
Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.
Did you talk to her?
That's a shame.
What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!
Yeah.... well Elaine.
Ah, George turned it down.
(adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.
Why don't we just rent a movie?
I don't think so.
I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.
Can you grab a nap at work.
How did you know I was here?
How 'bout the march out?
Friday night.
Noit your type?
Huh?
I did.
No you didn't. He knows he's bald.
Well maybe he's got like a, cheerful mental hold on you.
Hello?
The cleaners? How did it get there?
Danish. Is it from Denmark?
Sit down, Elaine.
(Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.
Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.
Hi tide?
Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!
Not the gown again.
to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?
(to George) He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.
What if it's your hair?
You've made some Fine Exits.
Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. If you're there it'll be a better group.
Oh my god!!
Try and stay calm.
I don't really have enough room.
If I see her, what do I say that Im doing here in the building?
Why don't you just throw 'em out?
Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, Ill see ya.
Oh, stop it.
Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry.
(setting down a box) No thanks.
No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.
He's joking.
Youre kidding.
Have you tastes the soup?
Well, just give it back, and I wont say anything.
Thank you.
(as George picks up a broken piece of his car) You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out...
Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.
So you feel you were short changed.
Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them.
Oh my God is that the new perfume?
Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.
What do you mean, you snubbed her?
You tell me.
Oh, good.
The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.
(Correcting her) Edmund Fitzgerald.
All the time.
A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?
You fell on her?
I can't eat this.
Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit?
Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...
How you gonna do that?
Elaine got a new number because she died.
No what?
You cant have that coat, it's not yours.
Oh the baby's fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt.
Oh.
Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.
Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.
You should've had some eggs.
Elaine.
You've had the apple pie?
Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?
(looks in the creamer) Theres no milk in here, what...
Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.
Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I dont feel comfortable in them.
(sits up in bed) Oh what...
You got a lot to learn about pancakes.
Why don't you just have him paged?
Was it apple?
Oh, so hopelessness is the key.
The guy with the lizard.
Yeah, that's a point...
All right, but you have to go now.
Nodding off...
What? Nothing.
Why not?
Back together?
Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.
It's a must lie situation.
Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.
(as Kristin is storming out) Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?
Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?
Too late for that.
Not good.
I didn't know.
Yes!!!
Sorry about the Olympics.
Come on. Lets go
Have you slept with him yet?
You have a girlfriend?
That Pam! I am ga-ga over her!
Which is with who?
It completely turned her off.
Yes, A...?
So, I finally met the mentor.
How much was it to clean the vest?
"Of course" was the last thing he said?
Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.
Yeah, Im going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days.
Oh, I get it, this is about the button.
Hi.
I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles.
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..
So you want to just abolish all home package deliveries.
Take the K-man. A little support..
We're in the middle of a discussion here.
I think you know my policy.
Well, I think the whole thing stinks.
I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.
Don't worry. (she leaves)
What?
Oh look at this guy.
Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.
Well--
That woman is absolutely stunning.
Thanks, Lyle...
Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.
Actually, that's the definition of selfish.
Your father got arrested? For what?
I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.
Come again?
Look at this.
I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life.
Really? Her mother.
Yeah. Kramer made it.
Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place.
It's not legitimate.
(answering phone) Hello?
Oh yeah, right.
Yeah, well, it's honest.
(turns to greet Kramer) Hey.
I'll try and de-sour.
Big surprise.
What are ya gonna do?
You can tell me, I'll vault it.
Ouf.
Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.
A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!
Oh, why not?
Irked?
(not as eager) Hi Joan.
Yeah.
Nothing's happened.
All right, all right. Im sorry.
Yes.
You got lobster for everybody?
You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out Im giving you a raise.
Oh hi Enzo.
Soon, there's a couple of problems.
Well that's what's important.
There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing.
Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.
Yeah, maybe.
A velvet scrunchie!
Well. This should be a very interesting evening.
An Army Pete.
So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.
You spent the night at James's? Did we?
George.
Leo?
That's shocking, but sounds ...
So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. Whats the matter?
Oh, it's George.
Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?
Well, you're looking well.
I was saying the same thing.
In the back, on your right.
It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.
Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. and we got to talking, he sells Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.
Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - theyre doing sign language now.
Stop the mail?
That, that's tomato juice.
Hey.
Hey, there's the soda guy.
No lines.
Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.
Hey what are you doing Friday night?
Take the keys.
It's Sunday.
Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.
You're right. My fault.
"The Collected Works Of Bette Midler".
Ill call him. (Jerry picks up the cordless phone. He points to the rotary phone on the coffee table. Kramer, George, and Elaine struggle for it.) Hello, Ray?... Hi, Ray, this is Ravas friend, Elaines friend, Jerry... The King of Comedy, right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? (He covers the reciever and yells at Kramer and George.) Would you shut up?! (to the phone) Yeah, you dont want to talk about it over the phone?.. You dont want Rava to hear?... Yeah, I understand... You know that coffee shop near my house, Monks?... All right, tomorrow... One o clock... Great, okay, bye.
Oh, isn't that what it's all about?
Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?
Surprise! (he carries in the object)
You were livin' in the village then, right?
Oh, I got to see this thing.
I know.
(To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.
Oh! you just startin' now?
Excuse me, what?
No social reason for them to be here.
(to Mickey) Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?
Hey, I love a good caper.
Poor Beth.
Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.
Oh, you dont recall?
(flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb.
So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.
Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!
Very tasty.
I am. It was the world's first.
(Takes the ticket back and looks at it, flips it over) The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too.
Of course.
I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, "Oh This is so good. What's in it?" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not.
Yeah. Like a farm boy.
Thanks, because I would really like... (distractedly puts coffee cup back on the table)
George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.
Hi Uncle Leo.
Huh. Kurt's an organ donor.
I strained my neck last night.
(interrupting) Can I talk to you for a second?
You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends....
What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?
"The guy?"
Hey, Al.
What is it?
Are you sure he cant hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.
Friday night? Nothin', ... now.
Yeah, . . . seriously.
Well I, I can't believe this. I know Phil, he, he's a good friend of mine. We play softball together. How could this be?
No,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.
Yeah , she's coming to see my act tonight.
You ran over some pigeons? How many?
I'll call back, thank you. (hangs up the phone) He went to South America!
I was merely speaking extemporaneously.
Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks.
Alright, that's it.. (Grabs Kramer, trying to pull him out of the car)
Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender! (an event guard stops them)
(leaning round Kramer) Where?
George says hi.
Yeah.
So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.
Well, I cant wear it.
I don't feel so good.
So, Im gettin the insiders deal?
All right Ramon, Im going to get going.
What are you doing here?
What for?
"Big head" (Scoffs) That's almost a compliment.
Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.
Oh, and who might that be?
You're robbing me.
All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go.
But I went to the funeral.
It's like a game of tag.
Wow.That's hot.
I want to!
I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?
Oh, see that's not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people.
Why didn't you just ask her for it?
Well, her belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) Im bored. Talk to me.
I, I'm not happy with what I wrote.
Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.
Oh no.
So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.
The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.
Living or all time?
No, we're having an intervention
Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.
Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.
Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer.
Yeah, Friday's okay.
(acting like he was walking on stage) Hey how ya doing? Good to be here.
Standard. Micro.
Boy, he took it hard.
You asked her out?
I'm having surgery tomorrow.
(for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.
(motions of making out) Well you were involved in some sort of amorous...
What's the expiration date on that?
"Jerry"!
Because you were too busy stealing a book.
Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.
Oh, hi Ellen.
(picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt off?
Yeah, tomorrow.
How do you explain your apartment?
I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory.
Take some of mine.
I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?
The New Yorker?
Yeah thats a good deal -- you win the Pennant with that trade, hair for phlegm.
Look Kramer, i-i-if I'm gonna live over there, y-y-you gotta take some of this stuff out. I mean this thing is really freaking me out (holds up a ventriloquist dummy). I feel like its gonna come to life in the middle of the night and kill me.
So, where am I dropping you?
Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
Oh, you think I'm lying about this?
Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?
Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me.
No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
Kramer, should I call Susan?
Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me (flustered, he indicates a nose pick)
(laughing) Really? What a shock.
Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?
Oh, Kramer huh?
No, I kinda tried to test his hearing.
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little...
So you hurt Vincent's feelings?
I don't blame you. I blame myself.
No, what'd you say?
Hey! Kramer.
A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.
(to Elaine) Where's Kramer? Shouldn't he be here by now.
Sixty-six years old?
St. Elizabeth's Hospital? Why?
Right, Dana Folley.
You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.
I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?
What are you doing?
What is this?
(overhearing the other two) Oh, no.
Yknow what? This is not that bad an idea.
Ill tell you later.
Awright, let's eat already.
He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it.
I'm not a foodie. I don't, "Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty." Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book. What is this? The story of the bill? "Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.." What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating from the restaurant? What is this about?
I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.
I'm ready to talk.
No, I don't.
We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!
(catching keys) ...back, please?
Yea but...
Yeah.
That is worse.
I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table.
I love the day date. No wine, No shower.
Is this a repeat?
Sure.
(indicates the bowl of cereal) No milk?
No.
Hi Elaine.
I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, "Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me." But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?
Well, I have some money. What do you need? (pulls out some bills)
No.
(Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.
Great, you're lonely and miserable again. (presses button to call elevator)
I thought it was over there.
Yeah. Come on up.
Let's go.
(While looking at posters of women wearing glasses) I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.
You ready for the second one?
C'mon, out with it.
We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)
What, do you think I care about the money? Is that what you think? You want me to show you what I care about money? Here look, here look at this, here's a dollar here look, there, that?s how much I care about money.
If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.
Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.
(reaching into his pocket) Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for it.
I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.
Me, why?
(To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!
(Interrupting Bania) Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.
And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She says, "That's funny." ... That's funny!
We should get him something.
What do you expect? It's airline food.
(apologetic) Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.
It's your Christmas present.
How late are the stores open? Im thinking of maybe uh, buying a new TV and smash it over my head.
(picks it up) I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table.
John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.
Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house?
Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?
Let's go.
Either that, or theyve got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why dont you just go to the cashier?
"Transfer"?
George, I didnt sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. Im just going to be honest. Thats all... Yes, Im nervous... Are you listening to me?... Just put some soap on your finger. Itll slide right off... Then try axle grease... (Kramer enters; to the phone) Ill call you back after I talk to her... Bye.
Where do you *get* this?
All right. Put 'em on top.
(leaving) Konichi-wa.
Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?
You really want to?
Hey.
Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.
On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!
Yeah, but--
It smells like the beach.
"What about the Velvet Fog ?"
Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log.
I'm a comedian.
Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing?
So take a cab.
Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.
Here we go.
I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? "Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!"
Evry-Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. "Oh, is he good?" "Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best." They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, "You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. No, he's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher." And then there's always that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me." Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, "Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. And everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."
No ,no I don't, I mean, Don't be silly..
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else.
Oh, don't tell me. 'Cause he's black?
I don't know if they have land guys.
No, look, you don't understand. I, I want the picture.
He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.
But then I found out about the skin cancer.
Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange?
Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.
Hard to believe.
(answering phone) Y'hello.
Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
Oh yeah, well why don?t you Just get lost.
No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car.
Where you had, uh, wooden teeth.
Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--
Ah ha...
Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.
Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.
Breakfast?
If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!
(While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands him a nickel)
Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind.
Oh, great. That's great. What a night.
You know it and I ditched all my junk food.
You got me the air conditioner?
What do you recommend?
Hey.
Now what did you ask me again.
What?! Wha... what'd you put in there?
Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley.
Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.
youre a real pleasure. (Jerry is being sarcastic)
Ooh, nothing.
He's a very special maniac.
Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, thats a good idea.
No no no. No dinner.
Yeah.
(sarcastically) Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.
A beard?
Maybe youre right.
Dead man walking.
Boys, boys.
Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.
No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him.
She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.
That's right, lady!
What look?
Not our "all the way", their "all the way." I got the stink of responsibility on me.
What are you eating?
Really?
(Reading from his notebook) I got You enter, you go "Hi", and I go, "Hello." Now.. we need something here..
On the couch.
The door? You left the door open?
Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, "Photographs - Do not bend".
Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.
Yeah, it's pretty good.
Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.
Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.
He's not doing anything. Goodbye!
Hey, did you talk to the doctor?
What's happening?
No, but he's not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR)
Hello, Newman.
Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!
She could be an 'it'.
Shut up, you old bag!
Yeah.
So what'd you think?
(to the Drake) Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. (To Elaine) Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?
Sorry.
"Did you notice he always refer to himself in the third person. Jimmy can dunk. Jimmy's new in town. Jimmy we'll see you later."
Hey, it's okay.
They deliver wood?
Where?
What are you all dressed up for?
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..
So, what are you up for? How about Mexican?
(Hands him some mail) There you go. Merry Chirstmas!
'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?
Oh, really?
I'll be here.
She flipped out! Just left.
So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.
A bowl, ok?
Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job.
(talking to Beth on the phone) Could you put him on, I'd love to say hello.
All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?
Hey look , Champagne..
(after Bookman exits) That is one tough monkey! (turns to Elaine) So you were saying?
Pam!
I don't know. Nothing.?
No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.
Yes Mr. Bevilacqua.
Why don't you try your engagement story?
No.
What's the difference?
Yeah?
A Willard? Saccamano, Sr. screwed me!
So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?
After one date you try and improvise on her machine?
She'll have a cup of coffee and a broiled chicken.
What's wrong with him?
I'm banned?!
Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit) And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.
Well, I'll think about it...
It's the new J. Peterman catalog. Look.
But, your father's not bald.
(to Kramer) Hey (snaps fingers) get your stuff, let's get going.
Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.
No, Uncomfortable? Not at all. (ASIDE TO ELAINE) My friend's wife's breast sticking out - why would that make me uncomfortable?
[To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.
Ahhh...The Day..
No
(sarcastically) Oh, yeah.
Babu? (leaving) I'll be right back.
Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.
It was sold out!
Uh-huh, yeah. (Smiling, nodding, clearly wanting Bryant to shut up)
Maybe.
It's not bad.
Oh, here she comes.
Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line.
Really?
(Sees Elaine leaving) Hey! Wh-where are you?
This could only happen to you.
[quizzically] Live together?
Have a good time.
Well?
Hmm.
If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.
Ya that was some list.
Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?
Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.
Yeah, see you there.
Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (Jerry smiles. George laughs.) So, how's the book coming? (George's laughs taper off...) I say, how's the book comin'?
I like your nails, that is a great color.
Why are you calling my parents?
Hey, woahoh Fulton. It's me.
What?
No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.
I'm not joking!
I love a parade!
Hi.
"How's George?"
Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.
Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer!
(pulling Leo back in) Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you.
You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.
I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf.
The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!
Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.
Hmm. I thought she became a lesbian.
Oh God.
George, is this funny?
(doubtful) I don't know, do you have a--
You knocked him out.
This is my friend George.
Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it.
Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just "recede into the night," if you know what I mean.
You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it.
Then who?
So, um, do you date uh immature men?
I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?
Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner?
What I said. Ive been under a lot of stress.
What blankets?
It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.
Really?
"The Switch."
Get together?
I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
Alright.
(thinking) I cant believe it. I got nothing! I dont even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...
Uh, good.
Like with dogs.
Hey, not bad. (pointing to crest) I kinda like this little thing here.
Hey, I had nothing to do with it.
How much did you wound up tipping her?
One more lane to go.
The manager.
What the hell are you talking about?
How could you eat fish on a plane?
He was a nice guy.
Didn't go for it, huh?
You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!
I didn't know it was possible not to know that.
What if hes in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (Jerry knocks on imaginary glass.) How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? (He makes a hissing sound.) By the way, whats happening with Sendrax?
Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at no more than three miles an hour.
What? He can't do that.
I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?
and that's why you're going out with him
Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!
You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder?
(not) Oh. Too Bad.
Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it!
(to waiter) Ill have a cranberry juice with two limes.
(To George) Well, it's not about nothing.
(to Elaine) Harold and Manny.
What are you doing?
Well, that was the worst.
Nothing. I'm sure "Jon" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! (Laughs uproariously.)
I know what you mean.
Well, she is a woman.
Oh. like they wouldn't have found that anyway.
It's not a valet, it's a protg.
Ruthie Cohen?
...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the patient!
There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts.
It's stuck. (pained) Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood.
Mmhu.
There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of... (he cracks) Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?!
Uh, THANKS! This is FUN! Yeah, this turned out to be a GREAT weekend.
How come I haven't read about this?
What, he doesn't like my taste in music?
(Pleading) Leave me alone.
So, that's your poker face.
Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!
I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway.
(To cashier) I'd like to speak with the manager, please.
I was terrible.
It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it.
Eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I never know what to write on these things. I hate doin' this.
Who goes to South America?
Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?
Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!
You want him?
What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog.
Aaaaahhh...!!!
To a guy you've never met? (mild sarcasm) Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous.
Well, what's going on? What is this thing?
We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?
The buzzer.
Where are you goin'? Help me look!
Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
I would know if I had a blender.
I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?
(standing) How much d'you want for it?
I dont know. Its got a pink lining.
Alcohol.
All right, I'm worming.
Gillian. Hiii..
All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, "It's been real," move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.
He's a little backed up.
So, what are you doing this weekend?
Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.
The Improv is playing "Rochelle Rochelle" The musical.
Yes we will.
You put her on a pedestal.
Actually, it was a ********.
Because I know who has it.
(adamant) No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back.
Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)
What?
Yeah, I did that too.
The Drake is good!
Well, what do you think the big holdup is?
You can do that.
this is Jane Elaine
Well why don't you say it?
Perfect.
Yeah, well, until this bill is paid...
Are you sure?
(thinking) Yeah, thats normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?
to basically give this money away-
You crying from "Home Alone"??
So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?
What'd you think?
(Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 'French Impressionist Paintings'?
I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping.
What? Why didn't you wake me up?
Raspberry, Strawberry ...
Oh, maybe he's got no hot water.
I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.
So was I right? She likes me, right?
Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!
Done what?
Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine.
Yeah.
No, no of course not.
(admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.
No.
So?
Well what about her?
Are you sure you can't stay longer?
Good. (pause) Steak knife?
I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.
Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.
Fine...
She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.
I just a ssumed, ...
Well what about me?
Oh, that's a drag...
I better not.
Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.
What?
Uh, this is George. (reaches for her name) Im sorry...
You have to know, you must know.
We're getting vasectomies.
Sure, that would be great.
You haven't even seen it.
You know its not like changing toothpaste.
Peach.
Well Lisi, that was another-
Right you are.
You could take it? You want it?
Yeah, so I didn't miss anything?
Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.
Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.
Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle.
I don't have it!
I know, I know.
Dont worry. (whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!... Its Jerry!... Jerry!... From next door!... Never mind where I am!... Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!...
..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Packyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of (wipes his brow) pizza and uh the uh and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling em (does juggling motions) he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. (Swallows and takes a breath) Well we all just lost it. (Fulton not laughing, stone faced) It was really really funny.
I didn't notice the voice.
How is that possible?
L.A.?
No, nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table)
Yeah
With me?
So lemme get this straight you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an clair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, "What the hell, I'll just eat some trash."
Aah.
Yeah?
W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.
I saw it.
Oh my god. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops!
No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!
Newman . Open the door, Newman, I know you're in there.
I thought you'd like that.
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world He's Boring.
The boom box incident?
Also with her hands.
Mulva? (waves off George with his hand)
Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He couldn't! (listens) Alright, I will. (listens) Okay, bye.
Oh yeah, right...
Not even on the book jacket?
$875?
Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?
Yeah, and?
You're nuts!
You see the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around, but they don't know they're ugly, because nobody actually tells them.
(Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to look, but Jerry stops her) I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs.
You're good with the mothers.
You really like this girl.
You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.
Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town.
Ok, let's towel it up.
You don't have a car.
Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's uh yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it?
Just, uh, plop it on the counter there.
Many times. You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet.
Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.
You look like a pirate.
You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?
Me? Godfather?
You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?
Oh, whatever.
Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg.
(yelling) Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.
Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy.
You want to spend the rest of your life with her
You know I went out once with a nude model. Never let me see her naked. Hundreds of people see her naked every week, except me. Needless to say it was quite vexing.
Martine?
(smiles) Actually, I am a comedian.
He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes.
George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say,kookie talk.
I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from.
Kramer, you can't talk to Frank.
What for?
Oh, no, not beautiful.
Another time? What other time?
I dont believe this.
I don't know.
(Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.
Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, "Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. " "What are you watching?" "I don't care, I gotta keep going." "Who was that?" "I don't know what it was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going." Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, "Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel." You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, "Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of here. I'm going to bed."
Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?
This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.
I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?
Oh no.
UNDATEABLE!
He left me there. You see the mind games?
I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
Hello?
I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.
(Deeply sarcastic) No. You're never here.
(with a triumphant point) You're busted!
She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.
Okay, I will.
And here's the beauty--
Oh, she is, she absolutely is.
So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that...
Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!
Oh, I don't want to bother you.
Ya he's right here.
But we already knew that.
Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.
All right, so uh, let's do something later. How 'bout a movie?
I'm Dylan Murphy.
(pause) Not comfortable... (gets up again)
That's the point.
Oh no. Thats impossible. Id rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.
Uh, sometimes I use the sofa.
No, separated.
Aaah...
(hands up) I don't want it that way.
Did you write it down?
The captain of the toes. (phone rings) Hello.
Who?
Except the store's in Delaware.
Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.
She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass.
Yeah, I guess I slipped up.
I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. (Lena is puzzled.)
What?
Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the lunch with me?
Huh?
(continues)Like a shrimp farmer....
He's the Got-no-Green Lantern.
So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?
I really think you're making too much of this.
Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said "Too bad he's gay".
Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.
No deal. Not hot.
I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
Ooh yeah, the bags, sure.
What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!
Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up...
(jumps in surprise) Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be gone.
Anklets?
Newman. He's going with Newman.
I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.
Hello..
So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.
(not interested) Oh, I'm sure they are.
Kramer, it is not what you think.
George, I want you to promise me something. If Im ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.
Hey.
Oh, Hi.
Well it's not like spotting a toupee.
All right. Calm down.
Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.
What do you mean? Why wouldn't I know his name?
What? I dunno.
(pause) All right, sir.
I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.
Hello, Newman.
Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions.
If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.
Really.
Yknow Im sorry you had to leave so early the other night.
I really dont need to look.
Her tip.
Was I supposed to bring something?
(kidding) Uncle Leo?
C'mon Ponytail ...Get real.
This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.
What giant freak-head?
You certainly are. What's going on?
Does it ever bother you that this organization-
You can do that.
Irish, Scottish, whats the difference, lassie?
If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like Lex Luthor.
(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
Newman.
I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it.
It's funny!
But I'm so good.
Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.
All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now.
You too.
Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
(to Elaine, still joking) He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!
Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)
Where did you get that?
Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.
You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
What?
It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.
Yeah.
(handing it over) Here.
Well, Clyde might not tell him.
Hey, cable guy's looking for you.
Well, that all depends. . .
Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.
Kramer dating your room mate. It's funny.
Better.
What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.
From my house. I got a whole box of them.
Kramer, they're fumigating. There's toxic gas in there.
Poppy seeds!
Jim Fowler? The animal guy from "Wild Kingdom" is coming to your apartment?
That wasnt so bad, really.
He swore me to secrecy.
How so?
No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!
Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.
Astronaut!
What is it?
What do you make of it?
oh I'm sorry I didn't get most of that.. isn't that Kramer over there?
Alright, how much does he owe you?
Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?
I cant. What if he wakes up?
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.
You know, Kramer's gonna clean up on this place.
Can I ask you a question?
I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.
Really...
Ready for lunch?
(buzzes her up) Eh. (to Kramer) You know and I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying "my wife." Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - "my wife" this, "my wife" that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence.
Why are you doing this?
What about this? This is blood isn't it?!
Is he from the future?
Oh, yes.
Hang on.
(Pulls a small bottle out of his pocket) Uh-huh. Hey, look what they had on the plane. Schnapps.
Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.)
That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact.
Of course.
Wait 'til I tell him about the book.
Good evening, folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--
Eh.
So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?
Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.
I think I'm in love.
No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.
Yeah maybe you should.
Then, what was all that sniffing?
No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?
Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thingreal bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though.
Mr. Fields?
Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents.
Hey, where's Kramer?
The woman, she--
Whatever.
Why don't you see what you can do?
I did it for you.
(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
I dunno. Hard to say.
(Pulls the note out of his pocket) That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.
This Wednesday?
Oh, hello.
Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. (pointing at the umbrellas) What've you got in a push-button mini.
I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.
Prognosis *negative*!?
It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.
Yep. Since college. (Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.) Hey, Lena Small's on this list.
What happened to you? You were going like a hundred miles an hour.
George...
What'd you say?
What was I supposed to do? You knew I was on my first date with Elaine. You come barging in here asking me to contribute money for a volcano relief fund for krakatoa.
You dont know what it was.
I met her one time...
Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?
You're kidding?
I want the antidote, pimple popper!
So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.
Me? Why me?
(interrupts) What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today. (on the phone) Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we would do that. Okay. Great! Thanks a million! Okay, bye.
Ah, Kramer.
You see?!
That's him.
Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me...
You cant go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.
It's European.
...that's why men hunt and women nest.
I get it.
Because you threw it out.
Kramer!
I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...
Ooh-ooh
I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.
Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
I'm finding that out. (Kramer enters)
(to George) Hey, there's Pat. (calls) Hey, Pat.
No. No lunch.
(Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven!
Yeah.
Why?
There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.
So where you gonna sleep?
September 21st, first day of Autumn. Leaves changing colours.. Beautiful colors.
Hmm. So Cynthia's your mentor.
She's out.
Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin?
Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors.
Ok.
I dont wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do you think?
So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister...
Hey.
Good question. (More to himself than to Elaine) Why are we calling?
What for?
Live?
What about me?
So good for you.
Kramer!
oh look at that I got oil all over me. Can I have your napkin?
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.
O.K.!
Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.
Why not?
Thats got nothin to do with it.
We'll see about that. (Runs to the window and shouts up to Kramer, who's on the roof.) Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win!
Really?
More heavy gravy?
All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.
I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin else.
Scarf?
Hey what about Dr. Resnick My Uncle Leo is going to see him tomorrow .
Yeah, that's true...
No. I'm fine, thank you.
Who's she?
What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I would've done, if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!!
What did you say?
Comes in a wide variety of colors.
Oh I dont know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing.
I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!
We were just playin.'
When do you intend to do this?
So tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?
No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember.
(pulling on a jacket) Mmm-hmm.
I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.
Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.
Pennypacker.
(cutting in) I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman.
But we're in towels.
Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.
Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.
Hello Elaine? Patty Lawrence had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?
Well you're not Lois Lane.
(Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing?
This puddle on my sofa!
ya
Yeah?
(looking outside) Hey Newman, is that your red car?
That was an accident!
No.
Uh... sure/yeah..
Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him )
It had fat in it, it's not good for you.
He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.
Pull over? You can't pull over.
Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.
We're here discussing our script with your father.
Scared the hell out of that guy.
Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up) Since I said what?
Where have you been?!?
Shouldn't a doctor do it?
The dog?
I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?
Who wouldn't like him? I like him. And I'm a guy.
Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, "Oh. Tube socks." What are you gonna do about it?
That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.
Well don't get too comfortable. As soon as Seth gets a real job you two are gong back in that chicken supernova.
I would lose that.
Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)
What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?
I mean the whole thing, it's just...
All right, go ahead
So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial?
They're my socks!
No, its no problem at all.
No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
Nothing.
What happened?
Mmm
You quit the post office?
Hey!
Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.
Wow, the whole building burned down.
Its uh okay.
Hi Bob.
I'm not paying for anything until I get that back.
This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.
What's the difference?
No.
B.L.?
I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?
No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.
What's taking him so long out there?
What?
I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect.
How could she be smarter than you?
Hey Alec
Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one.
Binaca?
Really, an intervention ...
Elaine, what are you doin' down there?
But this is what you've always wanted.
Oh...
I was out in the snow last night.
Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!
Of course.
Is that my paper?
I'm blown away.
(aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!
Already?
So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.
Where do you suppose that could've come from?
We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.
I love crampbark.
Holy cow! Have a nice life.
And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.
Take it to the window.
Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.
Why?
(impressed) Who's that?
Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?
No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.
So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?
Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a One-woman show?
I don't know, whatever they do.
Elaine, let the man make his soup!
Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I would've asked her.
Shh! Nothing, nothing.
And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.
You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake.
If they like each other.
Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.
Yea.
I really wanna...
Theres the giant ball of oil. Clares right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!
Shes waking down the street and it hit her in the head!
What, you rented "Home Alone"?
Would you tell Susan about it?
Why dont you ask that doctor what it is?
Is this the proper venue?
What happened to your head when you got hit?
Who's got a tissues? I need more tissues! Look at this thing. It's my phone finger!
Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.
What causes homophobia? What is it, that makes a heterosexual man, worry? I think it's because, men know, that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, "Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'"
You're going to make a good father someday.
So why don't they talk like that now?
Well you said they could come and take the records.
All right, I'll call 911. Think he did it? Could've he done it? Couldn't done it? How could've he done it? Couldn't be? Could it? Hello 911? How are you? I'm sorry it was just a reflex...I know it's an emergency number...it is an emergency...my friend is being accused of being a smog strangler and I know he didn't do it...they're putting me trough to the detective in charge of the investigation...what is my name? Who am I? I'm eh...George Costanza...
Stop smelling your arm.
Everyday is my birthday. (Sarcastically joking off what George said)
Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-
So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?
This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.
Skin cancer! Damn.
Uh-ha.
Ill have the, ah, turkey club without the bacon.
Well, where is she?
You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?
Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!
Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. (pause) Did you?
So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!" So he says to me, "What are ya gonna do about it?"
That doesn't sound right.
5000.
Please, Donna...
Yeah.
Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.
No. No Suze.
Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.
Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ...
George, big news; I'm getting married!!
Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for? I don't know about that, I'll have to think about it. I'll let you know. Okay, bye.
No I haven't vomited in thirteen years.
How did you know?
Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!
How about adult contemporary?
This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.
What happened to Karen?
We could visit together!
Whats the difference?! Thats the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!
Hey. What's with your neck?
So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?
Yeah. So do I.
Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr.
No, thats great! Thats terrific!
Hi.
How could you go in there?
What?
It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.
What is goin' on in there?
No, I just had a sandwich.
More everything!
Hey Matthew.
Relax, hes late. Hes always late. Its part of his M.O.
No I haven't.
Yes. We did.
What happened to your mental alarm?!
Alright, alright, I'll cash the checks.
And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.
That's a five.
I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the "It's me" on the phone today.
They lost.
(exasperated) Ugh.
Yeah...
You don't think she's just talking to me?
I don't believe this. (They run into theater)
No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?
Lloyd.
Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?
Hello?
(reading, unimpressed) Ohh, 'Number 1 Dad'.
What happened to the jacket. Did he take it with him?
Cookies?
Wha--you have a low sperm count?
Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you.
He stole back the rye?
Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a...
Hi, I'm Jerry.
I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine...
No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.
Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place.
Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.
Hey, come on!
Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.
That's my cockney accent.
Thank you. Nice job.
I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.
You mean like.. (points to his hair)
How could they not fire you?
Yes, but lets just stop it right there.
What?
So how did this all happen?
Listen, uh I just remembered... Im... uh, getting a facial.
C'mon.
Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!
Hey, lll just keep swimming. Hey, hey. Im not done. I know what you're up to Ramon. Because Im a member here, this is my place to swim.
Where's Kramer?
Nothing.
Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.
How would you know? You don't speak Korean.
You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.
(tapping the spatula while waiting for waffles to be done) Any second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready.
What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.
And?
Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?
I tell ya, I don't see it happening.
That's not bad.
Why don't you get a sandwich?
(gesturing) This is Gary.
(looking at Kramer) This is nice.
What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display. (takes the peanut butter jar away from George)
Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.
(Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-
Keep your shirt on. I got it.
no I gotta go downtown
So *wash* *it*.
(dismissive) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?
(to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here.
I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.
Let me get a clean pair. (Goes into his room. George strides over to the window.)
No, you walk out.
The tap is tough.
That is so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood horse?
Hello, Willie.
Really? Since when?
I was. But, shes got me, like, hypnotized.
That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.
They're looking.
Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted.
Is that a sectional?
Me? What about you?
Neither have I.
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?
Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.
Hey look, there's a spot right in front.
"Jimmy"
Well yes I did that's true. A couple of a guys I knew in the coastguard told me about her.... and I sensed that she had the anger and intensity that I needed to make this film work.
(Apologetically) Oh, I'm sorry. Maestro.
Yeah, that's a good tip!
Take it.
I don't have it. You want half my omelet? (holds his omelet plate up to Bania)
But that's you.
Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way.
I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.
Oh you are beautiful!
Yeah, but now Im nervous.
Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.
I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.
Who is it?
No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me. She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised what's going on.
Wow! (hitting George)
What does that mean?
Coughing... naked... It's a turn-off, man.
I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?
No, no, I...
Can we just go?
What happened to Vincent?
It was life and death.
Hey whatever happened to Moochie?
You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...
...that's why men hunt and women nest.
But you don't smoke.
Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.
No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o.
Come on, Elaine!
Good.
Oh yea, I didn't even realize.
No, you'd have to be crazy.
Got what?
Where have you been? You know, you're on next.
Ma!
Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.
Ah. But they told us we must go now.
Mom, Dad.....I have fleas..
Boysenberry, Huckleberry ...
Well the-the crowd must have gone wild!
(thinking) Great. Thanks.
Uh huh...
So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!
Well, if I hear an anguished "oink", I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look (HE POINTS AT PASSERBY) Human, human, human... (HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR, WITH ALARM.) (WITH MOCK ALARM) Wait a second! (Grabs Kramer)
What are you all out of breath from?
We dont have two seconds?
What's going on out there?
How're things going?
C'mon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine)
I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.
I know it's a big problem.. she puts like four pieces in her mouth, it's ridiculous, I don't think we're gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
My Indian?
Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!
(pointing at the operation he mouths the words) Did it go in?
(in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.
But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.
Oh boy...
Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.
OK, I blame you.
She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was "Beaches" for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?
What are you saying?
Really.
He said they had a good time.
What? What did you--
(Confused) Where's the punchline?
Uh, yeah, I think I do.
How are you gonna do that?
Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! (Kramer exits.)
Elaine! No! No!
Wow.
Yikes!
Yellow? I wanted black.
The omelet. Damn.
Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?
SO?
By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
Shut up, you old bag!
This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?
No.
Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.
Alright.. (Heads for the door, grabbing his coat)
What?
(impatient) Gone! (starts maniacally laughing) (briefly stops to point and explain) That bumper sticker.
Alright.
You can't prove anything.
Uh, how about a couple of people like us.
You see , I kept up my end of the pact.
Alright!
Or something. Yeah, that's a date.
Yes.
I do.
But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.
What mustard stain?
Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?
Well...
Oh, you didn't see it.
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.
Yeah!
No, she's great! She's.. attractive, she's fun..
Your boys should stay in their neighborhood.
So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.
What's going on?
O.K. from now on I want you to call me "Jerry the Great".
I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.
What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?
See you later
Problem in the bedroom?
No, I don't have--
(Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!
Hey. So how was"Blame it on the Rain?"
(referring to George's outfit) And what mood is this.
How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a minute. Poppy's from Tuscany. I'm gonna go call him.
Who?
We're going to the Knick game!
Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full.
Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.
Should I?
He'll like you more...
All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a mnage  trois with her and her roommate.
You scared me!
No I don't.
Why do we have to leave?
Wait a second. (Grabs the icebucket off the counter.) This'll scare 'em off. (Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. Jerry gets back into bed.) Well, good night, Ollie.
Hey.
I long for you?
No, we have time.
You and me.
He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.
Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump over the net.
Well..
So what?
"They get all emotional , they sway. It's embarrassing."
Ya, see ya.
Well, you look, uh...relaxed.
I can see that.
No.
Wow! Hey, theres Clare. I better go down.
He can't just throw me off the plane!
Tell her you lost your itch.
And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
Ohh.. look at this..
Oooh that. Well...
There isn't?
So we'll talk about the hooks then?
No foolin'
So, George...
Number one?
Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?
What was on the list?
How did they know?!
You can barely see her face.
Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.
She didn't even want a napkin.
She got anything in your medicine cabinet?
Oh!.It's an affectionate caricature.
Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.
Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.
What're you talkin' about?
Back on the rack.
What blender? I don't have a blender.
What car?
No.
No. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
What should I do? (to Alton) Uh, were taking a cab, arent we?
What is it?
(Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.
Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, No egg white omelets. Look at that.
Hard to imagine.
Holland *is* the Netherlands.
You didn't get my papers?
Friday?
Ma, I told you, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan... Okay, bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Rava) My mother. She forgot how to make French toast. You know how mothers are.
He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.
What idea?
Okay. I mean, what if the--
Na, that's not such a good idea.
He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.
Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)
Hey...I'm not stupid. I'm looking in that drawer, there's no can opener.
You got a mickey source?
Oh.
Widower? Wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research)
You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs.
So?
No.
Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?
Kramer, you're still on the phone?
No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.
IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE!
Hey, that's great.
I just hope that whole pony incident didnt put a damper on the trip.
(accusing) You're not wearing a shirt, are you?
Really?
How's it coming?
Hey.
No I'm not...
Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.
Too Gubernatorial. (?)
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!
So George and I went up to NBC and we told them the idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract.
Below the equator?
Hello Newman.
He's joking.
Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?
Hey.
What do you need a hammer for?
You didn't mind?
His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I wouldve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. Hes so self-involved.
Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up(?). Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.
What about Puddy?
Elaine...
It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a "Tada!" gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say "I'll see ya.", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)
Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal.
They said they were interested in me.
He told me a few months ago.
Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?
Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.
Hey, what's going on over here?
Well, we gotta get it washed (pulls off a few flyers)....Ah, the keys are locked inside!
Aub, ah, Gipple?
Koko?
Ah, separate knob.
(Interested, still looking at the couple) Really?
What's the matter?
Hey!
Yeah, but with you it's intentional.
You know I don't even know why I brought you.
Fasten your seat belts. we're goin' to see the baby.
(pointing out the obvious) George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him.
Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!
You don't understand, ah
No, no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts.
Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.
"Yeah!!! What is that? I mean isn't that sick. I mean , I'd be embarrassed to have that in my apartment."
(Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.
Anyway Beth, you know i was thinking on my way over how when i was 9. I wanted these handball sneakers, they were all black but they came in adult sizes so you know i never got the sneakers. (Beth looks him confused)
Not a Federal record.
Geoffrey who?
(to George) Problems with the house guest?
You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin them whenever I want!
George!
So you want me to return it?
Help yourself.
(quiet annoyance) I don't write skits.
Yeah have a couple of pieces, weak, weak gum yeah
You want to go with me to NBC?
So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.
What does that mean?
Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)
Oh yeah.
Uh-huh.
Hey You're staying with my friend George.
Oh, man, look at this mess! You know what's gonna happen if they see this?
Paul again?
Kramer!
You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.
We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk.
Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)
I think Ive seen enough.
Yes I do.
He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
Wait a minute, that's my ticket! You didn't even want to go.
I'm flying down to Florida tomorrow.
See, again, I really don't feel that...
No, don't stop, Kramer. Keep going, don't let him get away.
...ho-ah. It's, it's, it's kitschy.
Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?
I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.
But gymnastics is not for everybody.
Look, let me just give you the forty, plus another twenty for your trouble.
Are you just screwing with me?
Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.
But it's a big complex.
I just met her, she's incredible.
She's playing, Pagliacci?s wife, Nedda.
So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?
You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?
What happened to you, pal?
What kind of pen is that?
I'm sorry.
I didn't do anything.
Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. (opens the fridge and gets a bottle of water.)
(hands it to him as he asks ELAINE) So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?
Hi shmoopy.
If my father was moving this hed had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (as his father) 'Have you got your end?...Your ends got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your ends got to come down.'
Walk me down to the Friars.
What are you doing here?
What about NBC? Did you hear anything?
Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you?
Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..
30 years.
I have aloe!
You won't even taste it?
What's the big rush?
Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?
You think?
Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner.
If not now, when?
Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket.
No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing.
Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?
Hi Pam.
It's okayit's just a hot dog, (still sobbing) everything is going to be okay.
No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.
I told you.
You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.
But why? Why McDowell?
No, I don't.
Whew. Did he wave?
Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order.
Good, good.
Good meeting?
Oh, no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down. (George & Jerry each slide to the end of their booth seats)
What are you talking about? I bombed!
You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.
You know I dont get that whole suicide machine. Theres no tall buildings where these people live? They cant wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?
Thank you very much.
Why'd you do that?
You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool.
You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.
Yeah.
How was the movie?
How are these your socks?!
I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.
All right. (goes into his hallway and comes back) You got my fins?
Right upstairs.
Elaine, he doesn't need-
I killed.
Well, how come?
Hey, Elaine.
Right. For the reducing of the pond scum?
Oh, I cant believe it. Let me see that. (Jerry takes the paper.) Thats four and a half points in three days! Thats almost half my money!
Oh my God.
What stone?
Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.
A Long Talker.
Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball?
Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?
Yeah, Uncle Leo.
alright I changed my mind, uh yeah I don't think I'm not gonna go now
Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,
Do you want box or hanger?
No.
Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.
You mean you just started sniffing?
Kramer, who'd you sell your ticket to?
He was what?!
Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!
So she didnt get the messages.
Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!
(Confused) I don't know what that means.
Hi.
I don't doubt it.
You got the picnic and burger traffic.
Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without.
Over here?
Youre still thinking about this?
See ya. (Jane Leaves; after the door closes Kramer jumps in shock) what's with you?
Yeah, see ya. (he hangs up)
Why?
Of course.
Look, you can hang out here if you want.
(smiling) Really? That's great. You said that to him?
I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
What are you talking about? It's my car. Let me pay for the gas.
(trying to shut the trunk hood) Something wrong with this trunk.
So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.
Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.
Tell you something...I do.
Oh, okay..
Oh my god, it's...
What's up?
Bye bye
What?
Tonight?
Oh, okay.
Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.
Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
Well, what street are you on?
Myra, Stan.
(surveying the restaurant) Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it!
Spending the night. Optional.
I wasn't thinking! I don't know.
(looking of into the distance) I guess that's true...
I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' (mimes throwing) 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?
Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'?
Star Trek II.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now.
Im meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.
And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?
Why?
I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?
What?
You think they have fleas there, don't you?
(writing) Here's my address and number. And really, thanks again.
No.
My stomach, I , think it was that cookie.
Would you turn that down! What is that crap!
Elaine
Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.
(Joking around) I think it's the stench of death.
I'm sorry, Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen)
Oh, you want to try the syrup! (Meryl smiles and takes it. The waitress comes over.)
Game?
(Pointing out) It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for "Avast ye matey" - what the hell does that mean?! "20 degrees off the starboard side - the Spanish Galleon!" - there's no comeback for that!
Great - I won.
I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
They cross the wires or something.
Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?
(removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?
I thought naked is good.
No, go ahead. Look at this place. I cant wait to get it cleaned.
Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad.
Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.
Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.
You met J. Peterman?
I don't like this Kramer. Will it be much longer?
Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea.
What do you got there?
Who?
That's the rule.
Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits)
(Starts to correct then realizes) Well...
Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.
Do you remember the curse toast?
Wait a second, I--
Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.
What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming "There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!" And then, when they all run into the other direction, we'll jump in the car!
Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. (Hands over Kramer's quilt.)
The one with the...(mumbles.)
Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody.
Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...
Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?
(bitter) Not at the moment, Brett.
Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!
Well what am I going to tell Alex?
Are you serious?
Lemme just check my messages. (to himself) Maybe a nicer girl called.
Maybe you're a little jealous.
Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?
Wait a second. *My* move?
Yeah.
You picked up on a vibe, from a nun.
What are you doing?
Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.
What was the dream?
Try to.
No, no, 12-8!
Thank you.
You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But its really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesnt it? "I really am a doctor you know. You think Im not, just check it out." I dont know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. "Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and Ill give you my opinion." After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what theyre talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants.
You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. Hmmm. What do you want?
Who said theres a problem?
Got it. (but now a man-hand grabs his arm) Uh!
I-
I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!
Oh, come on!
What?
So what?
Sure. If there cheap Why not.
(to the Drake) Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye...
Yeah.
Really.
There you go. That'll get you home in time.
Oh, come on!
I said luss. Im at a luss.
.....Stupid , stupid.
Maybe they've all been faking.
Oooh! Bay-bee *doll*!
Actually, yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!
So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?
Alright. So?
You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
Oh hi.
Oh, w-what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore?
I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?
God, you're right.
(Nodding) Okay, one-fifty.
That's it?
I usually like mine with an angioplasty.
What is that song?
With all the nudity?
Yeah, that's possible.
It's two roosters peckin' at each other!
I can see that. What's it for?
No, It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago . she's trying to become an actress.
Yeah, yeah. Dont worry about it.
Having her in jail.
Cheque. Now, the fact is, if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, yknow, cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they dont know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster (Jerry draws imaginary book from a holster.) Who do I make it out to? Theres my ID. Theres something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I dont know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, I dont have any money, but if youll contact these people, Im sure theyll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I dont have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?
Hey, guess what. I just bought my father a Cadillac
Kramer I don't think I can--
I don't want to stop her!
Here we go...
You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?
Ah, I'm jealous of everybody.
All right. Come on sit down. It's about to start.
I don't know.
Oh don't threaten me, Butcher Boy.
I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?
I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.
Oh, lithe!
So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--
Somehow I thought he'd be taller.
I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.
Look I really don't know what they're plans are.
Hi Jack.
Im not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll em down below my knee?
Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.
That smells good, what is that?
(tearing himself away from Christie) Huh?
No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.
I don't know how long this is gonna last.
But theyre talking about nothing.
On your mothers life?
You went back to the Jockeys?
He what?
the usual
(not excited) Youre engaged?
No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.
Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!
Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.
You're looking up movies for people now?
George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?
How could you not like the Drake?
I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
I know.
Hey, uncle Leo.
You're on fire today.
Did you hear what I said?
So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. Its a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and Im supposed to feel bad. Is that the way its supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldnt you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. Cause its not easy to give someone the toe, youve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... (Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) Look at that toe, buddy. (He puts his foot down.) I mean, thats really insulting to get the toe, isnt it?
They're not letting me in.
But, you know, what if, you know?
No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?
Well, maybe I'll just take it back.
Are you all right?
Ah, Tim Whatley. Out scalping?
So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.
I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes when someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within the gay community. They're probably discriminated against because of that, people say to them "Y'know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but I think think it's about time, y'know that you got in shape, tucked the shirt in and lost the wife". But if people are even going to assume that people that are neat are gay, maybe instead of doin' this, "Y'know I think Joe might be a little... [waves hand back and forth]", they should vacuum "Y'know I think Joe might be >vroom< [makes vacuuming motion]. Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little >vrooom<..."
(shocked) Wha, what are you talking about?
Hey, George, you know Tim Whatley.
And what, hope for a crash?
Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?
I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel.
No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.
I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!
Forget that. He's a ball player. MVP< 1979. I'm making wise cracks in some night club. This guy was in game six. They're a perfect match. They like go together. They're like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.
What is the point of all this?
I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...
(explanation) He's new around here.
Alright. (Elaine enters.)
He fired you?!?
Why?
I know a little.
Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.
You're meetin' the father for the first time?
You found the place.
(Jokingly playing off Kramer's statement) With a different body.
You. I'm talking about people.
Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?
Alright I'm going.
(disappointed) Oh, Hi, hi.
I don't know, but you better keep it up.
I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.
Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.
Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?
Hakuna Matata?
They're musicians. That's not a joke.
Oh, now you're being ridiculous.
Why?
Hey, wh-what--
I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.
So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?
I thought they smelled pretty nice.
Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
I'm not talking about upside down. (Jean-Paul and Kramer come in) I'm talking about waking him up!
Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?
You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."
So you saw Bania's act?
(pause) All right; let's move it out.
You got a little shmootz there (picks something on her sweater)
No, I just want some change.
I cant believe I do.
..What is this?
(taking a catalog) Can I have one? I need one of those old-looking phones. So you wanna grab a bite?
I'm buying you a new sofa.
Well Hello..
No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.
Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!
What? Why? What happened?
No. Yes you can. (he hangs on)
Hi, Louise.
The bad fianc&Mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...
What happened?
Girls. There's girls right here in the store. Look, look, there's one over there. Look, there's another one. Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there. What's the matter?
Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!
Next Wednesday.
Where did you get this?
What do you care? You don't believe in hell.
I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there.
Come on up. Okay, they're here.
Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant?
Well not technically.
Ya sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? (Meryl laughs. The owner of the coffee shop comes over.)
All because of Wrath of Khan?
(not enthousiastic at all) Oh, sure. Danny.
Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time.
On what?!
You shut up.
So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?
Eventually a little shot of penicillin
What did you say?
What happened?
Yeah.
Good. How was the roulette?
I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...
(after the guy) You think you're better than me?
(Smiling, nodding) Sure, Saturday night.
What do you mean replace it?
And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my...
Tim Whatley?
[not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]
Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document.
Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.
What is that, the Empire State Building?
Oh, it doesn't matter now.
who?
No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it. (thinks out loud, opens phone book) Becker, ... Becker, ...
What?
Bob. Oh, Bob.
No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.
Yeah, I cant eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I cant dance.
Oh no! >click click< Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!
(leaning out the window) Hey Georgie!
Another shot, I want another shot.
What's going on? You're the man of the hour, That's what's going on.
It's early.
You sold my Cadillac to Jack Klompus?
So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box.
Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours?
Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.
Hey.
Yeah, it was a gamble.
You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. (with a British accent) "Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you".
Fire station?
Thank you, thanks.
And where does it end? Then everyones doin it. Its like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, "Dont go there." - Someones gotta take a stand!
Maybe it's a shortcut.
I, dont see it happening.
Who makes copies?
It's over there. I know where it is.
Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?
Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?
By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine)
Typical things.
I'm going to be this guy's friend.
Yes I am skeptical.
Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets.
What do you need it for?
(Screams) GET OUT!
Yeah, and Poppie's got problems...
Well it's gone. Im sorry. Good-bye Bania.
Well it's not tragic.
Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.
Why?
(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!
They have gotten to know you.
Im good, thanks.
(sarcastic) Oh, great.
(in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room) Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad, you look so different.
There's none left?
I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? (Kramer comes in) A real dermatologist.
I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.
I don't care.
What are you talking about?
Well, it was sudden.
I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?
Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day.
He never heard of corduroy! True story, true story.
(Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not.
(bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.
(Joking around) Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.
Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!
Oh. yeah. Alright. (pushes Kramer and Elaine out the door, then sits next to Sidra on the couch.) So, where were we?
George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?
Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye. (hangs up the phone; turns to Kramer) You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.
The Bizarro coffeeshop?
Aah!
Oh, what are you doing here?
Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here.
So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what youre talking about, now, come on, come with me. (stands up) I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.
It was not!
You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.
Hey, so where's my sneakers?
What? Whats cool?
(proud to Peggy, under his breath) Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. (winks)
Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.
Up state! Hummm.
You got my spot?
I cant believe what Im hearing.
This is some FINE mutton.
Well, what is it?
All of a sudden he gets hungry.
Yeah, but John invited her.
Well, I don't think I want to date a protg whose mentor is a Costanza.
Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?
Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?
It's Kramer isn't it? I knew it!  The greasy door knob the constant licking of the fingers, he's hooked to the chicken isn't he?
Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!
To be polite? You are insane!
Hey. So, ah, Ramon this is my friend Elaine.
No economic reason for them to be here.
Thats all there is to it.
Who?
Hi.
Great job.
I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.
Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.
I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care
Thank you.
Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 1130.
What is the big deal?
Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?
Ok...
Oh, you think she was refunding?
Beautiful!
Well, I'm not.
It was a mix-up, I'm sure.
I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.
All right we're coming down.
See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.
(acidly) Shes full. So, Big Daddy. Im just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?
You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.
(A couple of days ago I used a public phone), go over time on the call, hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, "Yeah, operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?"
Enough chatting, let's play.
He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.
Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?
Who the hell is that?
Hey
You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner.
That doesn't work, we'll give 'em Kramer!
No, I don't want to.
Cant you talk to your boss?
George!
Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention, Elaine laughs) Maybe it's time you got a different hobby.
Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.
(On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.
Oh, that's bad. Especially that area.
Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.
No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?
Hey.
You saw her? What was she wearing?
Oh, get out of here.
Thanks, it's a breakaway.
Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What drives me to take chances like that?
....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant? Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it in there by helicopter, you know keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. "We got the hair but I think we lost the Zest." ....rejects the transplant with organs. Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . Guy just standin' there and suddenly... ..Bink! ( motions hair flying out of his head)........lands in someone's frozen yogurt.
Can I just get it opened first?
No, I believe it's next week.
Where are your clothes?
Your core temperature?
He was starin' at some woman!
You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.
Yeah, big surprise.
I was hoping you'd offer. (The intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
So I assume the jig was up.
Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer.
Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of?
Kramer!!! (Jerry points to the lamp post they are about to crash into)
I didn't do it!
(walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!
Thats what you want to see, yeah. . . . Yeah, you want to trade your hair for some phlegm.
You know what the odds are on a crash it's a million to one.
Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that.
She's okay.
C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.
Hotel?
(Peeved) I don't have any material!
For either one of us..
Babu?!
(to a woman) Hey, what's going on?
Stakes?
Alright. (Jerry opens the door for George)
There's a lot of change down there.
Uh, next week.
(looking over the list) Hmm ah. I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?
How you doing?
You know you're getting gypped over here.
You what?! Get out! (pushes Kramer) Ten thousand?
Hey. How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?
What?
I really think the M&M should be you.
You're sure?
Nice to meet ya!
Yeah.
He is merry, I'll give him that. (notices a cactus on the table) What's this plant for?
I don't know what to do.
Oh, man!
C'mon I need it.
You faked with me?
What are you doing?
oh uh nothing, she just.. choked on a jujube
How do you know?
You can't go to China What about your job?
What can I do?
As we all do.
Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...
The flight's been canceled?!?!
It's good to have you back.
He should have had a reverse peephole.
(Stammering) Oh, I, I, think I remember..
Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! Nice job on the circumcision but it's not supposed to be a finger.
Who are you?
Whats the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!
My car!
She said she'll do it.
Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, "Hey, they like the soup! Keep it up!"?
Oh, I'm gonna puke.
What else?
Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.
Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe-- "Jerry Jerry Dingleberry", and-hu "Seinsmelled"...
You just met the guy yesterday.
H-Hey, Kramer, wait up. I'll go with you.
Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?
Excuse me, uh...dentist? You a dentist? (The guy shakes his head. Jerry moves on to another guy.) Dentist? Are you a dentist?
so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?
Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.
I don't care, why are you telling me this?
I thought it was open to the public.
It's a schnoz.
Come back another time.
Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.
You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go... up.
It's Kramer.
Hey Fred.
You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.
Well you should tell her.
(unheard by Jenna) When the battery runs out.
Just me? No dudes or fellas?
Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) "Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."
Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like it?
Kramer...
Could we continue this another time.
Really.
I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy. You don't have to mention the bubble boy? I know about the bubble boy. I'm aware of the bubble boy. Why do you keep reminding me about the bubble boy?
And you're the model for this perfume?
Forget the bench.
" But I'm damaged goods now."
No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls.
So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night...
You're not allowed to have people over?
Alright.
Buyer beware.
I can't.
Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.
Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?
(Stopping him) No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!
No, it's...
Definitely?
Do you have it with you?
Yes. I do love her. (to baby) You have a very nice place here.
I dunno. (Elaine enters.) Hey.
What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.
I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.
Oh, come on, be a come-with guy.
So it had nothing to do with you.
Aww, right. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it!
What's all this stuff?
Uh oh.
Can you conduct your business elsewhere?
Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.
I don't want the coat.
What did she say?
Very handsome.
Really...
Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income.
Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?
(thinking; quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.
Yea.
Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.
Hello? Yeah he's here. (to Kramer) Hey! It's for you.
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. (casually leaves)
(Reasoning) You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place!
Oh yeah, what? "Buck Naked"?
Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. (They go out into the hallway and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.) Hey, how ya doin.'
I wanna buy back the Cadillac.
You're damn right you're not buying it!
Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?
Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I?
He called the right guy.
(Pointing) You're on.
(jocular) You got any kids?
Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.
The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.
No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?
There should be more people like us.
Ohh!
Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.
I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.
(sardonic) Oh. (smiles)
(Pointing) But are you still master of your domain?
Give my best to Hinckley.
Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?
Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*!
I hear you're going out with David Putty.
Well, thats good.
It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. "It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad." But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, "I refuse to put any thought into this at all." Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?
Its tremendous.
Good personality. Funny. Bright.
No no come on really, get another one. Itll take a second.
Well what is it?
So uh, what do you think?
Get out of here!
Yeah. Nine oclock.
How am I going to live with myself?!
Oh. It's in your eye now.
It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.
Thank you. (They continue walking)
Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--
Elaine? How did you rope her into this?
. . . All right (gritting teeth) Just give me the ticket.
All right, cmon. Lets go.
(to the door) Yeah?
You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?
That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.
...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, "Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now." "This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration." You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration, (waves imaginary wallet) "Here's fifty-six people that know me." Cop goes. "Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check."
Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?
Very good
Why don't you go out? It's nice out.
Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss.
So? What are friends for?
Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!
I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.
No.
What's she like?
You've got to have a story.
But I don't want to.
I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.
... if this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this woman to help me I would have killed this man. I would have strangled the life out of him with my bare hands
A present.
Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.
She's got 'it' written all over her.
I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.
Ah. Whered you go?
Oh, big fighting marlin. (Jerry acts like he is catching a marlin)
(shrugs) Hey George I think I want to bring a date to the wedding
"Where's my Mr. Goodbar?"
I dont know how this happened.
Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.
Where are you going, what?s the rush?
(sarcasm) Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.
Is that from my gift certificate?
Not for me, I love chatting.
What's his last name?
and GEORGE Ye, hu, um Ye,
I really wanna have fun.
Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.
Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.
I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.
I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'?
Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?
George Costanza is your mentor?
Come on in here.
But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.
Could we stop?
Too domestic.
Okay. No calls the next day.
Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.
Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
Wa, it's two weeks old.
(to himself) Still a rip-off.
What? I'm not looking. Nothing.
Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.
Come in for two minutes and sit with me.
The timeless art of seduction.
Well--
We're doing fine. How are you?
Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.
What are you up to?
Think so?
Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?
Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--
The New York Yankees?!
Well you're not even a fan. I was at game six - you didn't even watch it.
All right, forget it, its over, Im not moving.
'...downtown.'
I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that.
They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same.
You dont think that I killed her?
(answering the phone) Hello.
You think we can do it?
(back in booth) He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life.
What're you doing here?
What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?
Boy, its a good thing we came.
You know, the Maestro.
She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.
Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude.
Scary cold.
What about Susan?
Yeah.
And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.
I'm coming down.
Oh, really?
Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?
Y-You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set!
Well it was my idea.
He's somebody.
Maybe I'll check out France.
OH! Hey!!
I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.
Well, here we are...
What?
I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..
Owen March, I never heard of him.
Yeah.
Um hum.
Birds?
'The ocean called, They're running outta shrimp'?
...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.
Don't you need a little... help?
Oh... Why Fusilli?
I'm gonna call the cops. That?s what I?m doing, I?m calling the cops.
But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?
What about if youre not around?
Oh, you'll find out.
Yeah, Yeah!!
I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.
Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!
Who's that?
No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I dont know her name.
(on phone) Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago.
Mmmmmm!
It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.
Well, then Im not going to the game either. Okay? Ill give him both tickets.
You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there.
Itll take two seconds.
You are NOT sending me fifty dollars!
"No no you said George likes spicy chicken."
Just me?
Yeah, Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would you describe Kramer's hair?
What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!
No.
You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...
(seeing that Kramer has a new watch) What's that?
What did you say?
What's that perfume you're wearing?
Grandma Memma?
You don't want to go with me?
Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to go?
I cant believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.
Huh.
Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.
No they're not, they used to be.
Oh yeah.
What is it?
Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway.
Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.
Yeah, college was fun.
So you're okay with everything?
Hey. Look at you. Wha... what's this?
That's your move?
Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.
And you are it!
Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.
I'm Vandelay Industries?
No, I think the head does most of the stretching.
Can you relax, its a cup of coffee. Claire is a professional waitress.
Are you going to say anything?
You think she's got toes for thumbs?
ALL RIGHT, COME ON UP (Jerry puts his head down - he's not looking forward to Kenny Bania)
What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)
(accusingly) Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.
You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.
Hey, would you mind switching seats?
So you're pretending to be a tourist?
I think it has something to do with me.
Tell me what?
C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one.
(long pause).......Sure. ( humms a song then stares at the toothbrush)
All the time?!
But I'm not a disturbance!
All right?
Aaahhhhh!!
Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.
Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late.
Phone call? Who knows I'm here?
Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?
Yeah, he's a real phony.
Like you didn't call me a phony?
Yeah!.. Thanks.Oh! my god you saved my life.
It's almost a week.
She died.
What? I said right.
Well, there's nothing left. There's no food.
Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?
Who do I know who would have even been in a limousine yesterday anyway. Uhh-O h-owow!
Tractor!
Its good to see you.
Marine biology.
What?
Aah, top of the fridge. Hey George, I'm taking that waitress to the Tony's.
Yeah I guess I do owe you.
That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.
No! Dry-cleaned.
Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee)
They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.
(disoriented) How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?
(Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.
So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye.
You know it seems impossible.
The actress?
Shell call you back. Youre overreacting.
Hello.
What?
Just imports, no exports?
Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
Riverside Park.
Huh?
You're not a writer.
Elaine...
I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club...
Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.
(reluctant) Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too.
Sid left the keys in the car.
Hey.
I...don't remember.
Sure. See, things always even out for me.
(louder) Hey!!
Coming.
Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.
Really?
I wonder where Elaine is sitting? I really wanted you to meet her she's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend Tony
Tropic of Capricorn?
A-Ahahahahah. Who told you?
(Still pulling on Kramer's pants from the ankles) Man these are tight. (Yanking) Squinch your hips in
Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?
Fine.
Not exactly.
You're not gettin' any skin, Kramer.
No it isn't.
(thinking) They've gotta be kidding.
So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.
oh.. whoa..
Hows he doing?
I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..
Hey! How you doin'?
(to Stella) Her back hurts.
All right Nik. That's it.
She's right, George. Bottle-wipe is big.
Comedian.
" Yeah! What's that."
And then?
I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
I got isobutane-20.
Would do you think?
All right.
(whispers) Damn.
Yeah.
I've seen her in your building.
Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop, clip clop. They're nuts for it.
Oh, the dolphin thing?
Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for?
The washer fluid is fine.
(advancing on Gary) ...and he told me that that... (becomes indistinct)
Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer!
Tub is love.
Mulva?
(finishing) The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.
I'd be happy to.
Soo...
How can you think of food at the time like this?
(in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine) So did you figure out Darryl's... you know.
So how can you promise her?
See you later. (to Elaine) Well we cant all be dating podiatrists. (Elaine laughs)
Half of show business is here.
Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!
I tried to do that.
Are you okay?
(to Elaine) Where have you been?!
(Remembering) Oh, right. The big party..
He might want a show about anything and everything.
(interrupting) "Elaine , I really don't...............pay much attention to men`s faces."
I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
I think that would be a very nice gesture.
I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?
Bad situation.
Sorry, really.
Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.
(Trying to ward her off) Hey. Hey!
You gotta be there at 430.
Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.
Hey, hey, what are you doing, that?s my quarter.
I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.
No, it's ok.
Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.
I could tell.
Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?
Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. (They both walk to the booth and sit down. Suddenly, Gwen is attractive) Now this is a good looking booth.
And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.
Hey. (raises hands into fists of encouragement)
My Nana?
Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole!
Yeah.
That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it. (throws watch in garbage)
No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.
Where do you want to go?
What? No.
Fancy meeting you here!
Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?
Good, good, good... What's goin' on?
Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.
"What the hell's going on over there?"
(disbelief) Milos?
Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.
Okay.
(nudging George) Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.
(taps on the window) Hey...
I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for him for a second.
Why can't I be a soul mate?
Yeah. I really like her.
(imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape?
Playing today?
Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.
Hello, Charles.
We're dead.
Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference who's tall. We're all tall.
Corvelay?
So, who's gonna pull this thing?
You don't know? Come on, that's gold!
Of course its a sliding scale.
Not good
(unimpressed) So, what's this guy about?
Hold on a second.
Come on.
Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?
I invented that.
(downcast) Oh, I'm sorry.
What about my "questionable material"?
No, you stay here in the car.
What?
Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.
(holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the fridge?
Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.
I had a very interesting lunch with GEORGE Costanza today.
What was that?
Why? Why are they doing that?
"Don't you see what's happened, he couldn't talk , he's wearing these shoes, he's drooling."
All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the bottle of fungicide.)
Well? What do you think?
Are saying you're banning me from the store?
Uh-oh.
Who?
I don't know.
Gotta go. (heads out on stage)
It sounds like an excellent idea.
Get out of here.
OK, fine. 'What do I have to do to put you in this van today?'
Not that there's anything wrong with that...
I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.
(animated) Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and you sold a Cadillac?!
(TO GEORGE) Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?
In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.
Not now. She's right inside.
$40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
You never really had the right comeback, anyway.
More Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I don't even have any wood in the house!
How'd you get yours?
We could talk.
(Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.
Youre engaged?
Where's George
Well, not exactly.
Ah, will you stop it already?
Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye.
I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket.
You must have quite a time down there.
Hi Valerie.
Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?
Susan!
I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?
No, no.
I gotta go meet Pam.
He yells and you don't get your soup.
Yes. Yes I am! (to Helen) What else did she say on the phone?
Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys.
Somebody remember where we parked.
Kramer... (points to Marla)
What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do whatever it is you do. You disgust me.
Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?
Look! I don't want 'em!
I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
(Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything?
You're such...
I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?
You got a problem with paba?
Great? Where do you get great?
A cashmere sweater.
The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.
Oh no, it's Kenny Bania.
Seven?
Oh! Come om . He'll be over there for a half hour, he gets lost over there. C'mon so what is this about?
She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. [sarcastically] I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... >click click< Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? >click click< I'm back...
I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy could write checks to himself right out of my account.
(interrupting) Thanks, that's enough.
Well, this is it. I'm really gonna do something about my life, you know? You know, I think I'm gonna call Melanie again. So what if she shushed me. GEORGE, I am really gonna make some changes.
Well, I'm calling this off right now.
What floss? When?
You know I can't get this *damn thing* to sleep. (about the Yo-Yo)
How do you like that?
Sure, go ahead.
No. No, no way, no Bania.
Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!
Ho-ly!
Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker.
Im worried I wont be able to talk to him. Hes such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.
That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.
That's right, I'm taking a dive.
Giddee up!
Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad.
Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.
I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
Under arrest? What for?
(Carrying her out, piggy-back style) No, what?
On your heart?
But that's not what she thinks.
No.
Whew
Yeah. You said you liked horse manure.
Oh, hi Evelyn.
Why?
Very good looking.
What is this? "Murphy Brown"?
Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?
Sue Ellen Mishke?
Ah, well. Thank you very much!
(whispers) You can't just have water.
(to the phone) Hello? (disappointed) Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) No. Uh, I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesnt know anything. Hes just my next-door neighbor. Uh, nothing much... Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. Im meeting somebody... Uh, Wednesday? Wednesdays okay... All right. Uh, Im a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning?... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone.
You're crazy.
All right. You know this girl Clare I am seeing?
How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!
C'mon, put the top up, it's November!
Don't go a-knockin'.
Its a list of excuses, its for that guy, Horneck, whos at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I dont have to see him. (Elaine laughs.) I need it. (Elaine starts writing on the list.) What are you doing?
Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one.
I thought you might.
Bit you?!
You know why? Because people like to say "salsa." "Excuse me, do you have salsa?" "We need more salsa." "Where is the salsa? No salsa?"
Okay, so how does it go?
Well you'd be naked of course.
You need to talk?
Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.
Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.
Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.
And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.
I can't believe this.
What kind of company is it?
Well, you want your organizer back don't you?
Yes, I do.
What do you think?
She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.
(doubtful) Yeah, you'll make it up to me.
Hey look at you.
I don't think that's it.
Like toothpaste?
Nice!
(Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.
So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.
Oh No, wait a second... Wait a second... I-I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name.
What?
Ya, that's the.. last thing you want to see. Well, next to last.
I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door...
Five, ten minutes.
Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this?
What the hell he's supposed to be on medication I don't understand he told me he's getting medication what happened to his medication!?
Kramer, what are you doing here?
Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.
What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?
Aren't you going to take the check down?
Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. I'm being audited.
What else did you two do?
Kramer, why do you have to (noticing Newman) Hello, Newman.
Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.
I don't know, this? (Shows his neck to Sara.)
Sure. (points at booth) How about this one?
Oh.
(In pain) Oh, are you about done?
Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits on a couch.) Hey, what about this one?
(turning on the commercial) Right, quiet dignity. As opposed to, say, this?
So, when do I get my dinner?
Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?
I didn't know she was married.
Hey listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, why don't you have dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if you want, you know, have a little company, take the pressure off.
No I dont see it.
What is that, a 12 gauge?
Yeah.
Oh, no. It is. Just be still.
How could she not tell me where she was staying?
oh I though you didn't care about his looks
Hey, maybe I should get Elaine something.
Some new kind of pie.
He took It, Out?
But I thought things were going great.
Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!
aha
Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.
Did you get that at Joe's?
Yeah, uh, Ok, uh, tomorrow uh, where da ya - where do you live, uh, up town? Upper west side?
(handing her a magazine) Here, read this.
Why?
Well, frankly it is.
You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I give you 50 bucks.
yeah stinks, terrible
Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry won't let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesnt that bother you?
They're Cuban cigar rollers.
Who was in town on a business venture, and um..
(takes the card from Elaine) We had a little fight this afternoon. (reading from card) Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe.
And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
Yeah?
Tatiana...
Well that's a start.
Yeah.
She doesn't have toe thumbs.
Surprise!
(dialing) He got em out of the house.
Yeah, I started out real classy...
Is not.
I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.
Yeah.. how about this I say "How's it goin'?"
...the food court is closed.
You bought it for six!
For both of us.
Okay, okay. I'll be right back.
Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, "Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms."
Really, stopping short. That's a good move.
Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? (hands Elaine the tape recorder.)
The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.
Oh that's George. (presses the intercom button) Yeah?
Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?
So get this we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.
Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. Im sure theyd just as soon give it to you, but youd have to come up with that money.
No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!
I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?
You wanna know? Come on outside.
What'd ya do?
Alright, its time to go.
He was down at the other end. So he yells out, "Ready, On your mark, Get set, " and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.
She's very assimilated.
So you just did the opposite of everything?
Yes I do.
Kramer won't sell.
Yeah, well you're going.
Uh... great.
Yeah. Howd ya do that?
She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.
So...
Suspected serial killer, he didn't actually do it.
Kramer.
I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy.
No move. So, you see, its all part of a divine plan.
Excuse me?
Morning.
Things are good?
Darryl. He's black, isn't he?
A virgin.
Hi.
Well, I just want you to know I'm there for you. Course now I'm here for you, but when i'm not here for you, i'm there for you.
Oh yeah, I knew.
I'm not touching that thing.
You can't even play.
Ah, non-smoking would be great.
Oh yeah, Steinbrenner...
You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.
He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.
Hi Elaine, this is Angela.
So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything.
Oh, My god.
Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.
I guess Im coming. I mean...
Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...
(to the phone) Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you- Oh, Hi. Joel... Oh, you just came in... Listen, I cant make it to the game tonight... I, uh, have to tutor my nephew... Yeah, hes got an exam tomorrow... Geometry... You know, trapezoids, rhombus... Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. Theyre at the Will-Call window... And Im really sorry... Have a good time... Well talk next week... Okay... Yeah, I dont... Fine.. Fine... Bye.
Good.
Are you alright?
Oh, then I'm not worried.
Yeah.
(Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.
Honey, what'd you do with the can opener?
Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...
Well at least you and I are okay again.
Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.
Is that something you want to do?
Yeah! Because of you.
Yeah.
I told you not to come.
Yes, it is!
I'm serious!
Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.
Loni Anderson.
What?
Yeah.
Well. Well.
Elaine!
The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal.
You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.)
My car? You drove it into the swamp!
Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time.
No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.
(watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans?
Is she?
Oh, Kramer, I -
Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?
Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes.
It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!
No, they won't call the police.
Nothin' What do you want?
And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.
So, are you gonna go out with her?
George?
Oh yeah, I know.
(hanging up the phone) Oh! There's my Chinese food, I gotta run. All you.
You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.
You're complaining about a private jet?
Uh! Really .That's nice.
Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...
Is there a captain's hat involved in this?
Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!
Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?
All right. Enjoy"Blame it on the Rain"
I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.
Well, you know..
(OC) Hey everybody! Who's ready to laugh?
No, Poppie! No!!
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.
Hey. Why didn't cha get the big one?
We cold play Sorry! We cold play Steal the Old Mans Bundle. (Vanessa not amused; Jerry thinking) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to Vanessa) What kind of perfume is that youre wearing?
Hey. How'd it go with Gary?
How do you account for this?
Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.
(To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.
Yeah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.
(to the phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)
It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?
No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.
How you feeling?
(feeling face) Good shave today...
Hey, what size suit are you?
Theres more. The refrigerator.
Are we about throw here Newman?
Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.
You ready?
(still watching tv; sounds like basketball) Bottle-wipe supercedes it.
The" coup d-toe"
There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it..
I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
No, nothing.
Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?
Is that so?
Ah...that's a big responsability on your hands.
So you're never gonna have sex again?
So that's here?
(Pointing off screen, nodding) THAT I heard.
So I finally get to meet your pal Joey.
Yeah. Okay then.
Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.
Hairdo?
Oh.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good things.
My what?
(In awe. Whispering) The botched it?
We don't hear that. (They enter the elevator)
So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.
Well this is very awkward.
Entertainment Tonight's on.
I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?
(to George) I mean, come on. (a thought occurs) No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from *Seals and Croft*.
(getting it) Ahh. Wit-chay Woman.
You're not paying for it.
No, I don't drink coffee.
Oh so you still don't believe us.
What?
Don't look at him. (Phil starts to knock on the door)
Good for you.
Everything?
(Pleading) I tried my best!
He's kind of tied up here.
Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
Oh, Hey, there's a name you don't forget.
Kramer, outta the car. Out, now!
Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.
No...
But why?
Yeah.
She's been in Mexico for six weeks.
Did you bump into anybody you knew?
(George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party?
You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world "I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable." (George is baffled)
You werent?
Why would I wanna do that?
What is she making?
How could you ask her out?
I had to.
You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.
It is exciting.
Of course, I always do.
What about?
You know 'm just curious, How did you know she wasn't my girlfriend?
What do you want?
Hi, I'm Jerry.
Oh hi Jack.
So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?
Oh, it's a scene man.
Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I, guess she passed out!
Good, good. You remember George.
No thanks.
There's nothing wrong with my career!
A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?
(Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.
Respect, admiration, prestige.
So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.
Oh, that's classy.
Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of lobster)
Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...
Hey George.
I can manage.
Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...
I've never done it before.
(Obviously resents talking to her) Yes.
Well this is a great place to sit you got here.
Oh, come on.
Name tags?
Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.
Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.
Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.
I forgot my toothbrush.
Okay.
Yeah, he just walked by.
(looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!
No, I'll crab it.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Hello, Poppie. This is Elaine.
Alright, sit down, sit down. (Grabs a pill from the bottle, and starts advancing tward Kramer - like an owner with his dog)
What if he doesn't call now out of spite?
The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.
Hey Richie
SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?
Oh, no.
Like what?
(Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.
Nah, Ill go get the robe.
Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino.
It's this one here in the back. (Tilts his head back, and knocks Elaine's trophy out the window. A loud hissing sound and commotion is heard from the street below. Everyone runs to the windows to look.)
I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
AH. Yes that's gonna make a big difference.
Pretend it's interesting.
75,000 lira.
How do you get all that wood in here?
Wait a second, don't you--
Go outside and see if he's still there.
Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.
Ah, dinner! Thats it, youre all the way back!
Can I try it?
Kramer! The stone!
I was listening!
Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.
Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
Yeah, thats good. Hed clunk our heads together like Moe.
Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.
No! Stop it! Kramer, stop it!
(walking towards door with Elaine) How long did you last? (opens door)
Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?
Who's stopping you?
Oh, a walk, well --
Yeah.
12 gauge. Seems to be the most popular gauge.
Yeah... hes specializing in whales. He's working on lowering the cholesterol level, in whales all that blubber -- quite unhealthy. You know its the largest mammal on earth but as George says "they don't have to be."
He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. He's a time slot hit.
So what?
Let me just wipe the sink.
Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?
Oh Diane.
I don't mind the cemetery.
I'm not wearing the fur.
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?
Why shouldn't I go here?
Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night.
Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!
Elaine?
So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?
Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.
Damn, I was too overanxious, he must have noticed that.
Fine.
Wasn't that kind of important?
What do you mean?
Where are they moving to?
Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city.
(checking out George's textbook) Risk management?
Hi, happy birthday.
And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises.
Well you should hear the message from my nut. Where's George and Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, I feel very vulnerable.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Vanessa, thank you. Ive been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.
Ah, no thanks.
Oh who made you a Mohel? Whadya, get your degree from a matchbook?
Yeah. Because she threw out my napkin.
(neutral) Fine.
Obviously.
(a la "Don Corleone") Never go against the family, Elaine.
Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.
Hey.
You didn't look down?
Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him.
Is that your "chicken" making all that noise?
The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.
I know, I know...
Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.
Oh yeah. He's good. You know he's John Ritter's cousin.
Ah, here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) Mmm, delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some.
Oh, I see. So you can go, "Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!"
(grabs the ticket back) Give me that.
And what did she do?
Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.
No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!
Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.
What? (to George) What did, what did you say?
See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. (Elaine laughs.) All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free.
(protesting) I..I didn't say that.
Hey.
(To Amy) Aha! So it's true! You were making out with him!
(thinking) This is brutal.
(Mesmerized) What are you, a scientist?!
Nah. You two go.
Well, Rabbi, well.
You mean that wasn't uh.
"AMCA?"
I'll see you tonight. (he's opening his door apartment as Kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe)
Hey, I got a real thing about "shushing"!
Yeah?
Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.
No, no......(long pause . they stare at the walls) Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?
With that?
(like a frustrated child) Why can't I know?
Oh Hi.
Hola.
I don't think so...
Sure.
Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?
What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.
I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.
What is this?
Oh yeah, hold on.
Ok.
So, what's your first book?
Down here?
Yeah.. yeah.
The whole block, forty, fifty cars.
Okay, Newman, thanks a lot.
Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on.
The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like youre always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. Youre out somewhere with people, Gee, you look pregnant.. are you? Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, thats not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Lets take this whole scene again. People, think about what youre saying!
Hey! Whattaya know!
Sure, its like robbing a bank. You dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.
Yes, Jugdish.
Yeah.
All right, here!
Yes I do, Kramer.
That's because she had my mail.
Oh, the best revenge is living well.
That?s what I?ll do, I?ll just call him and tell him, I?ll tell him. That?s all I?ll do. He's a human being, I?ll talk to him. He'll understand. Right?
She's good looking.
And the other.
Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.
Nexus of the universe. Hey, Cindy. Cindy.
All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.
Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.
So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?
Hello?
Nice to see you. This is Elaine.
There's really not that much to tell.
No I can't I've got some stuff to do then I've got to meet Keith at my apartment at three. I'm helping him move.
Duncan Meyers!
Excuse me?!
I'm not taking anyone's side.
(about the pie) This is no good.
When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!
Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes.
It's like watching an animal get tortured.
A long, long weekend.
Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.
Yeah, Im sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.
Well, Im sure you did. Who wouldnt love a pony? Who wouldnt love a person that had a pony?
And you didnt even hear how she sounded.
Right by her?
They guy's in my house right now. What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.
Me too.
Have I ever been less than forthright?
You could not like it.
No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.
Yeah Ive got this old bottle of cough medicine.
Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.
Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal right now. (covers Jean-Paul with a blanket)
I'm out.
Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!
Ohh. Hey, how you feeling?
So......Susan's dead.....
Yeah, see you.
All right lets go.
So very gorgeous.
Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little longer)
It's green.
Oh.
Alright, c'mon up.
Oh yeah, I know.
Yeah, that was bad.
(interested) Really?
No, it's part of the contest rules.
You know what? I'll be with you in a minute.
Alright. (Hangs up)
I don't believe this.
So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up The good, the bad, or the ugly.
(hesitatingly) ... no...
(Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in.
No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.
Face to face.
You have a standard fake?
Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper of the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack . . .
I used it up
..And then she starts talking about her panties.
No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.
85 cents? That is Outrageous!
What? The physical therapist? Why?
Hi.
All right now you listen and you listen good! (he grabs Kramer's legs and throws him down the couch)
Hey.
Too bad.
I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem.
I haven't been out yet.
I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?
That's the spirit. You suck!
Yeah.
(Cutting him off) Thank you very much.
What the hell are you doing there?
Hello. Oh! Hi George.......What! ..really! All right I'll call Elaine , we'll meet you down there.
I love you, George. Come here.
No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?
Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?
And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
..living together after a while we... we might start to get on each others nerves a little.
I think Ive played there.
Why?
Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.
Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.
Right above me.
Come on Newman. Do it.
Turn up the heat in your apartment! (opens a window)
You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em.
You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. (Elaine smiles and rolls her eyes at him) What brings you here?
Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket?
(sarcastic) Yeah, you told me.
Why?
And I'm always impressed.
Congratulations!
Why didn't you pull over?
And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table)
No, thank you.
Thank you.
Ohhhhh.. John-John.
So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.
Mickey Mantle?
Is someone there?
Alright, that's very good. Thank you.
You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that.
(calm) I ordered in. It's still effort.
No, no, there's no side!
Me?
Yeah.
Well, I want to sit down.
Stealing? You loaned her the racquet!
Yeah
I didn't know he wasn't invited.
Ok. Uh
Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...
Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.
Yeah.
Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay... is uh...
John Houseman?
Uh, I don't think so.
What are you looking for?
Would you?
Yeah, right.
What you got, a pair of bullets?
I can't. The car's at the mechanics.
Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--
Hi.
What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him? I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he?
Elaine was... in a rush.
A little.
But someone is waiting for me!
Well, I have this neighbor...
"The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour". I'm confused.
You satisfied? So you see?
Oh, hi Valerie. What's up?
Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...
Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.
What, she gave me hives?
Oh my!
Bye
I'm in the middle of a story.
Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana.
But you did actually throw his coat out the window.
Well Im glad it's working out.
I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.
Hmmmm...
You didnt see him. It was horrible.
Oh, you got something goin'.
Hi!
Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more.
. . . I can't.
All taken care of.
I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.
Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)
What's his name?
Oh my... that *is* refreshing...
She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?
And if you do?
Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.
Get outta here!
Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... what kind of a sicko would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide (small fingers opening imaginary drawers) Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT hard to get round black buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this? ... is it such a great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, you'll never find them - they save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they're going to fall off too that's the other thing ...
That. (pointing at George)
Yeah.
Great day in the morning.
Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal.
Lippman?
Yeah! I think I got flea bites.
(into phone) Hello Joe, listen this is Jerry Seinfeld, I really think there?s been a huge colossal misunderstanding,
Can't you just listen to me?
(thinking) Well, the drive home should be a delight. Im speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I dont care. (to Vanessa) That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room?
Well, this is all very sophisticated.
See?
Yeah.
Oh, when did that happen?
Good for you
You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.
You're not paying.
(Arms out, complaining) I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!
(As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George.
Whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guyll be like, I dont think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life? And of course the womans looking at the guy, thinking, What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?
Hello, Susan? It's Jerry.
No. We both just saw the same monkey.
No ,it's George ( Elaine laughs heartily)
We had that babka.
What?
What are you doing here?
Oh! well whatever you have to do.
You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.
Why, you don't think it's a good job?
Alright. Seems like...a strange choice.
I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!
Why don't you put it in the *bank*?
Right.
(to the phone) No believe me, Im always up at this hour. How are you?... Great... Sure... What time does the plane get in?... I got my friend George to take me...
No, no, no, it's... "She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her."
Euhh...Elaine....
Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
Nah.
A pinkish hue?
Hey you know we were just talking about you.
Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?
Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home?
Listen, Matthew, I-I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do.
Yeah, you, me and George.
Uh huh. Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?
You what?
And yet he continues to live.
(seems sincere) Yeah, I'm really sorry, uh.
Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here...
Expecting Newman? That's funny because I just happened upon him down at the Kenny Roger's Roasters.
Sponge-worthy?
(pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you lay it out on the bed.
Ohh.
No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy.
I don't know.
Would. Does. Is.
I love you, Costanza.
Again
Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?
Yes?
Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!
Wow! Joe Pepitone!
[in French accent] Pardon.
Yeah.
Yeah, come on Elaine, lets go.
Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.
Why not?
Okay. (closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self) Didn't come true.
What are <you> doing here?
Why?
Inside the van?
Exactly
She had man-hands.
So, uh, how are things with Jerry?
Anything else?
yeah. I think I do.
I think Chemical Bank.
The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go "Excuse me, I think you missed a spot."
When you hear like a soft russeling.
Maybe I'll let you pick me up.
Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together.
Buh bye.
How are we gonna get out of it?
George, george...
Yeah well King Edward didnt live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.
I don't know, "Hi".
George, I am loving this no wallet thing.
Kramer.
(turning to each other) I dont know. Hes an importer.
What's the matter?
No, I don't.
No.
You know what's good for that? Relish.
Well, what does he do?
You didn't have to push me.
A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?
So did I do a terrible thing?
Who, criminals?
Really, Im not answering anymore.
You gonna be alright here?
No.
(to himself) Hmm, testy.
I'll see you later.
Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.
Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.
Biff?
Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!
Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)
(places two slices of bread against Kramer's face) That is close.
Dirt? That's alright, (for Jenna's benefit) because there's nothing wrong with dirt.
Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD.
I dont need any more.
Oh, wow.
Hey.
Have you ever heard of egg salad?
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.
Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die.
Im Dan. Can I have my list back, please?
I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
Look, its a very awkward situation. I dont wanna be presumptuous.
I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.
Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.
I thought you said it was imminent.
We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie.
Im sorry.
Mm. That's fantastic. (he could care less)
It's not even my car, it's a rental.
It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look (searches for word) stupid. (to salesman) I'm sorry.
You stink. You know you stink. What is this?
Pull over? The lieutenant is waiting to see us.
Unbelievable! She's not there.
Aww.
Oh, alright ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....
Why dont they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, Just Back. All back; No front. You walk in the front, youre immediately in the back. (Jerry picks up a tie display, and shakes it rhythmically from left to right.) Look, Elaine, tie carwash.
(on phone)Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.... it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye.
If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.
Well, what happened? Was she there?
Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''. And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. "Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''.
Happy camper , I don't hear that expression enough.
No, you stay here in the car. I may need you.
On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?
(Shocked) You're telling me.
Well, maybe he's --
What press?
No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.
Why? He's harmless.
Hi. Can I use your bathroom?
Great!
And, best of all, it's a Cadillac.
(shock) What?!
There's no precedent, baby!
Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.
So how was it?
Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?
Gee, I just didnt expect it from the way youve been acting.
Wow. Kenny Rogers Roasters. Finally open. Hey, look at the size of that neon chicken on the roof.
A uh, a person that uh...
Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice.
No tune.
Hey.
Why?
So you called the cop a pig?
You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.
What happened to you?
There it is!...No, no that's a Toyota.
Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.
True. You mean, for you?
[with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?!
You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?
Really?
One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub.
Without Elaine? What for?
There's a naked woman across the street.
They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again.
Hey, check the TV.
Give me the clothes.
One Tim Whatley!
Well, I dont really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.
You plunked him.
Yeah, that was me.
Really?
ALL RIGHT, all right! I'll call her.
Naw, I gotta wait until its just the right time.
Look I don't know.
No, it isn't. I can find out.
Is Tatiana coming?
Yeah, all right.
Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead.
Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.
I'm clean and you know it.
If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber.
Hi Cosmo.
That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.
So how was the pie?
It's not true!
I don't know how I feel about it.
Oh, this is awful.
So what? You're entitled.
Well, what happened?
Kramer there's no way you stick to this.
An inch! Can you move over an inch?!?
Let's do it.
I hear it's ah beautiful there.
(apologetically) Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.
Hello.
(muffled) There you go.
No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?
No, I told you, it's just a dry run.
Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.
(to George) She thinks it's someone named Raef.
Hey.
Do the bums ever complain? "Soup again?"
(examining the label) Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.
Ohh, will not cause drowsiness"
Ill try and remember that.
Well, that's it! Tonight's the night. I'm getting one. No "if and's or but's".
Wait a minute! (A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.)
Oh, Im sorry. Im just waiting for someone.
Oh! Oh! *Delores*!
Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you.
It.
Yeah, me too.
You're going to start your own charity?
You're not gonna get the job.
Youre wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!
Where's Babu?
Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing.
They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.
I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket)
You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?
Yeah, sleeping arrangements. So, you haven't, uh...
Mmm, succulent.
Do you not like apple pie?
Come on up.
(His thoughts) I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver.
What? All right, fine.
Can't be done, huh?
You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.
No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey)
Ah, she's with her friend Wendy.
Yeah. Where's George?
I can't, I can't take it.
I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? Thats what I want to know. I mean, its the championship, Im hitting everything.
Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.
No, I don't have any ashtrays.
What are you, crazy?!
Kramer, I want my car.
Me?
Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?
You, you cant overdry.
Your boyfriend, he's taking it out.
A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning..
How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?
Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?
Am not.
What, it...it's here in the building?
Horse manure?
Why do I seek your counsel?
Did he say anything?
I really have to go to the bathroom.
I thought we were talking about me.
Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?
Kramer?
Oh, what do you think? I found it at the back of my closet.
Oh, I didn't get the insurance.
By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.
Hey. It's you! (pointing) Th..that's my Friars Club jacket!
I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.
Uh, you know, why dont you go first, you just had a long trip.
Of course.
Okay....too bad.
You sure?
Yeah, well I don't trust this guy. I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.
Elaine is having a "houseguest." She's picking him up at the airport tonight.
Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.
Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now?
Of course I want to talk about it.
It's like this all the time.
Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!
So this is it, huh?
When are ya gettin' out?
No.
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
No I...
Why?
You're not very bright, are you?
While you were in jail. So you're free.
You dont have to say Wow. I know its Wow. (Kramer smiling) And theres that smile again. Well, what is that? (Intercom buzzes.) Its George.
I dont know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three oclock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someones door and tell them to keep it down? Youre really altering your whole self-image. I mean, what am I, Fred Mertz now? Whats happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. Theres a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh... shh... shhh... shhh... Doesnt work, cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me. Some people you cant shush in a movie theater. Theres always that certain group of people, isnt it? Theyre talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They wont shush. Theyre the unshushables.
She's seen you in this thing.
Oh Come on!!
So Marcelino's going to take down the check?
Really?
Could you at least get a hat for me?
Come on up.
Beautiful!
Come on.
Are you sure? Oh boy, here we go.
I notice you threw 'stocky' in there.
You like that commercial?
(interrupts)like a shark fisherman with a bucket of (?) Ch....
Yeah, yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. Would you mind. I'd like to take the picture back.
What is his name?
Well, I'm very mysterious by nature. (Jerry knocks on the door) A lot of women find that attractive.
Eat something! Babu...
Come on, I'll go with you.
Well, that's your ceiling.
I don't smell anything.
George?
Don't get up, please, allow me.
Yeah.
That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother.
Oh, Bruline. Newman's got the same one.
Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
Yeah.
She's pretty rough!
I can start right away.
I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. Shes going to move in.
I'm a joke maker.
She's also quite bold.
Well, ...
I'll make them later. Uh.
Svengali.
This is Jerry Seinfeld.
Oh, excuse me... Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.
I don't think I can be that nice.
First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, "Didn't you see my signal?" "Look at that fender!" ..Then you'd see a real fight.
(looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
Will everybody please leave?!
Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.
I, I love that George.
(thinking) Whats going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, shes too good to be alone. Whats the difference, I cant maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me.
Yeah. (hands racquet to Kramer) I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it.
I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.
I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.
Excuse me. (Gets up and answers the door.) Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!
It's brown.
Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.
Strike two!
Lip area.
Ah, that's a shame.
Is that the end of it?
See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.
Good shake. Perfect shake. Single pump, not too hard, you know, doesn't have to prove anything, but, you know, firm enough to know he was there.
I'm asking!
What do you mean, "kind of."?
Well, I do.
Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?
That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.
Oh, I forgot to call Christie.
Good idea. (phone's ringing, goes to it) (muttering) There's a beach towel on the rack.. (to phone) Yeah.
Please.
Yeah.
I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!
So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?
You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.
I'm gonna get that. (walks across the set towards the blue curtain)
Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio.
I see you there Ramon.
What happened to the car?
I don't need a reason to give gifts, it's my nature. I love to make people happy.
Why?
Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people.
Is this my stereo?
Kind of a Yankee prom?
Good.
Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater)
Great.
He's late already.
I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.
Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally, yeah this is Jerry,I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and..
Good, fine.
Listen, Joel, I dont think we should see each other anymore.
Knicks? Rangers?
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.
(Kramer shows Jerry and Elaine the paper) "Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research".." Government funds genetic research at area hospital" ... Yeah, so?
All right.
Ma, will you stop?
Ah..........
yeah yeah what is it with you and Tony? what are you? it's like his sidekick now?
Hey, should we say something to him?
Just keeps on getting better and better.
All right.
Just like that?
What's the matter? What's going on?
Newman?
Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...
On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?
Yes.
Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts, so he killed him.
Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, You think?
Maybe!
George is taking it.
What is that? (Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.)
Alright, I'll feel him out.
Ah, really.
1409, that's a good score.
Could you make a little more noise? (To his parents) Listen, I'm gonna have to call you later.
(pushing her) How did you get that?
N-na I'm paying for the trip.
Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.
Oh, no reason. You're into karate right?
Hi! How 'r u doing?
Yeah, it's me. Kramer found the car!
How did you know they were defective?!
So, does he like you?
I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.
He does look like a horse.
Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.
(a la "Don Corleione") Elaine, never ask me about my business!.... (SHEEPISH) "Godfather."
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?
He's not after me.
Frankly, I'm a little concerned.
Where?
Fluff and Fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.
Come on.
Witchy Woman?
Yeah.
(thinking) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume...
I don't know.
The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.
Oh no, not you too?
I thought they wanted to settle.
You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!
Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!
(Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key?
"Rust-proofing"?
Sure, we can do something next week.
You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!
What are you repeating everything I'm saying?
No,, but thank you.
Oh, no, the woods! The hole!
Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
Ah, no problem. That's fine.
Dont worry about it, it wasnt working anyway.
I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.
I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.
Of course he did ..The guy's working ya.
You mentioned the raisins.
What?
Because its complicated. Theres some tension there.
Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, is that you?
All right, I'm sorry. What about her?
Oh man...
No, I dont.
Yeah.
Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?
Come in.
I'm Seinfeld!
I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.
Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?
(Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.
Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.
I never heard her say hi.
Your pants!
No, because that's...
Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes outside)
Alright.
Yeah, I know about the three dates.
Who figures and immigrants gonna have a pony?
Look who's here! Georgie-boy!
(trying to divert Vic's attention) What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that?
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed...
We've been breaking up for 10 hours?
Awe... That's nice!
No.
"All right."
Hey look at this. What is going on here?
Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers?
When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their face, you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going with somebody.
Come on.
It was a bisque.
What happened?
That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.
Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally!
If they were fanatic about showers, they might.
Yes.
And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.
So, do the Ross's know?
[quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!
Hey, Happy Birthday.
We're four months apart.
Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?
(To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.
But that's your routine.
Were you crying? I mean, its just a grape. Youll find it.
The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..
Yeah,
I was going to say, "Being a good host."
Five o'clock.
Today, like right now.
How could you not believe me?!?
(offering a plate) Chicken?
(to speaker) Coming down.
Okay, starting...NOW!
What? Don't say that!
Wow. Look at him. The Yankee Clipper
Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida.
I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.
Give it to me!
Not as long.
Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?
(locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.
Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!
George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.
Hey, Frankie! So, where's the car?
Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.
Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both killed!
You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're lifting heavy suit cases.
What is this?
What happened?
What?
You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.
They stole my car.
..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beveridged!
No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.
Hello Milos.
That is right, somebody else was driving.
What did you do?
Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.
(to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?
You can't. That's why they lose very few players.
"I don't know but I was spitting out and rinsing like there was no tomorrow."
Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh
(to Kramer) What's this?
Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.
(looks round) Don't worry, I'll get you out.
Well, we got three bags.
Are you sure?
It does other things!
(to Kramer) I thought you stopped talking??
You know, I really... Ive come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that theyre just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you dont really wanna see them. You dont call them, they call you. You dont call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you dont really have anything in common with is to pretend youre hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend theres a little desk around you. The only problem with this is theres no way you can say, Hey, its been great having you on the show. Were out of time.
(Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?
You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.
No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!
A gun?!
Oh boy.
I don't know.
Hey, Tim. Great party.
How do you like that.
Well, we've got to do something. (grabs his phone) I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.
First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.
What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?
It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman.
Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.
Where are we?
Okay, half-hour.
What about you, George?
Well, thats it. Look, Im going to Vermont. I dont want to think about this. Im selling.
All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm away, gets phone) now... the failsafe. The wake-up guy... (dials)
We're straightening out!
Hey.
"Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable..." Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been "outed"! I wasn't even "in"!
All right, take it easy.
George what the hell are you doing over there? I told you to mind your own business now stay out of my affairs!
Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.
(Shouting) Come on up! (Opens his door for Elaine)
I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.
Extra teeth. I love that look.
Is there a box spring?
Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!
Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?
You unwittingly made a major commitment. That's a lot of pressure.
You know my parents are coming in and I got some clean up to do , so if you and Potsie are done scheming....
(to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!
I wouldn't worry about it. B-6?
Yeah, is this Sid Field's residence?
I got a date!
Oh, no, no.
Yes, I poo-poo.
So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?
Plantains?
On the couch? So you're...
It's a very complicated area.
You may have a point.
So, what did she have to say?
George is pickin' us up at the airport.
of course you would
Let's just make a run for it.
Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you?
You mean Florence Nightingale. **
Let me in, it's me. (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the dressing room) Here. You don't know what this is costing me. (hands Kramer the ticket)
(under his breath) Well, this worked out just as I had hoped.
You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!
That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen -
Really?
Well, that's garbage.
Latex? And what do I do with latex?
Yeah, I think I do.
Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.
I feel terrible. (Kramer smiling) I mean, Ive seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I cant go any further, but... Shes just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I cant breathe. Its like a drug.
Hello.
Hey, I've been back four days, I want my mail.
I never really wanted the pen.
No, people hate that.
How did you get my package?
It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.
Come in, we're taking a break.
That was Keith.
All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.
You're making a big mistake, Joe!
Its never happened to me before.
Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit.
(Stunned) No, keep it. (Elaine enters the apartment) Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.
Here.
Plane's ready.
All right, that's not bad. Now get over here!
(Stops) Alright, that's not gonna work, it's not gonna work. Let me just think for a second here.
Yeah, pretty damn good one, too!
What are you gonna do there?
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye. (Hangs up) Hey, I'm flyin' first class.
Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what are you doing?
I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?
Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!
Oh yeah? What did you talk about?
Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?
What?
That's the garbage disposal!
Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really.
Family?
Are you all right?
Yeah. It's in your closet.
Yes.
She couldn't make it.
Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.
What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.
What?
I-I'll tell 'em
(a lightbulb goes on in his head) Riverside Drive.
You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... (he spots a mailman crouched emptying a box) Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.
You got Danny Tartabull?!
I was an idiot for listening to you!
(passing Hallie) 'Scuse me.
Yeah... So's shock therapy.
Oh, well, now you're talking.
Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity. 5? 3? Oh, it was just an expression. All right, well, that's very sweet of you. Okay, I'll call you later. All right, bye. Hey!
Sex, thats meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; thats heavy. Thats like an hour.
She's got really nice hair.
Who thinks you're smart?
No, don't cancel it.
Yeah.
Sex... to save the friendship. (Elaine drops her bag, takes off her jacket and walks into Jerry's bedroom) Well, if we have to (un-tucks his shirt) we have to.
It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.
No.
Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)
Outside!
Come on up.
You?
It is not!
Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey!
We went over that.
Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.
Oh that's an old wives tale.
Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!
(leaving hurriedly) Wuhh...
Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...
Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.
It's over?
You cried?
Filks nothing, but 555-FILM is Movie Phone.
Come on.
So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?
How did they find Babu?
(answering the buzzer) Yeah?
You got evens.
Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.
So? She used the toothbrush!
Here he is... that's the guy! (rolls up window) No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!
I'm gonna go let Elaine in. (Kramer reaches out to stop him leaving)
I wonder what ever happened to her.
Hey.
I know the point.
Right in the head! (leans in and points at Testikov)
Yeah, let's just get out of here.
You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?
I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something.
Turn in?
Really?
(standing) Alright, I'll see you later.
World War I plane?
There's more food down the hall.
She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...
We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.
You know, I think he wears a piece.
"Finders fee"? It was on the lot!
Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.
Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.
okay , bye (to George) What happened , did you take it off?
It's a pig at a complain department.
It's not like she's *in* the movie.
She's the model I met on the plane.
Yes. Hes a doctor. (Elaine starts to leave. ) Wait a second. (Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in Elaines purse.) (to George) What are you doing?
Oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh that's terrific... Mulva.
That's their policy.
They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing."
People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression 'The best revenge is living well' I've said this, in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice, doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him, 'Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting, french doors, a divan. That'll show those punks.'
Okay.
Yes, I pick it up.
What's with the signs?
No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.
Let me explain something to you. You see, youre not normal. Youre a great guy, I love you, but youre a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldnt understand.
Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)
Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! (haha)
Krame? Sein. What are you doing? Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island. What are your thoughts about taking a ride? You sure? Okay, but don't leave me hanging here. Okay, great. Let me give you directions.
Really?
Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately.
I didn't know you had a motorctcle.
Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?
Your hands were in the dough?
(to the phone) Hello yeah yes it is really ah, ah Could you hold on a second? (to George and Kramer) Hey listen to this, some woman found an electronic organizer, my name was in it, she wants me to help her track down the owner.
Well, did you get the ball?
I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.
Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?
I don't know. So what's this job of yours?
Shaft.
What?
What?
So how'd you hit the car?
Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!
Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
You might have.
My grandfather gave me a statue!
Absolutely.
What's that?
Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.
I'm not sending you the bill.
Why didn't you ever mention this?
Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
All right.
(answering, quickly) If you know what happened in the Met game, dont say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, Im sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no
Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.
If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened.
Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend. (puts his arm around Elaine's shoulder, but she shrugs it off twice)
Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order)
Ah, don't worry. I made reser... (catches himself)
Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.
What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?
So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?
So it could be anyone?
Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."
So you do want it.
Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?
Maybe we should go.
Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door.
What ever happened with the shirt?
Oh, Mattingly just singled .
What?
Commando 8?
What do you need me for?
"No...Got dental appointment."
Can you blame her?
So you want to go to the party on Friday night?
How did you know?
(pressing intercom) yeah?
You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.
I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y. (he spits it into the waste bin)
Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.
Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.
All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape.
(Trying to shut him up) Kramer.
I never told you his name.
Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress.
Oy.
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.
Yes.
Get out of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The Heart Attack')
Beautiful!
No, no. Its not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, its not like Marlenes a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, weve had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling. (George nods.) And its these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if Im busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and shes in the middle of a sentence!
Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain.
Good body.
Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?
What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp, why do you want shade?
Sure.
Why? Is that what he told you?
You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?
(to Bania) Excuse me. (he goes back in the dressing room)
Where you going?
Uh Laura, George was wondering if...
So when do I meet this jerk?
I'm not letting you cheat, Newman. You're not getting anywhere near that board.
Uh, again? (Limping towards the door) I'll be right there.
(taking them) Well, what's this for?
Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.
Well, you know; not everything. I do what I can.
I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there.
(nervous) What?
I love Yoo Hoo.
Eckman? I thought he was doing time?
(coming out from the bathroom) who was it?
Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it They're roommates. She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back. She's not gonna do that.
What's with you?
Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out.
Faux pas.
It's not.
Hello.
I don't think so.
No. I don't.
You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.)
Seeya.
Mentor? You mean your boss.
Bedroom.
Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets.
Yeah!
Why?
They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.
I thought you'd like that.
Oh, no!
You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while, no matter how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because they're crawling , crawling on your skin. Up your legs , up your spine , up your back.....
You got yourself a girlfriend.
What?
Yeah?
Really? Did you talk to him?
I know that, Kramer.
Wow, look at you. So you got the job.
No I gave it back to you
It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?
Do I know you?
Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.
What community? There's a community?
I thought you didn't want the doormat.
Sure, how much?
(urgent whisper) Elaine.
What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I dont even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. Thats what I want. I want an admission of guilt.
She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.
Georgio! Nice duds!
You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!
He went back? What do you mean he went back?
Thin ice, George. Thin ice..
What is he like?
No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!
We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.
Aaa. Well ... you want something to eat, don't you?
Why?
Oh, wow.
Other drivers?
You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry?
So what are you gonna do?
Three.
Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?
Why not?
I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.
Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.
Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.
He's gonna talk into her other ear.
And you waved it away.
Yeah, yeah
So you have no control over the remote?
That's great.
I don't wanna be Switzerland.
Sure.
Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.
No, believe me it's not good. I'll mail you a new one with something really funny written on it.
I couldn't do it without you.
Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.
Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?
Elaine...
Well, whaddaya wanna do here?
It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something.
It has nothing to do with her sister.
(to Kessler) Yeah. (to the phone) Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem.
Hey look ,you know, you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here. You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me.
Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?
I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck.
we're expected to be superficial
Oh yeah? Huh.
He was in the shop. I thought you told me he wasn't going to be there.
Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for?
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese. (buys a newspaper out of a machine)
Yeah, I know.
Ar-moire.
You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?
Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to 'em. Mind if I walk through real quick?
I still don't have to go.
No! He stole my move!
Do you believe that guy?
Where ya goin'?
I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals.
Yeah, all right. All right.
Oh. that would be great.
Any luck?
No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him.
Wow! Good work, Nancy Drew
What thing?
It stinks.
That's it?
(naked, carrying a belt sander) I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.
George, Marla.
Well, what does that mean?
Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' "Where's your jock strap?" Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.
I think I saw one a coupla doors down.
What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police dont use them for, you know, crowd control. (Jerry crouches down, and makes like hes riding a pony.) Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, Im talking to you. Behind the barricades! So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldnt it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... Baltic, thats two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, thats it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.
Always helpful.
Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?
The, the meeting you blew off?
It's unheard of ...
A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guys got a coma going like this  you dont want to mess with it.
You have a girlfriend?
You know last time you had me throwin' a rye bread up three floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off your car, where does it end?!?
Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth?
...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.
If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, Im telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. Im sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.
(whispers) Haymen, Are you sure?
What?! How?
That was Elaine , she changed her mind. She's not coming over.
Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.
(picks up the headphones) That was Elaine...
Maybe we should get you to a hospital.
I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...)
So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, hes thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, theres nothing left?
Yeah, we'll do it another time.
I got the call...!
Have you said anything to her about it?
What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present)
No, I dont eat dinner. Dinners for suckers.
Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?
This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.
Oh, beautiful.
I know enough not to get on them.
But that is not what they would have you believe.
Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.
"I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery."
(continuing) No rejection, no guilt, no remorse.
I'm on the phone!
Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.
Well, Ill tell you what. Ill choose you for it. Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...thats it, you gotta win three.
Oh, it won't be for that long.
Oh, my God.
"Hey, by the way, did you ever call that guy from the health club.?"
I know.
Why?
What did you do?
I said pull over by the stop sign.
OK, see you later.
The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be?
Is this even a road?
(Looking toward beach) Oh this is interesting.
It's silly!
Hell have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Like what?
Well it's been quite a night I could sure use a cup of coffee.
I know you will.
Cmon, move up.
Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?
Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar.
I didn't know she would laugh.
Read it out loud.
About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?
I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.
I know.
Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls down, make it an eight room luxury suite.
(thoughtful) Hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey, there it is.
(before disappearing himself) Punk.
Uh huh?
Well.
You barbecuing tonight?
(muffled) Hi Wendy.
Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by the big showcase tonight.
No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage?
Oh.
All right.
(Trying to get rid of her) Yes, I think it's a fine idea. Well, good night.
Exactly.
(hurried) Great, bye.
The driver seems a little put out.
You can't take that chemist out.
You've tasted them?
I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.
Not a good sign.
(Getting up) Uncle Leo. Hello!
I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need "the clown" in his title, as clown? Bozo, "the" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...
Sort of a mooching inventory.
Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?
Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort?
Fourteen thousand.
Im takin it, Im takin the place. Im gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. Im livin here...Im movin.
So he just gets soup. He wants to save the meal. So now I got to do it all over again.
No I didn't.
Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did!
Are you taking the Tony to Sardi's?
Yeah, right.
Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened. (listens) Well, I think you should. Okay, bye.
Kramer, cockfighting is illegal.
He used to go there a lot on business.
Not fair.
Don't ask me!
Oh, oh.?
Right, just like you.
Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that?
..Alright.
Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...
Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he?
(reading on) "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-"
Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it.
We need you there!
Oh, Im sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.
Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.
Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on.
Go ahead.
So Kramer, what are you going to do?
He didn't make it.
With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.
I'M NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT!!
Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business.
Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!
Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.
Is that Joe Davola?
(To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?
(pointing Kramer) "To wit"
The dog. You're getting the dog.
I reckon.
Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your..
No. No you're not.
How about our little Elaine huh? Attended the finest finishing schools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions. Debutante balls. Look at her now. Interviewing Mohels.
And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.
(standing in the bathtub) Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.
The crepe place?
I can't give details.
Is it something I said?
Hey!!!
All set. We'll just grab the bags.
Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?
No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald cure.
See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.
Yeah, did a good job.
Really?
Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that?
He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.
(to himself) I have absolutely no idea.
(Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.
What, are you on Mercury?
What's in?
Ah, where you gonna meet a mute?
No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing. (Jerry picks up the phone and dials the number) I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?
Oh...well...
You were saying Stan? I-I'm sorry about that.
Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?
What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one.
It's softer.
Come on George.
No, no. I'll take the subway.
Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!
Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.
She's drunk out of her mind.
Hi.
O-K. You realize of course, you're naked?
Hi.
No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial.
Alright.
ca.
Looks like there is?
We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!
What's goin' on?
Alright, take 'em.
(indicates with his thumb) Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.
Yeah. I hope so ?!
What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's - it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it, and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you. (Nodding)
For what?
So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing?
Yeah.
Not that I would think of doing such things.
(Relating) Like the Batman villain?
I don't want any!
(struggling to open a bottle with his bandaged finger) I can't do it. (A LA GODFATHER) Look what they did to my boy, They massacred my boy.
I always feel bad for the silver medal winner in the Olympics. How do you live with that the rest of your life? People are gonna keep asking, "- How much did you lose by? - I don't even know...! It was like...(very fast) now.now...now.now..now..was like, like... now..now..now...! It was it...! Eh, it was it and I lost. I trained, I worked out, I exercised, I did everything, I was doing push-ups, sit-ups, I never did anything but exercise and work out for 20 years, I flew half way around the world and aaaaaaaaaah!...(showing a tiny distance between his index and thumb) And that was...it was a photo-finish! Silver...(stretching his neck forward)...gold. If I had a pimple, I would've won.
Yeah!
I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.
Did what?
Oh, come on.
What happened? Levitan?
Well, senator, Id just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it.
Who is this?
I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?
There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.
How good?
Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...
to himself Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.
"...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!"
YEAH? (speaking loudly so the visitor can hear him through the intercom)
So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.
just press it
Oh, were meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building.
Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.
Mugged?
Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?
Nothing.
I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.
Oh, because of all the singing?
So?
What?
Why what did I do?
Love that babka.
Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?
What, are you ordering food now?
Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George.
Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.
What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what they're saying.
I'm telling you man, I'm losing it.
What smell?
Ah! right...nice. Lunch with Elaine?
You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.
I- no, I dont want to go.
Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
Hey come on, you're getting it all over the floor!
I can ball park it.
No, that's Krama.
That's not a good role for you.
All I know he was sniffing.
Monday, I think.
You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand?
Well, it has nothing to do with you.
He cleared his throat?
Oh, you don't know.
And she was beautiful in that bra! I'm crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging, free wheeling attitude!
What's with you?
What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?
Oh, what are you talkin' about?
Why not you?
Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!
What are you doing here?
Yeah. So you really like this guy.
Elaine huh?.. She's completely..
I was saying 'baby' way before George!
(looking at her) How about that.
When George was growing up..
Then we'll make it the eight.
Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.
Yeah.
I don't have a paper though.
I can do that.
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you dont have to be home on time.
How come you're eating your peas one at a time?
You weren't supposed to say that.
Maybe you just didn't see him.
No, I tried it on. It fits good.
Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the sirens song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?
We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.
(Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.
Religion, my friend, thats what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that its going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.
(shouting) Kramer what am I going to do did you hear that that guy's gonna put a kibosh on me he's crazy he's out of his mind....
No.
Shut up, you old bag!
(Scared) Ah! Kramer!
You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.
Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.
How did you do those things?
I dunno, it was an impulse.
You're a lucky guy.
So the whole set was destroyed?
What you're suggesting is illegal.
Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.
George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.
Thousand.
Fine.
So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.
I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back.
All fathers are intimidating. Theyre intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, To hell with the world, I can make my own people. Ill eat whatever I want, Ill wear whatever I want, and Ill create whoever I want.
You had a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with my butler?
(dry) He knows.
Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.
Get off the phone!
Obviously never.
yeah, yeah.
Who?
(Confused) What are you talking about?
Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh...
Elaine!
Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone.
This is real believable.
Hello?
Oh, sorry.
Yeah.
Oh! No it's Sally Weaver.
How did he find out?
It doesn't?
(holding up the '# DAD' shirt) We're even.
(wiping his brow) He could use a couple laughs.
Stuff.
Oh thank you very much.
Mona a Baldo .
George? (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.
Like that (snaps his fingers)
Is it a good one?
At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.
Can you get me a soda?
They're having sex in the hotel room.
Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?
I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife fight for a citrus drink.
Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case.
(Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.
Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up)
Fine. Go.
What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?
You don't think...?
Oh. Sorry, I didnt know..
Yours or hers?
Yes, yes, I heard.
Ah, she's okay.
Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat.
(putting on his coat to go downstairs, he finds the key in his coat pocket) I believe this belongs to you.
George Peppard has been dead for years.
Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.
You, you're going now?
That was July 4th!
(to George) Hey.
That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.
Shes limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.
In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?
(Like an Army general) Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys.
We're talkin' federal crime here.
I have some idea.
(reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.
A stupid what?
The tooth brush in the toilet bowl.
They eat fish.
You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!
Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . What could he do?
(on phone) hello.
Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger.
I'm freakin' out! I am freakin' out!
Am I going? It was three nights ago.
Really?
It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?
You play a *Hell* of a piano.
Be careful.
