Kenny! There you are. Jay Shermak and Stu Crespi from NBC. Listen, Kenny. Really funny out there.
(To Jerry, laughing about one of his bits) The bit, the bit I really liked what were the parakeet flew into the mirror. Now that's funny.
(to George) Yeah I think I see it. It's like a white discoloration.
And basically, I just wanted to let you know that we've been discussing you at some of our meetings and we'd be very interested in doing something.
(to Rita) Can I tell you something in confidence? I think it's a woman.
Well, here, uh, why don't you give us a call and maybe we can develop a series.
Excuse me, Jerry? I'm Stu Chermak. I'm with NBC.
I think if you go down the hall, it's on the right at the very end.
Wait a minute, I know you. You're the guy from the Calvin Klein underwear ads.
Oh you know I don't know. I saw him in the hall this morning, I said hello to him. He walked right past me.
Now, I thought he was really good, very funny.
You know I don't know. I thought he was coming. I assumed he wouldn't miss it.
Would it be possible to get a-a-a copy of 'La Cocina'?
First of all, that was a terrific show.
So, if you have any idea for like a TV show for yourself, well, we'd just love to talk about it.
