So, if you have any idea for like a TV show for yourself, well, we'd just love to talk about it.

(To Jerry, laughing about one of his bits) The bit, the bit I really liked what were the parakeet flew into the mirror. Now that's funny.
Excuse me, Jerry? I'm Stu Chermak. I'm with NBC.
You know I don't know. I thought he was coming. I assumed he wouldn't miss it.
And basically, I just wanted to let you know that we've been discussing you at some of our meetings and we'd be very interested in doing something.
Well, here, uh, why don't you give us a call and maybe we can develop a series.
First of all, that was a terrific show.
Would it be possible to get a-a-a copy of 'La Cocina'?
Kenny! There you are. Jay Shermak and Stu Crespi from NBC. Listen, Kenny. Really funny out there.
Give us a call. We want to be in the Kenny Bania business.
(to George) Yeah I think I see it. It's like a white discoloration.
I think if you go down the hall, it's on the right at the very end.
Now, I thought he was really good, very funny.
(to Rita) Can I tell you something in confidence? I think it's a woman.
