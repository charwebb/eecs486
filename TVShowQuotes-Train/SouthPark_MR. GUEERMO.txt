Yeah! There it is! Slapped you! You probably think I'm finished, huh?!  No, there's another one!

Don't talk to me, stupid jock asshole! 

What did you say?

I slap you!

Ooo, that sounds emotional!  What is it son? What's on your mind? Whatever it is, you know your dad has the time.

You don't tell me how to raise my son! I'll slap it again. 

Awww. I'm going slap-happy!  I'm going slap, slap happy! Slappity slappin' you, teachin' you a lesson for coming in my house!  What are you looking at, Robertson? 

What?

I slap you!

I slap slap slap you!

Kids these days!  Unh unh unh! Just go right back to your room and sing a ballad, mister!

What? Who the hell's been saying that?!

What?!  What's going on here, what's this all about?  What do you think you're doing?

You are never going to play shooting hoops, do you understand?!  You are going to sing and dance and be the best at it!

You're trying to turn my son into a little asshole sports person like yourself  There, there's another slap! Maybe you'll think next time you act, you-  Slap it, I'll slap it! 

Go ahead. Make my day.  You get upstairs, or I will slap you until there's little red hand prints all over face!  Ow!  Oh my God, what was that?  Did you see that?! Oh my God it hurts so bad!  Ow. What the "H" is going on?! 

You know what this means? It means you're about to get slapped, so you'd better shut up!

That's it! I'm gonna slap you!

You'd better just turn your asses around and get back in your little car, 'cause there's a world o'hurt about to come your way!

You hear the rhythm. Now is the time, the tiiiiime. It's time to go to bed. It's time to call it a day. You can reach the stars and-

There's no singing and dancing in basketball!

Bridon! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Bupow! Bupow! Bupow!

What are you interrupting me for?!

Okay, let's eat!

I drove by the school and saw kids on the playground doing a music number and you weren't there! You're here in the sports gym shooting basket hoops!

Nono! Sing it!

Stupid-ass boy!

What did you say, woman?!

Basketball? No son of mine is going to be a sweaty little jock!

I'll do it! I'll slap the shit out of you!

Don't make me slap you!  I will slap your face so super hard...  I am the man of this house! You disrespect me and you're gonna get slapped!

Get out of my way, Mackey. You wanna piece of this?!  I'll slap everyone in this God damned school if I have to! 

Yadada yadada yadada dadadadada High School Musical is so awesome. 

Oh, by all means. You got the balls to come in here?! Do it! Do it! 

Don't you even think about it! If I had a jock for a son, I'd be the laughingstock of the men's choir club.

Don't worry, bitch, I didn't forget about you!  There's a slap for you!  Slap, slap, slap!  Yeah, there you go!  Here's a little reach around the back of the head slap!
