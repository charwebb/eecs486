Uh, text me later, Kenny, if you wanna, like, play basketball or somethin'. 
Oh my God. Oh my God, they- they killed Kenny!
Dude, I'm sorry, but we still aren't getting it. You're half man and half berry?
"In strange aeons even Death may die?" What does that mean, Human Kite?
All right, superheroes. Back to our secret base!
Dude, why would the Goth kids worship Cthulhu?
Dude, thanks for getting us out of that dark oblivion, Mint-Berry Crunch.
We know some of these people. There's Mr. Adler, from shop class. And those two geeky computer guys.
Dude, who said you could put a big siren in my parents' house?
All right, superheroes, we've got to find out more about this Necronomicon thing!
Mysterion, if Cartman's gone, why are we still calling ourselves Coon and Friends?
Look dude, we don't need to play Superhero anymore. We can just go home.
Go away Cartman. We kicked you out of Coon and Friends, remember?
We all wanna go home, Clyde. I don't think we're gonna last very long out here.
We all fight crime together. How come we're just your "friends"?
Well then, perhaps we should return to our secret base and bake some more!
"It is used by cults around the world, most notably the Cult of Cthulhu."
...Nah, see, that's the problem dude, that's not really a superpower. Like, I have mental command over all power tools, Human Kite can fly-
Dude, you're freaking out Mint-Berry Crunch. He's peed his pants. 
There's more important things to discuss right now!
And shoot lasers out of his eyes. And Mysterion can...  Wait, what's your superpower Mysterion?
...Ah I think we would remember you dying, dude.
How do we get pictures of him naked with Courtney Love?
Let him go, dude, or else we'll totally tell our parents on you!
...Oh yeah, good one. Mysterion can't die, and Iron Maiden is indestructible-
Wow, can you believe it Kenny? Bradley actually had superpowers. Isn't that cool?
Dude, Kenny, what'd you run away for?! We've gotta fight these guys!
