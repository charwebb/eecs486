Dude, I'm sorry, but we still aren't getting it. You're half man and half berry?
Dude, why would the Goth kids worship Cthulhu?
Dude, you're freaking out Mint-Berry Crunch. He's peed his pants. 
...Nah, see, that's the problem dude, that's not really a superpower. Like, I have mental command over all power tools, Human Kite can fly-
"It is used by cults around the world, most notably the Cult of Cthulhu."
Oh my God. Oh my God, they- they killed Kenny!
Uh, text me later, Kenny, if you wanna, like, play basketball or somethin'. 
We know some of these people. There's Mr. Adler, from shop class. And those two geeky computer guys.
Look dude, we don't need to play Superhero anymore. We can just go home.
Dude, thanks for getting us out of that dark oblivion, Mint-Berry Crunch.
There's more important things to discuss right now!
Mysterion, if Cartman's gone, why are we still calling ourselves Coon and Friends?
We all fight crime together. How come we're just your "friends"?
Why do we have to be called "Coon and Friends"?
All right, superheroes. Back to our secret base!
How do we get pictures of him naked with Courtney Love?
Let him go, dude, or else we'll totally tell our parents on you!
...Ah I think we would remember you dying, dude.
All right, superheroes, we've got to find out more about this Necronomicon thing!
Mosquito has a good plan, Cartman! Hear him out!
Wow, can you believe it Kenny? Bradley actually had superpowers. Isn't that cool?
We all wanna go home, Clyde. I don't think we're gonna last very long out here.
Dude, who said you could put a big siren in my parents' house?
"In strange aeons even Death may die?" What does that mean, Human Kite?
Go away Cartman. We kicked you out of Coon and Friends, remember?
Well then, perhaps we should return to our secret base and bake some more!
And shoot lasers out of his eyes. And Mysterion can...  Wait, what's your superpower Mysterion?
