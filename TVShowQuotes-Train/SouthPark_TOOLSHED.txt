Toolshed!

Oh my God! Kenny!

...Ah I think we would remember you dying, dude.

Dude, why would the Goth kids worship Cthulhu?

Oh Jesus...

Dude, thanks for getting us out of that dark oblivion, Mint-Berry Crunch.

How, dude?

Uh-what?

Dude, you're freaking out Mint-Berry Crunch. He's peed his pants. 

Ya got poop, don't ya?

We all wanna go home, Clyde. I don't think we're gonna last very long out here.

Oh my God! Holy shit dude!

...Oh yeah, good one. Mysterion can't die, and Iron Maiden is indestructible-

And shoot lasers out of his eyes. And Mysterion can...  Wait, what's your superpower Mysterion?

Mosquito has a good plan, Cartman! Hear him out!

"It is used by cults around the world, most notably the Cult of Cthulhu."

Kenny Kenny, calm down.

The Necronomicon?

Wow, can you believe it Kenny? Bradley actually had superpowers. Isn't that cool?

To the grocery store!

Why do we have to be called "Coon and Friends"?

Go away Cartman. We kicked you out of Coon and Friends, remember?

Oh my God. Oh my God, they- they killed Kenny!

We all fight crime together. How come we're just your "friends"?

...Woo-hat?

We all voted, it was unanimous.

Aw, dude, it's Captain Hindsight.

Mysterion, if Cartman's gone, why are we still calling ourselves Coon and Friends?

Dude, I'm sorry, but we still aren't getting it. You're half man and half berry?

Toolshed!

Dude, where the fuck are we?

There's more important things to discuss right now!

All right, superheroes. Back to our secret base!

How do we get pictures of him naked with Courtney Love?

Uh, text me later, Kenny, if you wanna, like, play basketball or somethin'. 

Let him go, dude, or else we'll totally tell our parents on you!

"In strange aeons even Death may die?" What does that mean, Human Kite?

Oh shit!

Look dude, we don't need to play Superhero anymore. We can just go home.

Dude, Kenny, what'd you run away for?! We've gotta fight these guys!

Kenny? No! No!

Dude, who said you could put a big siren in my parents' house?

Oh my God! Holy shit, dude!

Um dude, are you okay?
