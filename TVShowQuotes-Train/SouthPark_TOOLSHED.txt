We all fight crime together. How come we're just your "friends"?

Wow, can you believe it Kenny? Bradley actually had superpowers. Isn't that cool?

...Woo-hat?

To the grocery store!

Dude, I'm sorry, but we still aren't getting it. You're half man and half berry?

Dude, Kenny, what'd you run away for?! We've gotta fight these guys!

Why do we have to be called "Coon and Friends"?

Dude, you're freaking out Mint-Berry Crunch. He's peed his pants. 

...Ah I think we would remember you dying, dude.

Kenny Kenny, calm down.

Toolshed!

Oh my God. Oh my God, they- they killed Kenny!

There's more important things to discuss right now!

Uh, text me later, Kenny, if you wanna, like, play basketball or somethin'. 

Dude, thanks for getting us out of that dark oblivion, Mint-Berry Crunch.

Oh my God! Holy shit dude!

And shoot lasers out of his eyes. And Mysterion can...  Wait, what's your superpower Mysterion?

Go away Cartman. We kicked you out of Coon and Friends, remember?

Oh shit!

Let him go, dude, or else we'll totally tell our parents on you!

Kenny? No! No!

Oh my God! Holy shit, dude!

"It is used by cults around the world, most notably the Cult of Cthulhu."

Toolshed!

We all voted, it was unanimous.

We know some of these people. There's Mr. Adler, from shop class. And those two geeky computer guys.

All right, superheroes. Back to our secret base!

Mosquito has a good plan, Cartman! Hear him out!

"In strange aeons even Death may die?" What does that mean, Human Kite?

How, dude?

...Oh yeah, good one. Mysterion can't die, and Iron Maiden is indestructible-

Ya got poop, don't ya?

Look dude, we don't need to play Superhero anymore. We can just go home.

Um dude, are you okay?

How do we get pictures of him naked with Courtney Love?

Oh my God! Kenny!

Aw, dude, it's Captain Hindsight.

...Nah, see, that's the problem dude, that's not really a superpower. Like, I have mental command over all power tools, Human Kite can fly-

Dude, why would the Goth kids worship Cthulhu?

Mysterion, if Cartman's gone, why are we still calling ourselves Coon and Friends?

Uh-what?

Dude, where the fuck are we?

Oh Jesus...

The Necronomicon?
