Well then, it looks like I'm gonna have to go out shopping again. 

Look, Satan is a very important person to me. And I know he's an important person to you, too. So don't you think it's best for us to just... try and get along? I realize that some things about me bother you. So I'd like to hear what those things are so that I can work on them.

Well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description, stupid!

...Do you still love him?

Oh, thank you.

What?!

Well, come on, honey, I guess we should start packing up our things as well.

No, Linda! I don't want that lifestyle! It's just kind of an addiction. I want help. And I'm going to get help. Please, just give me a chance to make this all up to you.  We can have a normal life!

So you see, there was no "Some Puerto Rican Guy." He doesn't exist. And so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the Ramseys, Congressman Condit, and O.J. We gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you and, we're sorry. Now we're just happy we won't have to live a life of secrets. For I knew that even though some of you supported us, some others were looking at me and thinking, "You're a liar! You're a LIAR!"  "You know somethin' that you're not telling us, you slimy, scumbag liar!"  Eh you know, that's what people would say to me. And then people would see my wife at the supermarket and they would say, "Hello," but they'd be thinking, "Ah, there goes that MURDERER!"  "You got away with MURDER you murdering, lying, waste of life!"  And to me, people might say things like,  "LIAR! Tell us what you know you God-damned liar!"  And so, to both of us, people all over town would be saying things like,  "You know God-damn well what happened to your kid, so stop acting like victims, and confess, you MURDERING MURDERERS!"  "CONFESS!"  "LIAR! CONFESS!"  You know, and, that's what people would be saying to us, and so, we just had to come forward and tell the truth.

Ugh! You'd better believe you won't, buster!

Well somebody tipped off the CIA. I don't know how much they know, but security has been heightened.

Come on, Satan. We're all adults here. He was an important person in your life, for better or for worse. So, I wanna know him. If he sees that I'ma real person too, then... well, maybe he'll see how happy we are together.

This can't be happening! This is a bad dream.

What's the matter?

Well, looks like we're gonna have to do somethin' extra-special for Mommy and Daddy's anniversary this year. How about on Saturday we all go have dinner at Bennigan's!

Yes, it, it sure is.

Well, if you two will excuse me, I need to go and buy a certain special lady her anniversary present. Linda: I hope he means me, haha. Butters: Don't be silly, Mom. Of course he means you.

I'll be back in a little bit.  Butters, you're in charge of the house.

Sure there is!

Come on, let's go. 

What?

Oh. 

Goodnight 

I'll do that. Have fun, boys. 

I understand, comrade.

Fine. 

Satan, what the heck is wrong with you?

He sure did!

WHAT?!

Well, thank you very much, kind heroes.

Now we don't really have a choice, do we?!

Son, I wanted to talk to you about lying.

Ow..! 

Oh God! Aaah! Ohhh!

Now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant the respect they deserve. Right?

Oh, I know he's got the whole bad-boy thing going. But I think that's what you were attracted to. But I can be a pretty rough tumbler myself.  Oops!  Aw, butternuts! 

And she's... a... girl, right?

L-look, Saddam, I know that you and Satan had a relationship  And I just want you to know  that I'm totally okay with you guys staying friends.

Butters! Right now!

Uuh, no, but there's still some boxes coming from the movers.

That's right, let's get these terrorists to their rooms.  But first,  maybe we can grab some burgers.

Hey, it's alright. All that matters is that I'm back, and we're together forever. Right?

Yeah?

Do you have what it takes to join the Border Patrol? Border Patrol officers are looking for volunteers to help with the reverse immigration crisis.

Butters? Eric? Come on! We gotta get to the powder! 

It's okay of you do.

It sure it. 

Nooo! Agh! 

We're all grown men here, Satan. I wanna just go meet this guy.

I still feel secure and safe with you.

Oh, son, can you ever forgive us?

Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't like me very much.

Yeah, but why did you decide to sponsor a NASCAR driver?

I'm just... I'm just trying to be a little more naughty in bed. I uh... I know that's what you like about sex with Saddam. I'm just... showin' you that I can be that way, too.

Just kidding.  Oh, I wonder what it is.

Uh huh.

Well, it's... just that you've washed that same dish seven times now, silly.

Mr. Cartman, congratulations, the theme park is yours. 

Is that the movers, Satan?

Hey look, this trailer goes right into a building. 

Satan. Can we go for a walk in the park?

Now you're starting to hurt my feelings.

Well, what more do you want from me?

And we were thinking, since they've all become such close friends, how great it would be for us to all go together to Aspen for a ski weekend.

Well, sorry isn't gonna make it this time, mister! You know, your grandmother saw the show and had a mild stroke!

Staples. They went to the video Staples. Where's that, Jimmy?

Oh, hello, Randy, Sharon.

Yes, it sure can be.  But, there are also times when distorting the truth a little, uh, is appropriate. These are called "little white lies."

The bomb won't make it to Boston now! With the heightened security, it's only a matter of time before they find it!

Hey, don't forget that I'm covering for you! 

It just... it started as some curiosity on the Internet. I would chat with other married guys in the chat rooms and... Well the things they would talk about, Linda, I, I don't know why I found it exciting. I just did, and it, and it grew from there and it spun out of control, and- eh, ugh, DAMN YOU, INTERNET!

I've been wanting to stop going to those places, Linda, but I couldn't. I still love you!

Us? Your family's all be the shifty-eyed ones!

Dumbass!

Well it appears that all the other drivers have crashed and only the Vagisil car remains. Looks like you're going to win, Mr. Hamill.

Yes, the other drivers are not going to be happy about this. What do you think, Mr. Hamill?

Nice to meet you, Saddam! Have a safe walk back!

But it turns you on.

What? What's wrong? I said it's okay.

You see, I've been deceiving my wife for several months. I was going to gay movies and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers.

I know. I'm swamped. I've got no help here!

Come here, son.  I wanna have a talk with you.

Well, I called Saddam Hussein and invited him over for dinner tonight.

I'll say!

Oh no.  No! No, no, Jesus! Linda, what were you thinking?

Do you have a couple of minutes to go for a walk?

We'll meet you boys on the slopes. 

Linda, I know this is very hard-

Not now, Butters!

Come on, Satan. You know you can tell me anything. What's up?

Satan, we're not in junior high school anymore.

Well, I guess this means the enemy is in our own backyard, so to speak.

Butters,  look what we have for you to watch: The Lord of the Rings.

Yeah. It's me.

Mr. Mackey, we've done everything we can to raise compassionate children. We don't know where else to turn.

I thought you... killed him.

Butters?

So Saddam. Satan told me all about how you guys almost took over the world once.

You have?

My lies may have been deceitful, but your lies cover up something much more horrible than anything I ever did! 

But, that isn't all we have to say. You see, we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us.

Why sure, Butters. I was just about to get some breakfast. 

Butters, you need... to leave here right now! You need to... get out of here, egeh... Go home and wait for me to talk to talk to you.

Well all right! Good for you, Butters!

You... were out all night.

Butters! Oh Butters! Could you come and see me in my study real quick?

Oh, well, tell them I'm leavin' their check on the counter. 

No! Linda, we-

You see, sometimes telling a little white lie is okay. Like, for instance, when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house.

Oh that troublemaking son of ours! Butters! Butters, you get back here or you are grounded, mister!

Satan!  'Scuse me. Excuse me.

No, you see, Linda and I found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in Aspen if you attend a time-share presentation..

They know about the bomb!

Those were some great pork chops, Satan.

Oh, Jesus, no. OH, what have I done?

It won't? Oh, good.

Oh.  Woww!  I wasn't ready for that.

No! You have to say that a Puerto Rican man dropped you off! 

There you are.

Butters? Answer me!

Butters, the point is that, I think that if you told Mommy what Daddy was doing tonight, well, she might go completely insane.

The video stockyard.

Are you almost ready to set off the bomb?

Hello everyone. Have any of you seen our son?

I've been lookin' all over for you. I have to tell you somethin' that might make you... a little mad.

And now, if you'll excuse us, this family has to get to Bennigan's.

Alright, thanks, Chris. Is the weather going to turn su- 

Yes, I'd I sure hope we do.

Yeah.  That's hot.  You take it!  You take it now!

Hey, you.  You've been actin' strange all night. What's up?

Come on Jimmy, we don't have a lot of time.

It's okay. It's okay. I, uh, I, I understand. ...I do.

Yeah, but Dad, why would you invite an ex-girlfriend to dinner?

Oh, well I, I actually slipped down an escalator, in a mall. Those things can be pretty sketchy.

Agghhh!

Yeah...

Whoa-ho-ho, let, let me try.  Butters?  Butters, this is your father.

I just think we all need to get this out in the open.

Satan. You know you're not a very good liar. You went and saw Saddam, didn't you?

Shut your mouth, Butters! You'll speak when spoken to!

I love you, Satan.

You... what?

Well, our son was ab-ducted. We don't know that he's dead yet.

Son! I don't believe it! 

I think it's important to stay friends with people you've had relationships with.  And I know that Satan and my relationship is strong enough that it can handle anything.  Right?  Right.

Yeah. Sure. Okay.

Yeah, the Mongolians were right. Yeah.

Backdoor Sluts 9 makes Crotch Capers 3 look like Naughty Nurses 2!

No, I just want you to go for a quick walk with me. Please?

What's gotten into them?

We... have an announcement to make, um. Our son has been returned to us. 

Satan, I understand.

Yeah. Just real quick. Around the park or somethin'.

Oh, hello boys.

I'll be back in a little while. 

Oh, is it someone's anniversary soon? 

Aagghh! 

Hey, you.

But what?

Satan, I'm a '90s man. I cry when I need to. I share my feelings and I keep my mind open about everything.

No-huih, no, Butters. Oh, son, why...  Oh... Uh, we're gonna need you to tell a little white lie about where you've been though, alright?

Wait a minute. Where's Butters?

Well, come on in. Dinner's just about ready.

Yeah, well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?

Well, you know what I think we should do? I think we should all get together and just talk, like adults.

Okay. I love you, Satan.

Where are Butters and Eric?

Oh, but you are noble heroes. We know our thanks is enough. 

You bet, son. But Mommy and Daddy have something they have to do first. 

Linda?? What are you doing?? 

Okay. 

Butters!

Well, honey, you've painted the entire house. Three times.

Excitement and revelry at South Park as a little boy has just made the General Tso's chicken joke for the one millionth time. 

OOH! BUTTERS!
