Well, looks like we're gonna have to do somethin' extra-special for Mommy and Daddy's anniversary this year. How about on Saturday we all go have dinner at Bennigan's!
It just... it started as some curiosity on the Internet. I would chat with other married guys in the chat rooms and... Well the things they would talk about, Linda, I, I don't know why I found it exciting. I just did, and it, and it grew from there and it spun out of control, and- eh, ugh, DAMN YOU, INTERNET!
Well, if you two will excuse me, I need to go and buy a certain special lady her anniversary present. Linda: I hope he means me, haha. Butters: Don't be silly, Mom. Of course he means you.
Come here, son.  I wanna have a talk with you.
Come on, Satan. We're all adults here. He was an important person in your life, for better or for worse. So, I wanna know him. If he sees that I'ma real person too, then... well, maybe he'll see how happy we are together.
We... have an announcement to make, um. Our son has been returned to us. 
Yes! And all we have to do is attend a thirty-minute meeting!
Well somebody tipped off the CIA. I don't know how much they know, but security has been heightened.
Well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description, stupid!
Alright, thanks, Chris. Is the weather going to turn su- 
Excitement and revelry at South Park as a little boy has just made the General Tso's chicken joke for the one millionth time. 
Linda, Butters is gone.  Oh Christ, if Butters is gone, then... there's nothing we can do about that. But I won't let you go to jail, I promise, Linda! Pleeease! 
Well, come on, honey, I guess we should start packing up our things as well.
Satan. Can we go for a walk in the park?
I know. I'm swamped. I've got no help here!
Hey, it's alright. All that matters is that I'm back, and we're together forever. Right?
And we were thinking, since they've all become such close friends, how great it would be for us to all go together to Aspen for a ski weekend.
Butters, the point is that, I think that if you told Mommy what Daddy was doing tonight, well, she might go completely insane.
Oh, well I, I actually slipped down an escalator, in a mall. Those things can be pretty sketchy.
Well, I guess this means the enemy is in our own backyard, so to speak.
I just think we all need to get this out in the open.
Hoof. Well, I don't know about you guys, but all that ginger made me tired.
My lies may have been deceitful, but your lies cover up something much more horrible than anything I ever did! 
Uuh, no, but there's still some boxes coming from the movers.
Well, I called Saddam Hussein and invited him over for dinner tonight.
Well, honey, you've painted the entire house. Three times.
L-look, Saddam, I know that you and Satan had a relationship  And I just want you to know  that I'm totally okay with you guys staying friends.
Son, I wanted to talk to you about lying.
Hey, don't forget that I'm covering for you! 
No, I just want you to go for a quick walk with me. Please?
Well, it's... just that you've washed that same dish seven times now, silly.
Butters, you need... to leave here right now! You need to... get out of here, egeh... Go home and wait for me to talk to talk to you.
Oooo, little crime stoppers, huh? Well, I'm afraid I don't have any crimes I need solved right now.
Well it appears that all the other drivers have crashed and only the Vagisil car remains. Looks like you're going to win, Mr. Hamill.
I still feel secure and safe with you.
Yeah.  That's hot.  You take it!  You take it now!
Butters! Oh Butters! Could you come and see me in my study real quick?
No! You have to say that a Puerto Rican man dropped you off! 
Satan, we're not in junior high school anymore.
I'm just... I'm just trying to be a little more naughty in bed. I uh... I know that's what you like about sex with Saddam. I'm just... showin' you that I can be that way, too.
Look, Satan is a very important person to me. And I know he's an important person to you, too. So don't you think it's best for us to just... try and get along? I realize that some things about me bother you. So I'd like to hear what those things are so that I can work on them.
Well then, it looks like I'm gonna have to go out shopping again. 
Oh, but you are noble heroes. We know our thanks is enough. 
Oh, Jesus, no. OH, what have I done?
That's right, let's get these terrorists to their rooms.  But first,  maybe we can grab some burgers.
Hey look, this trailer goes right into a building. 
I've been lookin' all over for you. I have to tell you somethin' that might make you... a little mad.
Nice to meet you, Saddam! Have a safe walk back!
We know, but... he hasn't been home since last night. The police have been looking everywhere, but...  Well, thank you. Uh, please, let us know if you find out anything. 
Yeah. Just real quick. Around the park or somethin'.
Naw, Linda! Because you can't now say that the abductor is Costa Rican!  You have to learn to keep it straight!
Come on Jimmy, we don't have a lot of time.
I think it's important to stay friends with people you've had relationships with.  And I know that Satan and my relationship is strong enough that it can handle anything.  Right?  Right.
Oh no.  No! No, no, Jesus! Linda, what were you thinking?
Satan, what the heck is wrong with you?
So you see, there was no "Some Puerto Rican Guy." He doesn't exist. And so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the Ramseys, Congressman Condit, and O.J. We gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you and, we're sorry. Now we're just happy we won't have to live a life of secrets. For I knew that even though some of you supported us, some others were looking at me and thinking, "You're a liar! You're a LIAR!"  "You know somethin' that you're not telling us, you slimy, scumbag liar!"  Eh you know, that's what people would say to me. And then people would see my wife at the supermarket and they would say, "Hello," but they'd be thinking, "Ah, there goes that MURDERER!"  "You got away with MURDER you murdering, lying, waste of life!"  And to me, people might say things like,  "LIAR! Tell us what you know you God-damned liar!"  And so, to both of us, people all over town would be saying things like,  "You know God-damn well what happened to your kid, so stop acting like victims, and confess, you MURDERING MURDERERS!"  "CONFESS!"  "LIAR! CONFESS!"  You know, and, that's what people would be saying to us, and so, we just had to come forward and tell the truth.
Butters,  look what we have for you to watch: The Lord of the Rings.
Mr. Cartman, congratulations, the theme park is yours. 
So Saddam. Satan told me all about how you guys almost took over the world once.
It's okay. It's okay. I, uh, I, I understand. ...I do.
Backdoor Sluts 9 makes Crotch Capers 3 look like Naughty Nurses 2!
Hey, you.  You've been actin' strange all night. What's up?
This can't be happening! This is a bad dream.
Butters, where is the movie you were watching?
No, Linda! I don't want that lifestyle! It's just kind of an addiction. I want help. And I'm going to get help. Please, just give me a chance to make this all up to you.  We can have a normal life!
The bomb won't make it to Boston now! With the heightened security, it's only a matter of time before they find it!
Well, our son was ab-ducted. We don't know that he's dead yet.
You see, sometimes telling a little white lie is okay. Like, for instance, when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house.
Well, sorry isn't gonna make it this time, mister! You know, your grandmother saw the show and had a mild stroke!
And now, if you'll excuse us, this family has to get to Bennigan's.
Butters? Eric? Come on! We gotta get to the powder! 
Us? Your family's all be the shifty-eyed ones!
You bet, son. But Mommy and Daddy have something they have to do first. 
Satan. You know you're not a very good liar. You went and saw Saddam, didn't you?
Yes, it sure can be.  But, there are also times when distorting the truth a little, uh, is appropriate. These are called "little white lies."
Yeah, but why did you decide to sponsor a NASCAR driver?
Mr. Mackey, we've done everything we can to raise compassionate children. We don't know where else to turn.
Say Butters, m-I'm havin' real trouble finding an anniversary present for Mom. Any ideas?
Well, come on in. Dinner's just about ready.
Yeah, but Dad, why would you invite an ex-girlfriend to dinner?
Are you almost ready to set off the bomb?
Why sure, Butters. I was just about to get some breakfast. 
Now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant the respect they deserve. Right?
Satan, I'm a '90s man. I cry when I need to. I share my feelings and I keep my mind open about everything.
No-huih, no, Butters. Oh, son, why...  Oh... Uh, we're gonna need you to tell a little white lie about where you've been though, alright?
Oh that troublemaking son of ours! Butters! Butters, you get back here or you are grounded, mister!
No, you see, Linda and I found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in Aspen if you attend a time-share presentation..
Oh, I know he's got the whole bad-boy thing going. But I think that's what you were attracted to. But I can be a pretty rough tumbler myself.  Oops!  Aw, butternuts! 
Yeah, well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?
Come on, Satan. You know you can tell me anything. What's up?
Well, you know what I think we should do? I think we should all get together and just talk, like adults.
Whoa-ho-ho, let, let me try.  Butters?  Butters, this is your father.
Just kidding.  Oh, I wonder what it is.
Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't like me very much.
Hello everyone. Have any of you seen our son?
Do you have a couple of minutes to go for a walk?
We're all grown men here, Satan. I wanna just go meet this guy.
But, that isn't all we have to say. You see, we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us.
Staples. They went to the video Staples. Where's that, Jimmy?
Oh, well, tell them I'm leavin' their check on the counter.
