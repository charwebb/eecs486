The new waiter is useless. And, I think he's high.

Hey, don't forget that I'm covering for you! 

Yes! And all we have to do is attend a thirty-minute meeting!

Well, honey, you've painted the entire house. Three times.

Hoof. Well, I don't know about you guys, but all that ginger made me tired.

Oh, but you are noble heroes. We know our thanks is enough. 

The bomb won't make it to Boston now! With the heightened security, it's only a matter of time before they find it!

Alright, thanks, Chris. Is the weather going to turn su- 

But, that isn't all we have to say. You see, we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us.

No, you see, Linda and I found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in Aspen if you attend a time-share presentation..

Yeah, but why did you decide to sponsor a NASCAR driver?

That's right, let's get these terrorists to their rooms.  But first,  maybe we can grab some burgers.

Well somebody tipped off the CIA. I don't know how much they know, but security has been heightened.

Butters,  look what we have for you to watch: The Lord of the Rings.

Yeah, well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?

Nice to meet you, Saddam! Have a safe walk back!

We know, but... he hasn't been home since last night. The police have been looking everywhere, but...  Well, thank you. Uh, please, let us know if you find out anything. 

Shut your mouth, Butters! You'll speak when spoken to!

Satan, we're not in junior high school anymore.

Yes, the other drivers are not going to be happy about this. What do you think, Mr. Hamill?

Well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description, stupid!

I'm just... I'm just trying to be a little more naughty in bed. I uh... I know that's what you like about sex with Saddam. I'm just... showin' you that I can be that way, too.

Oh, I know he's got the whole bad-boy thing going. But I think that's what you were attracted to. But I can be a pretty rough tumbler myself.  Oops!  Aw, butternuts! 

Well, I called Saddam Hussein and invited him over for dinner tonight.

Butters, where is the movie you were watching?

We... have an announcement to make, um. Our son has been returned to us. 

Oh, Jesus, no. OH, what have I done?

I know. I'm swamped. I've got no help here!

Whoa-ho-ho, let, let me try.  Butters?  Butters, this is your father.

Butters, you need... to leave here right now! You need to... get out of here, egeh... Go home and wait for me to talk to talk to you.

Now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant the respect they deserve. Right?

Well, looks like we're gonna have to do somethin' extra-special for Mommy and Daddy's anniversary this year. How about on Saturday we all go have dinner at Bennigan's!

Now we don't really have a choice, do we?!

So you see, there was no "Some Puerto Rican Guy." He doesn't exist. And so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the Ramseys, Congressman Condit, and O.J. We gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you and, we're sorry. Now we're just happy we won't have to live a life of secrets. For I knew that even though some of you supported us, some others were looking at me and thinking, "You're a liar! You're a LIAR!"  "You know somethin' that you're not telling us, you slimy, scumbag liar!"  Eh you know, that's what people would say to me. And then people would see my wife at the supermarket and they would say, "Hello," but they'd be thinking, "Ah, there goes that MURDERER!"  "You got away with MURDER you murdering, lying, waste of life!"  And to me, people might say things like,  "LIAR! Tell us what you know you God-damned liar!"  And so, to both of us, people all over town would be saying things like,  "You know God-damn well what happened to your kid, so stop acting like victims, and confess, you MURDERING MURDERERS!"  "CONFESS!"  "LIAR! CONFESS!"  You know, and, that's what people would be saying to us, and so, we just had to come forward and tell the truth.

Oh no.  No! No, no, Jesus! Linda, what were you thinking?

It's okay. It's okay. I, uh, I, I understand. ...I do.

Well, if you two will excuse me, I need to go and buy a certain special lady her anniversary present. Linda: I hope he means me, haha. Butters: Don't be silly, Mom. Of course he means you.

I'll be back in a little bit.  Butters, you're in charge of the house.

Come here, son.  I wanna have a talk with you.

Why sure, Butters. I was just about to get some breakfast. 

Come on Jimmy, we don't have a lot of time.

No, Linda! I don't want that lifestyle! It's just kind of an addiction. I want help. And I'm going to get help. Please, just give me a chance to make this all up to you.  We can have a normal life!

Oooo, little crime stoppers, huh? Well, I'm afraid I don't have any crimes I need solved right now.

Yes, it sure can be.  But, there are also times when distorting the truth a little, uh, is appropriate. These are called "little white lies."

Well then, it looks like I'm gonna have to go out shopping again. 

I've been lookin' all over for you. I have to tell you somethin' that might make you... a little mad.

Backdoor Sluts 9 makes Crotch Capers 3 look like Naughty Nurses 2!

Yeah. Just real quick. Around the park or somethin'.

No word yet, Tom, but it could be over the embarrassment of the boob job scar video we showed just, just now. Uh, even though the timing doesn't quite work out.

Oh that troublemaking son of ours! Butters! Butters, you get back here or you are grounded, mister!

Satan. You know you're not a very good liar. You went and saw Saddam, didn't you?

I've been wanting to stop going to those places, Linda, but I couldn't. I still love you!

Well, our son was ab-ducted. We don't know that he's dead yet.

Hey, you.  You've been actin' strange all night. What's up?

Hey look, this trailer goes right into a building. 

Yeah.  That's hot.  You take it!  You take it now!

We're all grown men here, Satan. I wanna just go meet this guy.

Well, it's... just that you've washed that same dish seven times now, silly.

Hey, it's alright. All that matters is that I'm back, and we're together forever. Right?

Well it appears that all the other drivers have crashed and only the Vagisil car remains. Looks like you're going to win, Mr. Hamill.

Butters? Eric? Come on! We gotta get to the powder! 

Do you have what it takes to join the Border Patrol? Border Patrol officers are looking for volunteers to help with the reverse immigration crisis.

My lies may have been deceitful, but your lies cover up something much more horrible than anything I ever did! 

And now, if you'll excuse us, this family has to get to Bennigan's.

Naw, Linda! Because you can't now say that the abductor is Costa Rican!  You have to learn to keep it straight!

Uh huh. Yeah. You like that, don't you, bitch?  I'm a bad boy. Yeah. Take that.

No, I just want you to go for a quick walk with me. Please?

Come on, Satan. We're all adults here. He was an important person in your life, for better or for worse. So, I wanna know him. If he sees that I'ma real person too, then... well, maybe he'll see how happy we are together.

This can't be happening! This is a bad dream.

You see, I've been deceiving my wife for several months. I was going to gay movies and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers.

Son, I wanted to talk to you about lying.

I still feel secure and safe with you.

No! You have to say that a Puerto Rican man dropped you off! 

Well, come on, honey, I guess we should start packing up our things as well.

Excitement and revelry at South Park as a little boy has just made the General Tso's chicken joke for the one millionth time. 

Well, I guess this means the enemy is in our own backyard, so to speak.

Linda, Butters is gone.  Oh Christ, if Butters is gone, then... there's nothing we can do about that. But I won't let you go to jail, I promise, Linda! Pleeease! 

You see, sometimes telling a little white lie is okay. Like, for instance, when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house.

Staples. They went to the video Staples. Where's that, Jimmy?

Yeah, but Dad, why would you invite an ex-girlfriend to dinner?

Oh, well I, I actually slipped down an escalator, in a mall. Those things can be pretty sketchy.

Mr. Cartman, congratulations, the theme park is yours. 

Butters, the point is that, I think that if you told Mommy what Daddy was doing tonight, well, she might go completely insane.

Oh, well, tell them I'm leavin' their check on the counter. 

Uuh, no, but there's still some boxes coming from the movers.

It just... it started as some curiosity on the Internet. I would chat with other married guys in the chat rooms and... Well the things they would talk about, Linda, I, I don't know why I found it exciting. I just did, and it, and it grew from there and it spun out of control, and- eh, ugh, DAMN YOU, INTERNET!

Us? Your family's all be the shifty-eyed ones!

Satan. Can we go for a walk in the park?

Say Butters, m-I'm havin' real trouble finding an anniversary present for Mom. Any ideas?

You bet, son. But Mommy and Daddy have something they have to do first. 

Look, Satan is a very important person to me. And I know he's an important person to you, too. So don't you think it's best for us to just... try and get along? I realize that some things about me bother you. So I'd like to hear what those things are so that I can work on them.

Butters! Oh Butters! Could you come and see me in my study real quick?

Well, come on in. Dinner's just about ready.

Mr. Mackey, we've done everything we can to raise compassionate children. We don't know where else to turn.

Well, you know what I think we should do? I think we should all get together and just talk, like adults.

Come on, Satan. You know you can tell me anything. What's up?

Are you almost ready to set off the bomb?

No-huih, no, Butters. Oh, son, why...  Oh... Uh, we're gonna need you to tell a little white lie about where you've been though, alright?

Well, what more do you want from me?

Just kidding.  Oh, I wonder what it is.
