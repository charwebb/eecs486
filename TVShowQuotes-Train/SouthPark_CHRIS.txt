Oh, I know he's got the whole bad-boy thing going. But I think that's what you were attracted to. But I can be a pretty rough tumbler myself.  Oops!  Aw, butternuts! 
Well, sorry isn't gonna make it this time, mister! You know, your grandmother saw the show and had a mild stroke!
Mr. Mackey, we've done everything we can to raise compassionate children. We don't know where else to turn.
Satan. Can we go for a walk in the park?
That's right, let's get these terrorists to their rooms.  But first,  maybe we can grab some burgers.
But, that isn't all we have to say. You see, we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us.
And now, if you'll excuse us, this family has to get to Bennigan's.
Excitement and revelry at South Park as a little boy has just made the General Tso's chicken joke for the one millionth time. 
Shut your mouth, Butters! You'll speak when spoken to!
Uuh, no, but there's still some boxes coming from the movers.
Come on, Satan. You know you can tell me anything. What's up?
I've been wanting to stop going to those places, Linda, but I couldn't. I still love you!
Well, what more do you want from me?
Oooo, little crime stoppers, huh? Well, I'm afraid I don't have any crimes I need solved right now.
It's okay. It's okay. I, uh, I, I understand. ...I do.
Oh, but you are noble heroes. We know our thanks is enough. 
Butters, you need... to leave here right now! You need to... get out of here, egeh... Go home and wait for me to talk to talk to you.
L-look, Saddam, I know that you and Satan had a relationship  And I just want you to know  that I'm totally okay with you guys staying friends.
Satan, I'm a '90s man. I cry when I need to. I share my feelings and I keep my mind open about everything.
So Saddam. Satan told me all about how you guys almost took over the world once.
Whoa-ho-ho, let, let me try.  Butters?  Butters, this is your father.
No-huih, no, Butters. Oh, son, why...  Oh... Uh, we're gonna need you to tell a little white lie about where you've been though, alright?
Staples. They went to the video Staples. Where's that, Jimmy?
Oh that troublemaking son of ours! Butters! Butters, you get back here or you are grounded, mister!
Well, our son was ab-ducted. We don't know that he's dead yet.
I still feel secure and safe with you.
Are you almost ready to set off the bomb?
Well, come on, honey, I guess we should start packing up our things as well.
Well, I guess this means the enemy is in our own backyard, so to speak.
We... have an announcement to make, um. Our son has been returned to us. 
Satan, we're not in junior high school anymore.
Yeah, but why did you decide to sponsor a NASCAR driver?
Butters,  look what we have for you to watch: The Lord of the Rings.
The new waiter is useless. And, I think he's high.
My lies may have been deceitful, but your lies cover up something much more horrible than anything I ever did! 
Well somebody tipped off the CIA. I don't know how much they know, but security has been heightened.
Hoof. Well, I don't know about you guys, but all that ginger made me tired.
Backdoor Sluts 9 makes Crotch Capers 3 look like Naughty Nurses 2!
Well, if you two will excuse me, I need to go and buy a certain special lady her anniversary present. Linda: I hope he means me, haha. Butters: Don't be silly, Mom. Of course he means you.
Look, Satan is a very important person to me. And I know he's an important person to you, too. So don't you think it's best for us to just... try and get along? I realize that some things about me bother you. So I'd like to hear what those things are so that I can work on them.
Yes, it sure can be.  But, there are also times when distorting the truth a little, uh, is appropriate. These are called "little white lies."
Oh, well, tell them I'm leavin' their check on the counter. 
Oh no.  No! No, no, Jesus! Linda, what were you thinking?
Us? Your family's all be the shifty-eyed ones!
You bet, son. But Mommy and Daddy have something they have to do first. 
Yeah.  That's hot.  You take it!  You take it now!
No word yet, Tom, but it could be over the embarrassment of the boob job scar video we showed just, just now. Uh, even though the timing doesn't quite work out.
Yeah, well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?
Linda, Butters is gone.  Oh Christ, if Butters is gone, then... there's nothing we can do about that. But I won't let you go to jail, I promise, Linda! Pleeease! 
Now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant the respect they deserve. Right?
We know, but... he hasn't been home since last night. The police have been looking everywhere, but...  Well, thank you. Uh, please, let us know if you find out anything. 
Hey, it's alright. All that matters is that I'm back, and we're together forever. Right?
I'll be back in a little bit.  Butters, you're in charge of the house.
Hey, don't forget that I'm covering for you! 
Butters, the point is that, I think that if you told Mommy what Daddy was doing tonight, well, she might go completely insane.
Oh, well I, I actually slipped down an escalator, in a mall. Those things can be pretty sketchy.
Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't like me very much.
Satan, what the heck is wrong with you?
Yes, the other drivers are not going to be happy about this. What do you think, Mr. Hamill?
It just... it started as some curiosity on the Internet. I would chat with other married guys in the chat rooms and... Well the things they would talk about, Linda, I, I don't know why I found it exciting. I just did, and it, and it grew from there and it spun out of control, and- eh, ugh, DAMN YOU, INTERNET!
Well, come on in. Dinner's just about ready.
Oh, Jesus, no. OH, what have I done?
Come on, Satan. We're all adults here. He was an important person in your life, for better or for worse. So, I wanna know him. If he sees that I'ma real person too, then... well, maybe he'll see how happy we are together.
No! You have to say that a Puerto Rican man dropped you off! 
Well, it's... just that you've washed that same dish seven times now, silly.
Nice to meet you, Saddam! Have a safe walk back!
Hello everyone. Have any of you seen our son?
No, I just want you to go for a quick walk with me. Please?
Come on Jimmy, we don't have a lot of time.
No, Linda! I don't want that lifestyle! It's just kind of an addiction. I want help. And I'm going to get help. Please, just give me a chance to make this all up to you.  We can have a normal life!
Well it appears that all the other drivers have crashed and only the Vagisil car remains. Looks like you're going to win, Mr. Hamill.
Say Butters, m-I'm havin' real trouble finding an anniversary present for Mom. Any ideas?
I've been lookin' all over for you. I have to tell you somethin' that might make you... a little mad.
Now we don't really have a choice, do we?!
Satan. You know you're not a very good liar. You went and saw Saddam, didn't you?
Well, honey, you've painted the entire house. Three times.
You see, I've been deceiving my wife for several months. I was going to gay movies and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers.
Mr. Cartman, congratulations, the theme park is yours. 
The bomb won't make it to Boston now! With the heightened security, it's only a matter of time before they find it!
Well, you know what I think we should do? I think we should all get together and just talk, like adults.
Alright, thanks, Chris. Is the weather going to turn su- 
You see, sometimes telling a little white lie is okay. Like, for instance, when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house.
And we were thinking, since they've all become such close friends, how great it would be for us to all go together to Aspen for a ski weekend.
Yeah, but Dad, why would you invite an ex-girlfriend to dinner?
Well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description, stupid!
Butters! Oh Butters! Could you come and see me in my study real quick?
I think it's important to stay friends with people you've had relationships with.  And I know that Satan and my relationship is strong enough that it can handle anything.  Right?  Right.
This can't be happening! This is a bad dream.
Butters, where is the movie you were watching?
Son, I wanted to talk to you about lying.
Do you have a couple of minutes to go for a walk?
Well, looks like we're gonna have to do somethin' extra-special for Mommy and Daddy's anniversary this year. How about on Saturday we all go have dinner at Bennigan's!
Why sure, Butters. I was just about to get some breakfast. 
I'm just... I'm just trying to be a little more naughty in bed. I uh... I know that's what you like about sex with Saddam. I'm just... showin' you that I can be that way, too.
Naw, Linda! Because you can't now say that the abductor is Costa Rican!  You have to learn to keep it straight!
Yes! And all we have to do is attend a thirty-minute meeting!
I just think we all need to get this out in the open.
Yeah. Just real quick. Around the park or somethin'.
Do you have what it takes to join the Border Patrol? Border Patrol officers are looking for volunteers to help with the reverse immigration crisis.
Uh huh. Yeah. You like that, don't you, bitch?  I'm a bad boy. Yeah. Take that.
