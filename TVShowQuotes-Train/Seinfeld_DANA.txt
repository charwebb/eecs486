Do you hear what you're saying? God isn't out to get you George. What... What is that on your lip?
Well, George, I think you're beginning to get some perspective on things. I think we're making progress.
It's all right don't worry about it. So, why did she break up with you?
Good. So, let's pick up on this next week.
That'd be wonderful George, you'll be rich and successful.
Hello. George, come in. Come in I've heard an awful lot about you. Please sit down.
It doesn't matter. You'll fix it later. Tell me about your girlfriend.
George, George, look at me. Okay, forget about the zipper. ... What's your girlfriend's name?
YEAH!! UGH!!! ARG!!! ... I am afraid we're going to have to stop.
So uh, she broke up with you? ...
