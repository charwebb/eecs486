Wicked.

Sure did.

That's our biggest game ever. Do you think we can win, Coach?

Well then, will you just... win for me?

Lorde isn't just a singer, she's also a very talented scientist who specializes in fluvial geomorphology.

Yeah, that's right.

Sir! Sir, we've found a note!

Wow.  At the Pepsi Center?

Yes?

I feel pretty good, except for the cancer.  Coach? Does God hate me?

Oh.  Hi, coach.

It's gonna be blue balls for all of us.

Don't know... we traveled for hours... kept blacking out... 

I mean, how come I don't get to grow up?

Oh. My cancer hurts.

Yeah, it's a pretty bad time for me, coach. I'm only five and I'm dying.  Coach, what's it like when you die?

How come I have to die now?

She just showed up one day at the office and started filling in for a guy who started working part time. She's a good geologist. When her music career took off we thought she'd be gone, but she still shows up. Usually right after lunch. 

Women love huge balls?

I like Lorde. Uh she's really nice and really talented. But she lives a double life.

I'm telling you Randy, put your time in with the musical, and the rewards afterwards are awesome.

Well you know, you could share some of that with us, Randy.

Randy, you workin' on that sediment analysis?

Alright, look, I am not her uncle. I I just work with her, okay?

All right! Maybe there IS hope for me.

Not anymore I'm not! 

Hm. Looks like that guy just killed you. 

I'm sorry.

I didn't see the game.

I think so.

No hope. No... hope... 

Forty-five minutes non-stop.

Took the wife down to Denver to see that new musical in town.

Coach.
