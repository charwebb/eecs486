I feel pretty good, except for the cancer.  Coach? Does God hate me?
I like Lorde. Uh she's really nice and really talented. But she lives a double life.
Took the wife down to Denver to see that new musical in town.
All right! Maybe there IS hope for me.
Hm. Looks like that guy just killed you. 
Alright, look, I am not her uncle. I I just work with her, okay?
Thanks, coach.  Will you do me just one favor, Coach? That game tonight? I'm gonna be watching, so... could you... make it so I don't have cancer?
Well you know, you could share some of that with us, Randy.
Lorde isn't just a singer, she's also a very talented scientist who specializes in fluvial geomorphology.
I mean, how come I don't get to grow up?
I'm telling you Randy, put your time in with the musical, and the rewards afterwards are awesome.
Well then, will you just... win for me?
Yeah, it's a pretty bad time for me, coach. I'm only five and I'm dying.  Coach, what's it like when you die?
Don't know... we traveled for hours... kept blacking out... 
It's gonna be blue balls for all of us.
She just showed up one day at the office and started filling in for a guy who started working part time. She's a good geologist. When her music career took off we thought she'd be gone, but she still shows up. Usually right after lunch.
