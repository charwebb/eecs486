Don't know... we traveled for hours... kept blacking out... 
Well you know, you could share some of that with us, Randy.
Alright, look, I am not her uncle. I I just work with her, okay?
It's gonna be blue balls for all of us.
I'm telling you Randy, put your time in with the musical, and the rewards afterwards are awesome.
Lorde isn't just a singer, she's also a very talented scientist who specializes in fluvial geomorphology.
Thanks, coach.  Will you do me just one favor, Coach? That game tonight? I'm gonna be watching, so... could you... make it so I don't have cancer?
I feel pretty good, except for the cancer.  Coach? Does God hate me?
I mean, how come I don't get to grow up?
All right! Maybe there IS hope for me.
I like Lorde. Uh she's really nice and really talented. But she lives a double life.
Well then, will you just... win for me?
Yeah, it's a pretty bad time for me, coach. I'm only five and I'm dying.  Coach, what's it like when you die?
Hm. Looks like that guy just killed you. 
Took the wife down to Denver to see that new musical in town.
That's our biggest game ever. Do you think we can win, Coach?
