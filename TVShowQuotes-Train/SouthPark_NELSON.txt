She just showed up one day at the office and started filling in for a guy who started working part time. She's a good geologist. When her music career took off we thought she'd be gone, but she still shows up. Usually right after lunch. 

Yes?

Oh. My cancer hurts.

Wow.  At the Pepsi Center?

Lorde isn't just a singer, she's also a very talented scientist who specializes in fluvial geomorphology.

I'm telling you Randy, put your time in with the musical, and the rewards afterwards are awesome.

I didn't see the game.

I feel pretty good, except for the cancer.  Coach? Does God hate me?

Sir! Sir, we've found a note!

I think so.

All right! Maybe there IS hope for me.

Women love huge balls?

Wicked.

Thanks, coach.  Will you do me just one favor, Coach? That game tonight? I'm gonna be watching, so... could you... make it so I don't have cancer?

Is that a computer game?

Not anymore I'm not! 

Yeah, it's a pretty bad time for me, coach. I'm only five and I'm dying.  Coach, what's it like when you die?

How come I have to die now?

Hm. Looks like that guy just killed you. 

I'm sorry.

No hope. No... hope... 

Well then, will you just... win for me?

That's our biggest game ever. Do you think we can win, Coach?

Took the wife down to Denver to see that new musical in town.

I like Lorde. Uh she's really nice and really talented. But she lives a double life.

Forty-five minutes non-stop.

Don't know... we traveled for hours... kept blacking out... 

Yeah, that's right.

Well you know, you could share some of that with us, Randy.

Randy, you workin' on that sediment analysis?

My legs. I... I think they're broken.

Alright, look, I am not her uncle. I I just work with her, okay?

It's gonna be blue balls for all of us.

Sure did.
