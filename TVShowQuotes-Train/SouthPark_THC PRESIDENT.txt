Get all those tourists out of here! We need this place secured!
Well, at least we weren't outsmarted by a nine-year-old kid.  We should've known. Pilgrims couldn't be from space.
You knew everything else. You somehow knew about all of this. You knew it... here.  You must know... how to get Natalie Portman to open her wormhole.
Wait! Stop, stop! Please, Mr. Standish, we are all on the same side here. We know why there's a stuffing shortage. We've been trying to get the wormhole open.
You boys have been very busy...  We need to know everything that you know.
My God. Would you be willing to say that on camera for an interview?
PLEASE!  We're the History Channel. We care as much about the truth as you do.
You're telling me that somehow during a stuffing shortage, this "Pilgrim" dropped down from space and got into a truck driven by Natalie Portman?!
We are The History Channel.  For years we've been collecting information on Thanksgiving. We're getting close to the truth. And now you boys have exactly the same information. It can't be coincidence.
Please, Ms. Portman, you've got to open your wormhole right now!
Pilgrims and Indians were the aliens! How did we not think of it?!
Give me a piece of chalk.  Huh... Nothing.
Yes? A report from where?  Does Congress know about this yet? Try to keep it contained and get the helicopters ready. I'll be there as soon as I can. 
So then, Professor Broflovski was right after all. 
Curses and cranberries! I must get to Plymouth now! Do as they say!
There has to be a way to get the portal open! Where's our expert?!  What do we do, Professor Broflovski?
But Mr. Standish, I'm afraid it's not that simple. We... tried to get the wormhole open with this symbol and it didn't work.
We were wondering what she had to do with all this! Natalie Portman controls the wormhole!
Have you been contacted by alien life forms?
