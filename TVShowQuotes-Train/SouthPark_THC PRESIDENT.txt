Have you been contacted by alien life forms?
Please, Ms. Portman, you've got to open your wormhole right now!
Pilgrims and Indians were the aliens! How did we not think of it?!
Give me a piece of chalk.  Huh... Nothing.
Get all those tourists out of here! We need this place secured!
There has to be a way to get the portal open! Where's our expert?!  What do we do, Professor Broflovski?
Alright Ms. Portman, we need you to open your wormhole.
We were wondering what she had to do with all this! Natalie Portman controls the wormhole!
But Mr. Standish, I'm afraid it's not that simple. We... tried to get the wormhole open with this symbol and it didn't work.
We are The History Channel.  For years we've been collecting information on Thanksgiving. We're getting close to the truth. And now you boys have exactly the same information. It can't be coincidence.
My God. Would you be willing to say that on camera for an interview?
You boys have been very busy...  We need to know everything that you know.
So then, Professor Broflovski was right after all. 
Curses and cranberries! I must get to Plymouth now! Do as they say!
We have to find Professor Broflovski. He was right about all of this. He'll know what to do.
You knew everything else. You somehow knew about all of this. You knew it... here.  You must know... how to get Natalie Portman to open her wormhole.
Wait! Stop, stop! Please, Mr. Standish, we are all on the same side here. We know why there's a stuffing shortage. We've been trying to get the wormhole open.
Yes? A report from where?  Does Congress know about this yet? Try to keep it contained and get the helicopters ready. I'll be there as soon as I can. 
Well, at least we weren't outsmarted by a nine-year-old kid.  We should've known. Pilgrims couldn't be from space.
