Thank you. I've been traveling from town to town for quite a while. I've started quite a following, mostly because of my levitation tricktwah. Watch.  Watch. 
Sir, c- could you come over here?  Now, what I want you to do, Mr...
Give us what we want or we will continue to die
Your magic is old and outdated, Jesus! Twah. Just like you are.
Okay, jus... s think about your card.  okay, look at me.  Look at me... Look at me... okay, now reach up your ass.
The old religions have failed you! Twah. What have they offered except for war, poverty, and sadness? Blaintology offers you the key to living your life to the fullest! Will you join us?
If the government will not give us tax-exempt status, then we must prove that we are willing to die for our beliefs, twah.
Thank you, everyone.  Our organization grows larger every day. Soon, the government will even have to give us tax-exempt status as a bona fide religion.
The suicide pact will go as planned. If we die, we all die together. 
Then I guess you win this time, Super Best Fools! But I'll be back! 
Okay, now hold this card up to the crowd.  Was that the card you picked?
Mr. Kern, I want you to just... think about a card. Pick any card, and picture it in your mind.
Perhaps you need to see some real magic.
