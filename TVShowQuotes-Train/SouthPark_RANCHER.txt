Well, I ain't got a whole lot left, it bein' almost Thanksgiving and all.  Go ahead, just pick one out. 
Be careful with old Bob here. He ain't much for a-ridin' anymore, but he's all I got.
Dammit, Barbrady, what the hell's wrong with you? Every time somethin' happens in this town, you say "Nothin' to see here", and "Case closed." But we want justice. We have to find this sicko!
I know! Now I gotta find somethin' else to shoot.
Well I think we can set ya up.

You'll snort K and I'll snort K, we'll fight an' screw all night and day.
Honey, babe, be mine.

Oh, that one's a little messed up. Not exactly the... pick of the litter.
Yeah. Best you not take that one. I was just about to take it out in the yard and putt a bullet in its head.
I've got a one-legged pig if you'd like, too.
Now let me get this straight: You want four horses, one for each of ya?
What kind of turkey are you lookin' for?
Well, the way I see it, if he really is who he says he is, well then he'd better do somethin' on New Year's Eve, 'cause it's in the Bible!
Barbrady, I just caught some guy in here having sex with one of my chickens.
