You just said that you said it.
So, where do you wanna go? (as she puts her hand on his shoulder)
(to Jerry) Can we go?
Really, how?
What are you doing?
I'm getting out of here. (to Jerry) Don't call me.
What's with this music?
What do you think I'm doing? (he won't get his massage...)
I have to tell you, I really don't like him.
(to George) So what did she say?
Now you however, you, I like. (she stops massaging and kisses Jerry)
I don't know how you can hang out with that guy.
So what's the deal with your friend George?
A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene.
Hey.
Yeah. I heard you.
I was giving Kramer a massage.
No, I can't!
Listen. I massage who I want, when I want. I don't submit to forcible massage. (he tries desperately to get her hands on his shoulders again but she pulls them away immediately) I'm getting out of here.
It's just I hate that type.
We have nothing to talk about.
Nice meeting you Karen.
Actually, I should get a new one.
Yeah. (she and Jerry walk away)
What was all that "attractive women not getting tickets" nonsense?
No means no.
I can't (she tries harder to pull her hands away)
(she stops massaging) No. No, this isn't good. I can't do this.
I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the violent overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell me he is in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, but quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm Jodi Baskerville, back to you in the studio.
They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public appearance.
You've never met. (the cab starts and George is following to keep talking to Jodi)
Hey, Jerry.
Hi. (kiss) I was running late and I didn't have a chance to drop off my stuff before I came over.
Did you see the way that he was eating?
How can you say that? My sister got a ticket last week. Are you saying she's not attractive?
