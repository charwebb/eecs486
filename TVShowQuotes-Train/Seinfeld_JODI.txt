(to George) So what did she say?
I was giving Kramer a massage.
You've never met. (the cab starts and George is following to keep talking to Jodi)
I don't know how you can hang out with that guy.
It's just I hate that type.
Did you see the way that he was eating?
No, I can't!
I have to tell you, I really don't like him.
Hey, Jerry.
Yeah. I heard you.
What are you doing?
I'm getting out of here. (to Jerry) Don't call me.
Now you however, you, I like. (she stops massaging and kisses Jerry)
What was all that "attractive women not getting tickets" nonsense?
Really, how?
You just said that you said it.
What's with this music?
Yeah. (she and Jerry walk away)
So what's the deal with your friend George?
Nice meeting you Karen.
We have nothing to talk about.
I can't (she tries harder to pull her hands away)
Hey.
I got to run. I have an appointment downtown.
Listen. I massage who I want, when I want. I don't submit to forcible massage. (he tries desperately to get her hands on his shoulders again but she pulls them away immediately) I'm getting out of here.
No that's O.K.
Hi. (kiss) I was running late and I didn't have a chance to drop off my stuff before I came over.
How can you say that? My sister got a ticket last week. Are you saying she's not attractive?
Oh yeah.
What do you think I'm doing? (he won't get his massage...)
No means no.
Actually, I should get a new one.
A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene.
So, where do you wanna go? (as she puts her hand on his shoulder)
(she stops massaging) No. No, this isn't good. I can't do this.
