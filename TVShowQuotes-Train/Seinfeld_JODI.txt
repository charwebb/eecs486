A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene.
We have nothing to talk about.
(she stops massaging) No. No, this isn't good. I can't do this.
You just said that you said it.
Now you however, you, I like. (she stops massaging and kisses Jerry)
Hey.
Listen. I massage who I want, when I want. I don't submit to forcible massage. (he tries desperately to get her hands on his shoulders again but she pulls them away immediately) I'm getting out of here.
What's with this music?
Yeah. (she and Jerry walk away)
How can you say that? My sister got a ticket last week. Are you saying she's not attractive?
No that's O.K.
They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public appearance.
So, where do you wanna go? (as she puts her hand on his shoulder)
Really, how?
I can't (she tries harder to pull her hands away)
Yeah. I heard you.
I'm getting out of here. (to Jerry) Don't call me.
(to Jerry) Can we go?
Did you see the way that he was eating?
You've never met. (the cab starts and George is following to keep talking to Jodi)
No means no.
I was giving Kramer a massage.
It's just I hate that type.
Nice meeting you Karen.
No, I can't!
Oh yeah.
So what's the deal with your friend George?
Hey, Jerry.
I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the violent overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell me he is in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, but quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm Jodi Baskerville, back to you in the studio.
What do you think I'm doing? (he won't get his massage...)
What was all that "attractive women not getting tickets" nonsense?
I got to run. I have an appointment downtown.
Actually, I should get a new one.
I have to tell you, I really don't like him.
Hi. (kiss) I was running late and I didn't have a chance to drop off my stuff before I came over.
