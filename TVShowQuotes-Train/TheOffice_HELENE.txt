Ooh, somebody has a full diaper.
Hmm... I might have done it when I was younger, but now there's just other things I'd rather be doing, instead of running and jumping and swimming--
I'm 58.  What am I supposed to do now?
Oh you'll love it.  You can have my guide books.  I think I'm done with those really long plane rides.
You want to go snowboarding?
[on speaker phone] Hi, honey, it's mom. Look, Cece's school just called. She still has lice.
Oh no, I think a triathlon is pretty much something I can rule out.  It just-- doesn't interest me.
[laughs] Sticking with 49.
Thank you. [they hug]
What did you think we were?
Michael, what are you talking about?
Ok, there's a penny.  What's that from?
It'll go away in time just don't touch it.
Oh, well I like Nana, but I also like the classic Grandma.
No.  I'm 58.
I'm, uh...  You know I think, uh, I think it's time for me to go.
Um-- I have the measles and the mumps, a gash, a rash and purple bumps. And my teachers really mean-- Happy Birthday , I love you Helene.
Hello, Michael.
I think for you to have come here even expecting that we can have a conversation like this show's ho-how self deluded you are! Michael, your memory has failed you greatly.
Love you.
Michael?
It was from the wishing well at the mall.  You threw it in.  I went back later, waded in and I found it.
He put it around my neck while I was still asleep this morning.  What a nice way to wake up.
[sees table decorated with a banner and balloons] Oh my God!
I think it's wonderful, absolutely wonderful.
I'm sure I won't.
Uh huh.
Oh--
Oh, Michael what do you think?  Grandma?
Wait a minute.  [looks at the bag in Michael's hand] Is that another birthday present for me cause you already gave me a necklace.
Oh, I know.  I love how they use butter cream frosting.
I, um-- I got it.
Oh, oh no.  I don't think so.
Well, you know-- Michael and I were-- talking, and maybe if you put a little more face to face time with your clients you could improve your sales.
So, Pammy-- are you still liking sales?
[looking through the book]  A poem!
[holding the baby, walks up to Jim] Hi, honey. I was just changing the baby.
Well, thank you.  All of you.
No, no... [laughs]
[opens present, reads inscription] A scrapbook of our first memories by Michael Gary Scott.  For my girlfriend Helene on your birthday.  [laughs]
[hugging book] God... it's a scrapbook.
Tell her how you gave it to me.
Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee.
Hmmm?
