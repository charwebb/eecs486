Gimme.  Look at this wrapping paper.  It's got the word love on it in every language.
[opens present, reads inscription] A scrapbook of our first memories by Michael Gary Scott.  For my girlfriend Helene on your birthday.  [laughs]
[sees table decorated with a banner and balloons] Oh my God!
I'm, uh...  You know I think, uh, I think it's time for me to go.
Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee.
Oh you'll love it.  You can have my guide books.  I think I'm done with those really long plane rides.
Um-- I have the measles and the mumps, a gash, a rash and purple bumps. And my teachers really mean-- Happy Birthday , I love you Helene.
[reading]  I can not go to school today said little Peggy Ann McKay...
Oh no, I think a triathlon is pretty much something I can rule out.  It just-- doesn't interest me.
[holding the baby, walks up to Jim] Hi, honey. I was just changing the baby.
Now, don't worry, don't worry. I'm on my way to pick her up, but you might have lice too. You know, lice can be tricky. Sometimes lice, like...[Pam hangs up phone]
Well, as long as you're running numbers Pam, then help me out with this one.  Let's see your six months pregnant, but you've only been married for 30 days, so what does that add up to?
It'll go away in time just don't touch it.
Tell her how you gave it to me.
Oh, I know.  I love how they use butter cream frosting.
He put it around my neck while I was still asleep this morning.  What a nice way to wake up.
Wait a minute.  [looks at the bag in Michael's hand] Is that another birthday present for me cause you already gave me a necklace.
It was from the wishing well at the mall.  You threw it in.  I went back later, waded in and I found it.
Oh, well I like Nana, but I also like the classic Grandma.
Well, you know-- Michael and I were-- talking, and maybe if you put a little more face to face time with your clients you could improve your sales.
I'm 58.  What am I supposed to do now?
[on speaker phone] Hi, honey, it's mom. Look, Cece's school just called. She still has lice.
