Obviously. I don't even think she called me back.
Jim and Pam really don't want you to go?
Look, I'm just glad we can laugh about it. Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here, with, you know, our history.
Oh, you know...funny. Your wife and I went on a few dates.
You know what it was? I think she gave me her number but then her fours look like eights, and...
What do you mean, my tricks? There's no tricks, man. I'm just a good salesman. You wanna copy that? You can't copy that! [opens door to leave]
Okay. Honestly. I didn't call you back because I-thought you seemed a little... dorky.
Oh, well then, yeah. All right. Hey! [knocking on wall] Good luck, guys. Seems like you got a great operation here.
I was looking forward to throwing some darts with you guys.
Okay, so you...set up this fake company, then you hired this homeless woman to impersonate an executive to spy on me so that you could copy my sales technique?
[laughing] Well, that does not sound like me.
Ha ha, okay, there you go! [phone rings, Meredith answers]
Hey, Dwight. Good to see you. Jim, hey.
You know what? I may have parked my car in a compact space, and I hate when I see others do that, so-
I've never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on...why not, huh?
I'm gonna take off my coat, if you don't mind. It's a bit warm in here.
Okay. You wanna know?  I didn't call her back because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you.
[stops laughing] Well, great, I just wanted to make sure that things weren't weird.
Well, whatever works for ya. Anyway. All right.
Sure. You seem like a fun, professional guy.
Well, actually, uh... no, Miss Van Helsing, that's not why I'm here. I'm here to meet you, see if we'd be a, you know, good fit.
Do you honestly want to know why I didn't call her back on a date over four years ago?
Was it two? I thought it was three.
We should think of this as a first date. And I think it's going very well, how 'bout you?
I swear to God, I'm gonna hit you. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. I'm not-it's just I'm very upset right now.
It's good to see you guys. Nice to meet you.
