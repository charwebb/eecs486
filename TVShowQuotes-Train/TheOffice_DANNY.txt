What are you talking about?
I'll talk to them.
Danny Cordray. It's great to meet you.
I'm very upset!
Okay, so you...set up this fake company, then you hired this homeless woman to impersonate an executive to spy on me so that you could copy my sales technique?
Okay. You wanna know?  I didn't call her back because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you.
Gabe-wad.
Yeah, sure.
Ha ha, okay, there you go! [phone rings, Meredith answers]
Okay.
Look, I'm just glad we can laugh about it. Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here, with, you know, our history.
Oh, well then, yeah. All right. Hey! [knocking on wall] Good luck, guys. Seems like you got a great operation here.
Okay. Honestly. I didn't call you back because I-thought you seemed a little... dorky.
Thanks.
More freedom.
I'm gonna take off my coat, if you don't mind. It's a bit warm in here.
Okay...that's different.
For sure.
Well, we'll get this...[Meredith unbuttons]
Was it two? I thought it was three.
Oh.
Uh...I mean-yeah.
Three of you guys for one sale.
[opening door again to leave] No!
What do you mean, my tricks? There's no tricks, man. I'm just a good salesman. You wanna copy that? You can't copy that! [opens door to leave]
Public School, at exit 11.
Oh, you know...funny. Your wife and I went on a few dates.
[stops laughing] Well, great, I just wanted to make sure that things weren't weird.
Well, whatever works for ya. Anyway. All right.
But from where?
Obviously. I don't even think she called me back.
Get out of my way.
You know what it was? I think she gave me her number but then her fours look like eights, and...
Hmm.
I was looking forward to throwing some darts with you guys.
Okay.
This is some party, huh?
Hey.
You know what? I may have parked my car in a compact space, and I hate when I see others do that, so-
Thank you.
Hey.
Yeah. Way ,way, way back.
Are you serious?
No! Two or three dates.
We should think of this as a first date. And I think it's going very well, how 'bout you?
So. You're all on the list!
Michael Scott.
Danny Cordray, Osprey Paper.
I swear to God, I'm gonna hit you. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. I'm not-it's just I'm very upset right now.
I don't think it's gonna work out the way you think.
Or...crazy.
Hola. Que tal?
Well, actually, uh... no, Miss Van Helsing, that's not why I'm here. I'm here to meet you, see if we'd be a, you know, good fit.
Do you honestly want to know why I didn't call her back on a date over four years ago?
[laughing] Well, that does not sound like me.
It's good to see you guys. Nice to meet you.
Sure. You seem like a fun, professional guy.
Oh, I'm just here for the coffee.
I'm gonna go.
I've never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on...why not, huh?
Exactly.
