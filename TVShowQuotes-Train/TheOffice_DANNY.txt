More freedom.
Danny Cordray. It's great to meet you.
This is some party, huh?
I'm gonna take off my coat, if you don't mind. It's a bit warm in here.
Can you imagine? It's just crazy.
Well, actually, uh... no, Miss Van Helsing, that's not why I'm here. I'm here to meet you, see if we'd be a, you know, good fit.
Hmm.
We should think of this as a first date. And I think it's going very well, how 'bout you?
What do you mean, my tricks? There's no tricks, man. I'm just a good salesman. You wanna copy that? You can't copy that! [opens door to leave]
You know what it was? I think she gave me her number but then her fours look like eights, and...
Oh.
What are you talking about?
Okay, so you...set up this fake company, then you hired this homeless woman to impersonate an executive to spy on me so that you could copy my sales technique?
Get out of my way.
Danny Cordray, Osprey Paper.
Okay. You wanna know?  I didn't call her back because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you.
Look, I'm just glad we can laugh about it. Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here, with, you know, our history.
[laughing] Well, that does not sound like me.
Well, we'll get this...[Meredith unbuttons]
Oh, I'm just here for the coffee.
Yeah, sure.
Jim and Pam really don't want you to go?
Sure. You seem like a fun, professional guy.
Three of you guys for one sale.
Or...crazy.
No! Two or three dates.
But from where?
Okay.
Oh. She was not into me.
Okay. Honestly. I didn't call you back because I-thought you seemed a little... dorky.
I was looking forward to throwing some darts with you guys.
[stops laughing] Well, great, I just wanted to make sure that things weren't weird.
Do you honestly want to know why I didn't call her back on a date over four years ago?
Ha ha, okay, there you go! [phone rings, Meredith answers]
It's good to see you guys. Nice to meet you.
So. You're all on the list!
Obviously. I don't even think she called me back.
Uh...I mean-yeah.
Well, whatever works for ya. Anyway. All right.
I've never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on...why not, huh?
Gabe-wad.
Excuse me, everybody. I want to invite you all to the Halloween party I'm having at my bar.
Hey.
Okay...that's different.
I'll talk to them.
I'm very upset!
Are you serious?
Michael Scott.
Hey.
I don't think it's gonna work out the way you think.
Oh, you know...funny. Your wife and I went on a few dates.
Public School, at exit 11.
Okay.
Was it two? I thought it was three.
Yeah. Way ,way, way back.
For sure.
Hola. Que tal?
Exactly.
I swear to God, I'm gonna hit you. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. I'm not-it's just I'm very upset right now.
Okay.
[opening door again to leave] No!
