Okay. You wanna know?  I didn't call her back because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you.
Okay.
What are you talking about?
We should think of this as a first date. And I think it's going very well, how 'bout you?
Look, I'm just glad we can laugh about it. Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here, with, you know, our history.
Oh. She was not into me.
Gabe-wad.
Good to see you too.
Okay. Honestly. I didn't call you back because I-thought you seemed a little... dorky.
Was it two? I thought it was three.
Exactly.
More freedom.
Oh, you know...funny. Your wife and I went on a few dates.
Michael Scott.
I don't think it's gonna work out the way you think.
You know what? I may have parked my car in a compact space, and I hate when I see others do that, so-
I'm very upset!
Obviously. I don't even think she called me back.
I've never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on...why not, huh?
You know what it was? I think she gave me her number but then her fours look like eights, and...
Ha ha, okay, there you go! [phone rings, Meredith answers]
I swear to God, I'm gonna hit you. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. I'm not-it's just I'm very upset right now.
Or...crazy.
So. You're all on the list!
Thanks.
Okay.
Oh, I'm just here for the coffee.
Okay, so you...set up this fake company, then you hired this homeless woman to impersonate an executive to spy on me so that you could copy my sales technique?
For sure.
Oh.
Are you serious?
Well, we'll get this...[Meredith unbuttons]
It's good to see you guys. Nice to meet you.
Yeah, sure.
I'm gonna go.
[stops laughing] Well, great, I just wanted to make sure that things weren't weird.
Public School, at exit 11.
Three of you guys for one sale.
Hey.
No! Two or three dates.
Danny Cordray, Osprey Paper.
But from where?
I'm gonna take off my coat, if you don't mind. It's a bit warm in here.
Hey.
Oh, well then, yeah. All right. Hey! [knocking on wall] Good luck, guys. Seems like you got a great operation here.
Can you imagine? It's just crazy.
Hmm.
[laughing] Well, that does not sound like me.
Okay.
Jim and Pam really don't want you to go?
[opening door again to leave] No!
Do you honestly want to know why I didn't call her back on a date over four years ago?
Okay...that's different.
I'll talk to them.
Well, actually, uh... no, Miss Van Helsing, that's not why I'm here. I'm here to meet you, see if we'd be a, you know, good fit.
Sure. You seem like a fun, professional guy.
This is some party, huh?
Get out of my way.
Danny Cordray. It's great to meet you.
Well, whatever works for ya. Anyway. All right.
Thank you.
