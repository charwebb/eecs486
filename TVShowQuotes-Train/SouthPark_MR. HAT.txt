Who's there?

You can say that again, Mr. Garrison. 

You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.

Yeah, why the hell is that little Jewish kid playing quarterback?

I sure did, Mr. Garrison. What a retard! 

Mr. Garrison isn't here right now.

Kill!

That's right, Mr. Garrison. Christopher Columbus discovered America and was the Indians' best friend. He helped the Indians win their war against Fredrick Douglass and a freed the Hebrews from Napoleon and discovered France. And then in 1492...

Hello kids, it's me, Mr. Hat. 

I think it looks great.

Yes, conjugate the verb.

That's right, Mr. Garrison. The Vietnam War was sticky and icky.

Well, I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids.

Yeah, we all put our life savings in this game.

I'm your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan.  You can tell me anything.  Now, who hits you, is it your father, or your mother?

Oh, just one more Cosmopolitan, Mr. Garrison.

You're not fooling anyone!

Watching that show is bad, Mr. Garrison.

You heard me, jackass! There's monkeys that make better counselors than you!

Dammit Mitch, you're asking questions that shouldn't be answered!

It sure is, Mr. Garrison!

Check out his hot bulge, too.

Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering lets us correct God's horrible, horrible mistakes, like German people.

Why would he want to talk to a second-rate dopey-ass elementary-school psychologist?!

You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.

No! No, you moron!  Mr. Garrison can't let the memories end! Just leave us alone!

Roar.

Life isn't fair kiddo, get used to it.

That sounds incredible, Mr. Garrison.

Well, Kyle, no!! You hear me?! You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!

Thank you. 

We can still get her! Let mmm--

What was wrong with that plan?

Orange who?

Oh, good one, Sherlock! You figure that out all by yourself?!

Kill her.

Boy, that Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass around.

That's right, Mr. Garrison, Englebert Humperdink was the first person on the moon, who was the second?

I said Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass!

But now she's coming to South Park, and I know a way to make it all better.

Gosh Mr. Garrison, this sure is exciting.

Hmmm. You boys get first prize.

Kill her.

You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!

We could have won that talent show, we could have been huge.

The bitch must die!

Have you forgotten about all the pain and suffering that Kathie Lee Gifford caused you?

I... I don't believe I know you.
