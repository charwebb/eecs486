You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.

It happened again didn't it? Now we do things my way.

Gosh Mr. Garrison, this sure is exciting.

I said Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass!

Kill her.

But now she's coming to South Park, and I know a way to make it all better.

Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering lets us correct God's horrible, horrible mistakes, like German people.

Oh, just one more Cosmopolitan, Mr. Garrison.

I think it looks great.

Well, Kyle, no!! You hear me?! You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!

Hello kids, it's me, Mr. Hat. 

Thank you. 

I sure did, Mr. Garrison. What a retard! 

That's right Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering is an exciting new science.  You can splice the DNA from some animals, and make them better.

This is insane, Mr. Garrison. 

Well, how about Stan, our little South Park quarterback star?

She'll make a fool of you again.

Who's there?

Mr. Garrison isn't here right now.

Life isn't fair kiddo, get used to it.

Hmmm. You boys get first prize.

That sounds incredible, Mr. Garrison.

That's right, Mr. Garrison. The Vietnam War was sticky and icky.

Check out his hot bulge, too.

Kill!

We can still get her! Let mmm--

What was wrong with that plan?

You're not fooling anyone!

Yeah, we all put our life savings in this game.

You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.

I'm your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan.  You can tell me anything.  Now, who hits you, is it your father, or your mother?

You can say that again, Mr. Garrison. 

Dammit Mitch, you're asking questions that shouldn't be answered!

Roar.

Watching that show is bad, Mr. Garrison.

Why would he want to talk to a second-rate dopey-ass elementary-school psychologist?!

That's right, Mr. Garrison, Englebert Humperdink was the first person on the moon, who was the second?

Have you forgotten about all the pain and suffering that Kathie Lee Gifford caused you?

The bitch must die!

We could have won that talent show, we could have been huge.

Kill her.

Boy, that Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass around.

I... I don't believe I know you.

You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!

No! No, you moron!  Mr. Garrison can't let the memories end! Just leave us alone!

Oh, good one, Sherlock! You figure that out all by yourself?!

Well, I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids.

It sure is, Mr. Garrison!
