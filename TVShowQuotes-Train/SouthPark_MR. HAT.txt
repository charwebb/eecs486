We could have won that talent show, we could have been huge.
I sure did, Mr. Garrison. What a retard! 
Dammit Mitch, you're asking questions that shouldn't be answered!
Have you forgotten about all the pain and suffering that Kathie Lee Gifford caused you?
Yeah, we all put our life savings in this game.
Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering lets us correct God's horrible, horrible mistakes, like German people.
Well, Kyle, no!! You hear me?! You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
Well, I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids.
Well, how about Stan, our little South Park quarterback star?
Boy, that Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass around.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. Christopher Columbus discovered America and was the Indians' best friend. He helped the Indians win their war against Fredrick Douglass and a freed the Hebrews from Napoleon and discovered France. And then in 1492...
That's right, Mr. Garrison, Englebert Humperdink was the first person on the moon, who was the second?
It happened again didn't it? Now we do things my way.
No! No, you moron!  Mr. Garrison can't let the memories end! Just leave us alone!
That's right Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering is an exciting new science.  You can splice the DNA from some animals, and make them better.
I said Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass!
Why would he want to talk to a second-rate dopey-ass elementary-school psychologist?!
Oh, good one, Sherlock! You figure that out all by yourself?!
I'm your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan.  You can tell me anything.  Now, who hits you, is it your father, or your mother?
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The Vietnam War was sticky and icky.
Yeah, why the hell is that little Jewish kid playing quarterback?
But now she's coming to South Park, and I know a way to make it all better.
