Ah those are the pastries, Ray take care of that, I'm going to get Elaine the manuscript.
Maybe I put it out on your face! (To Elaine) Its just like Ray said. You and Jerry are jealous of our love. Youre trying to destroy us.
And we have to get back to work.
(from the kitchen) Ray, would you give me a hand?
You know, Ray is very upset over these accusations.
Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, or just coincidences? Well?! Well?!
My mother left us when I was six years old. All seven of us. We never heard from her again. I hope shes rotting in an alley somewhere!
Well, if they dont let you be my editor on this book, Ill go to another publisher. Its that simple.
Thats what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and big coincidences!
Daantotin. (There is a sound of the front door being unlocked.) Theres Ray... late as usual.
No. We made love on the floor like two animals. Ray is insatiable.
