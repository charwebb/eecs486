I am not discussing this. This is insane.
So, I don't want people coming into my kitchen. I think she might have sneezed all over someone's pasta primavera. Someone might have gotten sick because of her. (Kramer and Gail exit.)
Hi, Elaine. (To Jerry) Hey, what is with your friend Kramer?
Being a mother has made me feel so beautiful.
She comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen, and starts complaining that I'm talking about her shoes.
Well, tell him that I am mad at him.
Ooh, Botticelli's! Look at you! I'm afraid to go in there.
So, how come? Why did Kramer do that?
Yeah, I'm sure. What did you tell him?
Sauce this. (Goes to the telephone and dials.) Yeah, he's here. Oh, and one more thing...bring the shoes. (Hangs up.)
