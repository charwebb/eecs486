Sauce this. (Goes to the telephone and dials.) Yeah, he's here. Oh, and one more thing...bring the shoes. (Hangs up.)
Hi, Elaine. (To Jerry) Hey, what is with your friend Kramer?
Well, tell him that I am mad at him.
She comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen, and starts complaining that I'm talking about her shoes.
So, I don't want people coming into my kitchen. I think she might have sneezed all over someone's pasta primavera. Someone might have gotten sick because of her. (Kramer and Gail exit.)
So, how come? Why did Kramer do that?
No, no, I gotta get to the restaurant. (Looks at her watch.) Oh! See ya. (Exits.)
Yeah, I'm sure. What did you tell him?
I am not discussing this. This is insane.
Ooh, Botticelli's! Look at you! I'm afraid to go in there.
