This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what?
I know, but, I'm afraid it's too late for them, sweetie. We have to try and save ourselves now.
Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick.
Well sure, Sheila. Our husbands are all so clean and neat. My Randy irons his clothes and even has pedicures.
I don't know what the hell they're talking about.
Sorry, Stan. you know you're not allowed to listen to this stuff.
You see? He's out of control. It's nearly torn our whole family apart.
I've got a surprise for you too, Randy.
Do you really think this is a good idea, Randy?
Get off the Internet, Stanley, it's time for bed.
You watch your mouth, Stanley! The Native Americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us!
Uh okay, fine. So you're gonna take my son to a dream within a dream, and then what?
Oh, alright, but take your grampy with you.
Randy, it's getting late. Let's just go to sleep.
All right.  Do you know why young people like Lorde so much.  It's because she's something different. Kids have had pop music artists flash tits and crotch in their face, and most kids are actually smart enough to be sick of it. Lorde represents something in all of us, the truth that wants to be heard. If I could talk to Lorde right now, you know what I'd tell her? I'd tell her not to let people change who she is. I'd tell her that if people are making fun of her, it's probably because they lost touch with being human. I'd tell her to keep on doing what she does, because when someone's not allowed to express who they are inside, then we all lose. That's... what I would say to Lorde. 
Here we go, everyone. I got three nice steaks from South Park Grocery. We'll have to share them.
Oh, this is so nice. I really needed this.
So, what are we going to do about our children?  Ahhh, hello-o?
Stan, what did I tell you about watching The Osbournes?
You're doing this to try and get to the front of the line on Black Friday, aren't you?
Oho that was so much fun! All the costumes and the sets were amazing! I really love the songs. That Stephen Schwartz is a genius! I've got them all stuck in my head.  Hey, that was such a treat. How would you like a little treat? 
Randy, the storeroom, we've gotta get to the storeroom! 
You have to understand that Kenny's body isn't up in the clouds. He was cremated.
Ooh, who wants ice cream with their cake?
Randy? Do you have something to tell me?
That's right, everyone just dig in.  So, kids,anything happen with your whole Sunday off?
Honestly, I don't see what they find so amusing about those things.
To be honest, Mrs. Tucker, we think Craig is bad influence on our boys.
Stanley, I thought I told you not to watch this horrible cartoon!
Sheila, I was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick?
Go?? The meteor shower hasn't even started yet.
You were told to walk out in front of a hundred thousand people including little girls who look up to you, and start rubbing your clit.
Randy, I can't get my e-mail to open.
STANLEY, YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW!
I'll leave you two alone to get acquainted. 
I've told you what I think of this music, Stanley. You have plenty of other gifts to enjoy.
Randy please! You've got to listen to me!
Look! There's one of the boys now!  Jimmy!
He's not allowed to come out of his room, so you can talk to him through the door.
Uh, Stan,  don't you think you're upsetting your future self a little?
Oh my gosh, yes! They said like 14 people died.
The answer is no, Stanley! Now go wash up for supper!
Why? Because there's fishnet stockings inside your jeans?
Well, hold on, Randy, I think a turd sandwich is a little better than them having a giant douche on their uniforms.
The nineteen year old pop star. It's true, that's him.
But the Bubble Gum Prince wasn't afraid. He knew that the Land of Chocolate was safe forever and ever.  Goodnight my little angel. 
I'm telling you, Randy, I think this sport is doing something to your brain.
Well how long have you been feeling this way?
I'm unhappy too. We both are, obviously. How much longer can we keep doing this? It's like, the same shit just happens over and over and, then in a week it just all resets until- it happens again. Every week it's kind of the same story in a different way but it, it just keeps getting more and more ridiculous.
Shelly, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan.
Will they be able to wake Mackey up?
What ever?! In fifteen years you've never said, "whatever," to me!
Uh, Stanley, take the garbage out before you go to bed.
Yes. Too bad it was their last show, or I'd go see it again.
Just stay down, Shelly. It can't come in here. 
Oh is that what you think?! That I'm dead?!
We don't have to have sex for our relationship to be good.
So it's not such a crazy idea after all?
Randy, relax. We don't ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment!
You want me to bring you some McDonald's?
WHAT does our son turning 10 have to do with you making the same mistakes again and again?!
Well, of course you can. Come in out of the snow. 
Soon you'll be old enough to make your own choices, but for now, I just don't want you listening to that stuff.
Oh. Well, anyway, here's a pencil and some paper.
Shake Weight, you aren't really workout equipment at all, are you?
Hey, dad, I need to talk to you about this party we're having.
I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again.
Then how do you know I blocked them?
And how about our boys, huh? Ever since gay culture became cool, our boys bathe every night and brush their teeth three times a day. This is the greatest thing ever.
He's upstairs videotaping your grandfather in the bathtub.
Yeah. Come on, Sheila, let's go to the nickel slots.
Stanley I want you to understand that even though I won't let you listen to certain kinds of music, I still love you.
Well, now I am worried. I've tried all the houses and nobody knows where they are.
Ooh, a tampon made from Cherokee hair—now that sounds natural.
It's... not because I'm older. I'm telling you, our music is better.
Well, it looks like our little Stanley has built himself quite a clubhouse here.
The doctor says that maybe you can go home tomorrow.
Oh, look at our boys, Sheila.  It's just like they're in college again.
Randy, Randy, calm down. I can't understand what you're saying.
Randy, you've been watching that channel, haven't you?!
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son Craig. Do you have any idea where they could've gone?
You really think women cared that much about queefing? Is that really what you think this has all been about? This has been about women having a little bit of fun for once at your expense. For just this one time we could be the immature ones to make you feel uncomfortable. But no, you just couldn't let us have that one little thing, could you? Because even though things are getting better for women, you still think of us as lesser people sometimes, and we always have to prove ourselves twice as hard. Congratulations, guys.  For getting your way... again. 
Well, it is kind of a special night. I guess I could... experiment. 
Well, we're supposed to have the Broflovskis and the Stotches over for dinner tonight. Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too.
Oh, wasn't it? I mean, the first sentence: 
Stan? Stanley? You haven't seen your little friend Butters, have you? 
Randy?  Randy! Randy, you need to read this!
Randy, I don't want our marriage to fail. I don't know how to fix what's wrong, but please, can't we just go to bed and start fresh in the morning?
Oh, right, uh. Good bye, Stan. I-I love you. 
Like you're one to talk! When's the last time you really listened to what I had to say?!
No, it can't be! My son is not a filthy smoker! 
Let's not make a big deal out of it.
This book! Our son and his friends wrote it!
Right, just like your eyes are kind of far apart. 
Huh?  Oh. Yeah, it is.  What are they doing here? They can afford to shop at Cherry Creek. 
There, you did it again!  He interrupted me again.
Yeah, our son has always been fairly clean.
S-stanley you don't need to do that. He-he is your future self.
Stanley, it's almost eight o'clock. Where have you been?
Well it's just a block of wood and some wheels; I don't think there's that much more you can do with it.
Randy, my wedding ring! I lost it down the garbage disposal!
Yes, because every time you watch cooking shows you stay up all night trying to copy what they made.
Now Stanley, you have to understand how divorce works. When I say, "you're the most important thing to me," what I mean is, you're the most important thing after me and my happiness and my new romances.
You do this all the time! First you're obsessed with baseball fights! Then you need to play Warcraft! Then you gotta be a celebrity chef! 
Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!
How are you going to tell her that the singer she's idolized has been you?
Boys, I do not want you going over to Mr. Jefferson's anymore. Do you understand?
Stan, sweetie, we're gonna go to the mall. Do you wanna come?
Fine, Randy!  You go listen to it and tell me you don't think it sounds like crap! 
Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now.
There's a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named "Miss Information."
"Your room is being serviced"? Ugh, oh well.  Uhh, excuse me?
None of the other kids have seen them since a-  Randy, will you put that thing down?! What is wrong with you?! Our son is missing!
Oh, Stanley. Let's just forget the whole thing and have a nice holiday back home.
It's okay. We trust that you know what you're doing. 
Looks like you'd better really watch out for marijuana, huh Stan?
We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because, honestly, we don't know how to feel.
Why are men so obsessed with how big their crap is?!
Go, Stanley!  Ahaha, ahem. Heheh, he, he gets very good grades.
You lazy jerk! You never do anything around the house! 
Oh my God, first you take me to Wicked and now this?
Sorry, Karen, you were saying? No, it wasn't a customer. No, it's just Randy.  Yes, a customer would have been nice, I know.
I don't care how long I've had it, I want my money back!
...Oh my God. Our son is with those people.
No, you'r right, Randy. Without any sex we just seem to get madder and madder at each other.
Did you know that your son is supposed to be grounded and he snuck out to go to Red Robin?!
Well, the kids at school made you a card, Kyle. Look. 
What do we do, Randy? We can't support our son talking like this, but I, I mean.
Yeah, her and little Larry Feegan. They're going to see "Wicked" together. It's Shelly's first Broadway musical.
Oho, more than a chance. Randy's actually having a meeting right now with Stephen Sondheim.
Who the hell is that woman, Randy?! What the hell do you think you're doing?!
Well that's fine! You boys can just stay in there and starve to death. Us parents are going to go to Pizza Shack and have pepperoni pizza and ice cream.
Alright, Stanley, this has gone on long enough! Your little game is over!
I was. Can you help me unload the car? 
Now, Stanley. The Internet will be waiting for you in the morning. Off!
You know, a racist, but against people from the-
Now get some sleep, baby. Mommy's taken care of everything.
Please, I don't know where else to turn. The police haven't been any help, ugheh, I think our boys might really be in trouble this time. Yes. Yes. Please, check and call me right back. Thank you.  Randy I swear to God if you don't put that thing away...!
You were stimulating the dog, Stanley! What came out of him was his... r-Randy?!
He's right. If we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs, then they're never gonna believe anything we tell them
Oh, he's in the back. He set up a video camera so he can tape the performance.
I don't know. You know, to me, it seems like the mayor of Beaverton should've done something about that dam years ago.
Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and Daddy's book club night, remember?
Stanley, what did I say about being a smartass?!
Oh I know! He tried out all his recipes here and left me with the mess!
It's a long story, Shelly. Let's just say your father... has a lot up his ass right now.
Nuh-nn No, this is crazy! Musical theater people are respected. Refined. Cultured.
I'm sorry, Stanley, I can't let you go all the way to Nebraska by yourself. It's the holidays.
Get the car, Randy! We're going to Nebraska!
Damn it, Stanley, you had us worried sick! You have to get back to the hospital for a shot!
Oh I know, and if you ask me, they should've built a roof with enough support to land a helicopter.
...and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape now, but if she were in her twenties, she could die.
This whole mess started because we couldn't talk to our boy ourselves.
Okay, lemme see.  Oh, goody! You've got a fever!
Randy, will you put down that camera? We need to figure out what to do.
Don't interrupt me! You always interrupt me when I talk! Can't you see that I--?
Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know how to heal the body spiritually. 
Oh my God, this is gonna be so embarrassing. "Hi, Chris. Hi, Linda. We were just wondering if we could get our porno back." 
Let's get started right away! They could be halfway to L. A. by now.
Randy, could you have a talk with Stanley?
I've always thought about murdering you in your sleep. Can you go to the cabin and get in bed?
So, what Broadway show do you think is coming to Denver next?
See boys, a woman is sensitive in her vagina and it... feels good to have a man's penis inside of it.
That's very mature of you, Stanley. Goodnight, sweetie. 
You men are all alike. First you get a cookie and then you criticize the way I dress and then it's the way I cook! I suppose next you'll be telling me that you need your space and that I'm sabotaging your creativity. Go ahead, Stanley, get your God-damned cookie! 
Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay?
You know, to be honest, I can't remember?
Thanks for having us all over for dinner, Chris and Linda.
All right Randy, where are the car keys?!  Randy, where are the keys to the car?!  God damn it! 
I'd never seen any of those men, Officer Barbrady.
Oh, dear. It really was Stan's fish that killed those people!
He's not here, hon. He's having a meeting with all the seniors in town at the community center.
Are you all saying that you can go into a dream and take people in that dream into their own dream?
Well, I don't know what got into you kids. You should be ashamed of yourselves. 
Yes. I should have known. It all makes sense now. I could never get Stanley to pay attention when his grandfather told him stories about the '30s.
A stranger was caught trying to abduct the Tweak boy.
Don't you worry, Stanley, you're going to be okay.
No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what Battle of the Network Stars did to an entire generation.
I don't need to look good to keep your father interested in me! I'm just going to do it FOR ME!
Don't you see what this sport has done to your father? Do you want to end up like him?
Well then stop being an idiot and help!
Wait a minute... Wait a minute, I think I know the answer! I know how to get our kids to stop liking Chinpokomon! 
Randy, will you please come get my wedding ring out of the sink?
Stanley, can I get you anything else?  Stanley? Oh my God! Randy?! Randy, hurry, he's burning up!
No that... that came from me; just put it away.
But she was actually still pregnant with the baby boy and it farted inside her.
Well, nice going, Randy! Really great advice you gave our son here!
Would you do me a favor? Next time you want to scare the hell out of my child, just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead? 
Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People.
Oh I thought that note was for me.
Oh. Uh-Officer Barbrady, Woowhat what a surprise. Wwhat can I do for you?
You're supposed to be keeping watch on the neighborhood.
Uuh uh uh, not so fast. You boys can help bring in the other groceries in the car, then have your chicken.
Stanley, you know you're the most important thing to me, right?
Oh.  This thing is so great. It reminds me when I haven't worked out in a while.
Yes, hon. I had to restrain him so he wouldn't find the bodies in the back yard and take our baby away. 
Oh! Oh, so when does that stop being funny?!
Just go put it back in the trashcan!
All right, it's off to bed with you, young man.
I just can't believe he would go without our permission!
Like I'm a ghost. Like he sees right through me.
Stan's about to go out with his friends.
Yes I do, if it's that stupid Tween Wave garbage!
No, no, little Larry is really making Shelly come out of her shell too.
Yeah, I don't care, I just wanna find out how to return my Shake Weight!
Oh come on! That music sounds like shit!
That's right! We're not raising our son to be an ignorant timecist.
No, Stanley. Cirque du Cheville is French-Canadian. They get acrobats and singers from all over the world and then do very artistic things..
Well, Linda Stotch is a real gossiper and Tammy Bretts at work is just a know-it-all.
Yeah, he must be.  It's like, I just feel he's our son, you know?
All right, Stanley. I have had enough o-  Oh, Stanley, what have you done, baby? What have you done?? 
I was really happy with this month's book. I agree with what Bob and Linda said-
Because ever since your father got that stupid video camera he thinks he has to film everything the family does.
We're sorry, Stanley, we don't want you playing this sport anymore.
Randy, can we just take our son home now?
What is it, honey?  My baby's killed again!
And then the gas from the baby's fart traveled down and shot out her vagina, haHA. 
What do ya mean?! How often does an entire third-grade class go missing?!
Isn't this a nice Christmas, Stanley? No commercialism and shopping, just a nice fire and family.
Are you guys still playing that video game?
Randy, do you mind cleaning up the garage like I asked you?
Well, I... think we... have to,... don't we? 
So then, don't. You don't have to get in fights with other parents at Little League games! Just sit there and watch!
Oh, Randy, I do love you, but- now I'm so confused-uh. I'm living with Roy and-, I don't know how to break it off with him.
That's ridiculous! Musicals don't make me wanna give blowjobs!
I... think I'll start with the smaller white ones.
I don't know how to tell. You tell them. 
I am sick of you belittling my opinion, you son of a bitch! 
Oh! Oh please, Randy! How many times have you farted in bed and held my head under the covers?!
It can't be! I've loved Broadway musicals ever since I saw "Grease" with Jacob Harrison and his brother Kip and we-  Oh my God!
Oh, excuse me, I...  I, I had a little air trapped. 
Hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother. Did Stanley go up there to Nebraska with you?
Stanley, this isn't up for discussion. The rancher is gonna take his cows back and  you don't have a choice!  Stanley! Stanley, you open this door right now or you're gonna get it!
I believe you, sweetheart.  Run from him, boys. Run and don't stop!
Oh. Look, well, you see, Stanley,... Well, your school should be teaching this stuff!
Randy! Gerald! We, we were wrong about heaven! The Japanese just reached it with their ladder!
I can't lie to my son, okay? If I betrayed him like that, I'd pay for it the rest of my life.
I mean it's disgusting.  It's, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever read, but, the plot is amazing. And the characters are so... vivid!
Oh hi, Stanley. Look, I'm buying you some more all-natural toothpaste.
Alright, tell me exactly where the line is. Er, okay, how about this? I have a friend Abbie. She had a baby boy and it farted.
Oh, Stanley, I wish we could take back all the years of abuse, but we can't.
Uh, hold it. Is that a Tween Wave band?
You can't judge the merits of voting on whether or not your candidate won.
I've heard about other towns bringing in counselors that know how to find things out from kids without really telling them what's going on.
Oh my gosh, that's so cute. And so what is little Monica wearing? Oho, I bet she's adorable.  No, we've just sort of been here for the most part. Yeah, are you guys staying in?  You're watching The Thing? Oh that's fun. On Netflix or Hulu? On your Xbox, uh huh. Yeah, no, at some point I'm hoping we can just call it a night and go home.  No, you don't need to send help. Thanks, though. Are you guys getting a lot of trick-or-treaters? Yeah? Oh really?  Oh, Barbara and Michael? Oh yeah. Uh huh. Ha-hang on a second Karen.  Can I help you with something?
It's just that, well, he's been acting a little different lately. 
We excuse me, Sheila, but it wasn't that simple!
I can't believe you said the N-word on national television.
Yes, well, eh you see, son, the time matrix pulled in more people from the future.
Did you have fun at Eric's house today, Stanley?
We talked a lot and, we know it's what's best for you kids and, I don't know...
Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say.
We're sorry boys, but we have all decided that as of now, none of you are allowed to listen to Tween Wave music.
Okay. Wait, no. Why do we need a football player?
Well, he's just getting older, Randy. Maybe he's figured out the Easter bunny isn't real. 
Oh, I'll pass. I don't drink hard alcohol.
That's right. We're a family no matter what time shift.
Look at that thing! Randy, what are we gonna do? 
Stanley, do you know how many people died so you could have the right to vote?!
It's gorgeous, Dad, thank you. Oh, and tomorrow's picture day at school! Stan can wear it for his photo!
Oh, now, what's spooky about a cute, little goldfish? Go put him in your room.
I know that's why you got kicked out of college.
Stop pretending to like the kids' music, Randy! It's pathetic! You know damn well it sounds like crap to you too!
What?? But don't the Native Americans know he has nowhere else to go?
Oh I didn't realize there were different models.
You'll have to come out sooner or later, boys. The longer you wait, the more trouble you'll be in. 
Randy?! I have had it! You are putting down that God damned camera!
Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore.
Oh Randy, I'm so ashamed of our son.
Stanley, what are you doing with those calves?
Don't you need to be getting to work, Rand?
Yyup, it looks like you've got chickenpox alright.
Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over.
Like I have time to go to the gym every day.
Maybe. I guess it's my turn. Truth or Dare?
All right, we're all sufficiently scared, Gerald, but what could we do?
He's been ignoring his homework, and, all of his friends. I can't figure out why.
Well, ...congratulations, guys. Looks like you got us. Good job.
If they spent half the time learning a real instrument as they do playing that game, who knows what they could accomplish.
Alright boys, we need to get to the bottom of this.
Ohhh yeahyeahyeah, these are the paring knives I ordered. Sorry, I think I was a little tipsy.  oh, and this is the book Stan's been wanting; can you take it up to him?
That's right. Anything we like is instantly not cool.  We know how to take them out, Mr. Garrison. Spread the word! Get on the wire to every parent around the country and tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down! 
My son hasn't made any sense in days.
But I would like you to meet your new stepfather, Roy.
Can't you see what's happening?! They're just using that talk to distract you! He doesn't really have a small penis!
Can you believe him?! All this over what guy took the biggest crap!
You said we had to be very careful with our money. I've got nothing for our food budget.
People get older, Stanley. And as you get older you realize... the best thing to do is just... stick with what you know.
Oh, it's just... I was wondering if Stan's okay.
Do you really think we did the right thing, Randy? Sending all the young kids in town to live on their own?
Oh, Stan and Kyle bought a new video game together.
Oh, stop it! Will you all just stop it?!  Look, you guys are carrying this fad too far! Will you please stop acting this way?!
Young man, I have had it! You have disobeyed me for the last time! 
Well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking.
You don't think you can?! This is the biggest game of your son's life! Wny wouldn't you go and support him? What-? 
I gave her those tickets to "Wicked."  She's seeing it with her little boyfriend.
Yes! We were wrong about you. Will you please play for our Halloween party?
I'm really not in the mood now anyway.
Me too. We were lucky to get tickets.  Come on, boys! We're gonna be late. 
Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, it's a personal, woman thing.  I tell you what: If you'll just drop the whole thing right now, I'll buy you that new video game console you've been wanting.
And if anybody needs to potty, there's a potty basket right here. 
Those kids showed up to serve Stan again and he danced back!
Stanley, time for us to get back to the house.
What do you have to say for yourself, Stanley?!
Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny.
Awgh, I guess we have to go talk to 'em now.
Here, Stanley, I made your favorite potato dish. I want you to feel better, okay.
Well, for the time being I, I mean, of course they can stay.
Oh, what a good baby. What a good son I have. 
I'm just saying that your son has some problems a-
Randy, don't you see what this is? You had dreams of being a rock star when you were younger, now you can't admit the next generation's music sounds shitty, it's called "getting older", Randy. It's okay.
I don't know what to do, Sheila. It's like he's a different person. Last night I walked in on him in the bathroom. He was sitting on the toilet flambéing a pork chop.
Randy, we have plenty of video of us eating dinner.
Well, Stan, God and Jesus don't actually speak to people.
Here, Stanley, You watch nice cartoons like Fat Abbot.
Right! I spend all my trying to take care of everybody else!
Stanley, just get your things and come on. We're going home!
Mrs. McCormick, I'm going to have to ask you to leave! You've been drinking!
Oh, hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother.
Oh, he's over at Eric's house practicing for his boy band.
Sure. Come on in. The guys are all watching TV.
All right, each of you take a ticket. When they call your name you can use the Internet.
I'm watching one of Stanley's Chinpokomon video tapes.
Well here, Eric, I baked you a huge box of cookies as a present.
Our son loves this show, Randy, so I think it's important that we watch it to see if it's teaching him good moral values. 
It just makes me feel unwanted, you know? I mean, am I not attractive anymore? I mean I don't exercise anymore at all.
All right, it's late. I'm gonna call it a night.  You coming?
Just using the parental controls to block some channels.
Oho Randy, that's great! I'm really proud of you.
Oh, I'm sorry! I guess I'm wrong again! 
"Cannery Row in Monterey in California-"  "-is a poem, a stink, a grating noise..."  It's amazing how with three images  he puts you right there, and...
Maybe he doesn't remember. He was only 4.
Randy, please. When you get back, do you think maybe we could make love again? 
Wow, the production values are really good in this porno. 
I'm sure a lot of people do, hon. It's pretty exciting, isn't it? Now, you just get some sleep.  You've had a busy day.  Goodnight, sweetie.
D'uh! Aunt Flo, what are you doing up?!
...They are fun.  Boys, you okay out there?
Now, Stanley, I know at your age teachers can seem cold and heartless, but later, you'll understand that he did this for your own good.
Ms. Cartman, this is a battle of wills. We need our boys to know that we're not gonna cave in, at all.
Stan, you came back. Does that mean... you learned the importance of voting?
Oh, yes. I was interested in the Shake Weights?
What is it, Randy? Do you have any-  OH!  Randy!
Yes. Wall-Mart is the leading employer of seniors. And they also employ the handicapped.
We have to see what the news is saying. 
Stanley, do you know why you're being grounded for ten months?
What are we gonna do, baby? What are we gonna do??  I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. 
There, there, Aunt Flo. Stanley loves his goldfish. 
Every senior in town will be driving home...
You know, I'm starting to think this whole metrosexual thing isn't so great.
You haven't heard it? It's terrible! It's hardly even music; it just sounds like crap!
It's crap, Randy! It's so simple and stupid that anybody could play it!
Well, I say we go find them and kick their devil-worshiping butts out of town!
Ladies, get your things! I know what we have to do! 
We are not trying to persecute you kids, but you're supposed to be in school.
No, we are flushing the toilet right now-
You must be exhausted. Why don't you get some sleep?
Oh yes. Our little Stanley is starting to become a man. 
That does it! I can't take it anymore!
Oh, I'm not hot-tubbing. I have nothing to wear.
No, you're not sick. Now get to school.  All of you.
Ooo, these are the contorting quintuplets from Romania. 
Stan, you should be excited. I would love to see the rainforest. Besides, your dad and I need some time alone. 
Boys! You were supposed to come out here and tell everyone about the Founding Fathers!
Now, Stanley! Aunt Flo only visits once a month. Be nice.
"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs"?  "It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find his"...  Ew. "He took a..."  What? Oh. OH! Oh my God! "He then grabbed his dog's"  Ehohoh, oh my God! "Walking out of his house he spotted the bloodiest pus-covered"  Nooo! Nooo!  Noho! Nooo! 
We'll have to call the police and see what they want us to do. 
Go ahead and open it, Stan.  Ohoho look at that! A bolo tie! Isn't that beautiful, Stan? 
Officer Barbrady. What can I do for you?
Sorry Stan, but I need to start doing things for myself! 
Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go.
I don't know. He took his computer somewhere to play that stupid online game.
Yeah, it looks like Western medicine really did the trick.
But why are you back in this time with us, son?
Well sure, Stan.  Wha- How did that thing get there, Randy?
Oh, it's just that I thought that more alone time would maybe be really-
Oh my God! You mean, I just slept with a hologram?
Sshhh. It's okay, honey. It's okay. I've got such a good boy, Mommy's little angel.  Now, don't worry, Stanley. Mommy's going to hide the body.  Nobody's going to take my baby away. I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. 
What the hell do you think you're doing keeping that thing in our house?!
Randy, Randy, you'd better have look at this. 
Stanley, don't you understand what you are doing??
I spoke with the insurance company.  They said we can get some of our money back. Not all of it, but some. You wanna go home? Get changed? Take a shower?
No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown out of games and make an ass of yourself.
No, no, they're just little plastic controllers. You hit the colored buttons and it makes the guitar track on the game play.
Oh Randy,  the bottom line is I love going to those shows. If the fallout from that is I make you really happy for a while, well, I guess they're actually a pretty magical thing.
Ruhur-Randy, it's fine. You do plenty with me. Did you have a good time?
Stanley, you haven't touched your food. What's the matter with you?
I know. I know, Randy, but trust me. You've gotta push through to the end.
Admit it, Randy! You think it sounds like crap too!
Stanley, I think you should know that your father has moved out.
O Randy, I don't wanna put food up my butt anymore.
All right, will you flush the toilet now?! 
I mean it Randy that's enough!! You don't have to videotape every single-!! 
Randy, something's happened. Are you un-able to stop being sarcastic?
Randy, let me handle this. Now Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.
No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school.
Well, I hope for his sake you're right. 
Oh yes, the laundry machine is down in the basement and our son is home. Could you please set the table for dinner? 
Later, sweetie.  Anyway, I found myself enticed by Steinbeck's imagery.
Yes, I see what you mean, Sheila.  That was very impressive.
What should we do, Randy? I like these Romanians fine, but I hope that old woman isn't planning on staying here much longer.
You don't have to do all that now! You can do one more thing and then it's bedtime. 
You just gonna drink beer alone all day?
I don't really like working out in public.
It's all taken care of, Stanley- G'oh!  I've got such a good boy, such a handsome boy! 
Isn't Black Friday supposed to be about buying things for other people?
Randy, aren't you gonna come join your family for dinner?
