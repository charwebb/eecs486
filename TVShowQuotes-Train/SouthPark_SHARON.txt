I've always thought about murdering you in your sleep. Can you go to the cabin and get in bed?

Yes. Wall-Mart is the leading employer of seniors. And they also employ the handicapped.

Please, I don't know where else to turn. The police haven't been any help, ugheh, I think our boys might really be in trouble this time. Yes. Yes. Please, check and call me right back. Thank you.  Randy I swear to God if you don't put that thing away...!

Goodnight.

Boys, I do not want you going over to Mr. Jefferson's anymore. Do you understand?

I gave her those tickets to "Wicked."  She's seeing it with her little boyfriend.

I... well... maybe. 

We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because, honestly, we don't know how to feel.

"Cannery Row in Monterey in California-"  "-is a poem, a stink, a grating noise..."  It's amazing how with three images  he puts you right there, and...

Go!

Bono?! 

Maybe. I guess it's my turn. Truth or Dare?

That does it! I can't take it anymore!

What's the matter?

Well, I guess it serves us right.  Kids, we should have honest about wanting you to get chickenpox.

I'm sorry, I just...

What?

I'm sure a lot of people do, hon. It's pretty exciting, isn't it? Now, you just get some sleep.  You've had a busy day.  Goodnight, sweetie.

Stan, sweetie, we're gonna go to the mall. Do you wanna come?

Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it.

Randy?

Mm, yeah baby.

"Your room is being serviced"? Ugh, oh well.  Uhh, excuse me?

It's... not because I'm older. I'm telling you, our music is better.

Randy?! I have had it! You are putting down that God damned camera!

He's not here, hon. He's having a meeting with all the seniors in town at the community center.

It's a little electrical device that can tell us where you are anywhere on Earth.

Oh Jesus Christ. 

Randy, I don't want our marriage to fail. I don't know how to fix what's wrong, but please, can't we just go to bed and start fresh in the morning?

Go?? The meteor shower hasn't even started yet.

I just wish you'd have talked to me before spending all our money.

Look! There's one of the boys now!  Jimmy!

Stanley, you know you're the most important thing to me, right?

Stanley I want you to understand that even though I won't let you listen to certain kinds of music, I still love you.

Stan, please, come home!

Oh dear God, you've ruined everything.

What a brave little boy.

Those aren't guinea pigs.

Don't you need to be getting to work, Rand?

Wull whattaya mean?

What's that?

That's all gluten!

I'm watching one of Stanley's Chinpokomon video tapes.

That's right. We're a family no matter what time shift.

Don't you see what this sport has done to your father? Do you want to end up like him?

...What did you say?

Hey there, cowboy.

I just can't believe he would go without our permission!

Hey hun.

Look, our kids are learning sexual things on the street and on television. There's no way we can stop it. The schools have to teach them sexual education at a younger age.

Right? It's not just me.

Yehay!

You gonna go back to the kitchen?

There's a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named "Miss Information."

You just said the C-word!

Sheila, who are you talking to?

Oh God, not right now.

Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore.

All right, it's late. I'm gonna call it a night.  You coming?

What?

Well here, Eric, I baked you a huge box of cookies as a present.

Randy? Where are you going? 

No that... that came from me; just put it away.

No, you'r right, Randy. Without any sex we just seem to get madder and madder at each other.

What??

You know, a racist, but against people from the-

Uh, Stanley, take the garbage out before you go to bed.

Ooo, these are the contorting quintuplets from Romania. 

Stanley, honey, what's the matter?

Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say.

But what's wrong with her?

Stanley, I'm in no mood for this! Not when your Aunt Flo is in town! Oh, look, you woke your sister up.  Go to sleep, Stanley! 

Now, Shelly! 

Well it's way past time for bed.

Wwhat??

Congratulations on your victory, boys. 

Hey, time for dinner guys. 

I don't know.

Randy, sit down.

Alright, come to bed soon.

Ruhur-Randy, it's fine. You do plenty with me. Did you have a good time?

I know, but, I'm afraid it's too late for them, sweetie. We have to try and save ourselves now.

We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice. You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat. We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier. But it doesn't.

Yes, hon. I had to restrain him so he wouldn't find the bodies in the back yard and take our baby away. 

Stan, it's Mommy! 

Randy, what are you doing?!

Yes, I see what you mean, Sheila.  That was very impressive.

Oh no.

...So?

Don't interrupt me! You always interrupt me when I talk! Can't you see that I--?

Don't snap at me!

Hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother. Did Stanley go up there to Nebraska with you?

Right! I spend all my trying to take care of everybody else!

What?? Randy, are you serious??

Where are you going?

I don't know. You know, to me, it seems like the mayor of Beaverton should've done something about that dam years ago.

Honestly, I don't see what they find so amusing about those things.

Oh yes. Our little Stanley is starting to become a man. 

The nineteen year old pop star. It's true, that's him.

The answer is "no", Stanley!

Oh. Uh-Officer Barbrady, Woowhat what a surprise. Wwhat can I do for you?

Well, I... think we... have to,... don't we? 

Randy, off the Internet.

You know, I'm starting to think this whole metrosexual thing isn't so great.

Randy, do not watch that no-no channel.

That's right. Anything we like is instantly not cool.  We know how to take them out, Mr. Garrison. Spread the word! Get on the wire to every parent around the country and tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down! 

Let's not make a big deal out of it.

Yyyup!

Now, Stanley, I know at your age teachers can seem cold and heartless, but later, you'll understand that he did this for your own good.

Don't forget the freezer!

Of course not.  Anything to keep you away from cock magic.

All right.  Do you know why young people like Lorde so much.  It's because she's something different. Kids have had pop music artists flash tits and crotch in their face, and most kids are actually smart enough to be sick of it. Lorde represents something in all of us, the truth that wants to be heard. If I could talk to Lorde right now, you know what I'd tell her? I'd tell her not to let people change who she is. I'd tell her that if people are making fun of her, it's probably because they lost touch with being human. I'd tell her to keep on doing what she does, because when someone's not allowed to express who they are inside, then we all lose. That's... what I would say to Lorde. 

Stanley, where have you been?! It's almost bedtime!

So what?

Oh, right, uh. Good bye, Stan. I-I love you. 

Randy? Do you have something to tell me?

Randy, will you put down that camera? We need to figure out what to do.

Go ahead and kill yourself, stupid tar-breath!

RANDY?!
Why?

Stanley, what did you do to Roy?

Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final.

Well, of course you can. Come in out of the snow. 

I was. Can you help me unload the car? 

Ms. Cartman, this is a battle of wills. We need our boys to know that we're not gonna cave in, at all.

Randy please! You've got to listen to me!

Ohhh yeahyeahyeah, these are the paring knives I ordered. Sorry, I think I was a little tipsy.  oh, and this is the book Stan's been wanting; can you take it up to him?

For the love of God!

Please, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son Craig. Do you have any idea where they could've gone?

Randy, something's happened. Are you un-able to stop being sarcastic?

What's wrong with Gerald?

Stanley, just get your things and come on. We're going home!

What?! Randy!

Will my daughter be okay?

What is it, Randy? Do you have any-  OH!  Randy!

I mean it's disgusting.  It's, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever read, but, the plot is amazing. And the characters are so... vivid!

Oh my God! Our son ran away!

WHY?!

Stanley, what are you doing?!

Eric, put that down!

Bullshit.

But why are you back in this time with us, son?

Come on, everybody, let's go. 

Why? Because there's fishnet stockings inside your jeans?

I don't care how long I've had it, I want my money back!

Oh, now, what's spooky about a cute, little goldfish? Go put him in your room.

Hello, Sheila? It's Sharon, Stan's mother. 

Hi, Sheila.

Off chart? What does that mean?

Oh, hi Stan.

Stan? Stanley? You haven't seen your little friend Butters, have you? 

It's sexist, is what it is!

Uh... Where are our children? 

Well, Linda Stotch is a real gossiper and Tammy Bretts at work is just a know-it-all.

Oh I know, and if you ask me, they should've built a roof with enough support to land a helicopter.

Stan, you should be excited. I would love to see the rainforest. Besides, your dad and I need some time alone. 

You have got to be kidding me.

All right, that's all of it!

Sorry, Karen, you were saying? No, it wasn't a customer. No, it's just Randy.  Yes, a customer would have been nice, I know.

Mommy's little boopie-kins 

... You're 42 years old, Randy!

Too young?!

What?? But don't the Native Americans know he has nowhere else to go?

Stanley, do you know why you're being grounded for ten months?

Randy!  What the hell are you doing?

Wait a minute... Wait a minute, I think I know the answer! I know how to get our kids to stop liking Chinpokomon! 

Oh, I'll pass. I don't drink hard alcohol.

And then the gas from the baby's fart traveled down and shot out her vagina, haHA. 

He's not allowed to come out of his room, so you can talk to him through the door.

You ruined my house! 

So it's not such a crazy idea after all?

You men are all alike. First you get a cookie and then you criticize the way I dress and then it's the way I cook! I suppose next you'll be telling me that you need your space and that I'm sabotaging your creativity. Go ahead, Stanley, get your God-damned cookie! 

Yeah. Come on, Sheila, let's go to the nickel slots.

Wwhat?!

Here, Stanley, You watch nice cartoons like Fat Abbot.

Is it them, Randy?

Randy...

Boys! You were supposed to come out here and tell everyone about the Founding Fathers!

Uh adults like documentaries.

Sorry, Stan. you know you're not allowed to listen to this stuff.

Oh, I'm sorry! I guess I'm wrong again! 

What what what what?

Yes. I should have known. It all makes sense now. I could never get Stanley to pay attention when his grandfather told him stories about the '30s.

Mommy misses you.

Did you find it?

Weh, that's nahice.

It's useless. This traffic isn't moving!

Stanley, it's almost eight o'clock. Where have you been?

What?!

Alright boys, we need to get to the bottom of this.

Randy, I'm back.

It's gorgeous, Dad, thank you. Oh, and tomorrow's picture day at school! Stan can wear it for his photo!

You'll have to come out sooner or later, boys. The longer you wait, the more trouble you'll be in. 

That's it, Randy! Turn this car around right now!

Stanley, can I get you anything else?  Stanley? Oh my God! Randy?! Randy, hurry, he's burning up!

Do you really think this is a good idea, Randy?

Can't you see what's happening?! They're just using that talk to distract you! He doesn't really have a small penis!

I was really happy with this month's book. I agree with what Bob and Linda said-

Did you know that your son is supposed to be grounded and he snuck out to go to Red Robin?!

I want to enjoy it too, but... I can't fake it anymore. You just seem kind of shitty to me.

Why? What happened?

How was school?

Oh, it's just... I was wondering if Stan's okay.

I made some quesadillas, if anybody wants some.

S-stanley you don't need to do that. He-he is your future self.

Oh my gosh.

Here, Stanley, I made your favorite potato dish. I want you to feel better, okay.

So then, don't. You don't have to get in fights with other parents at Little League games! Just sit there and watch!

Sorry, it's just ...it's kind of funny how much it bothers you.

Oh, he's over at Eric's house practicing for his boy band.

What the hell are you doing?

I know. I know, Randy, but trust me. You've gotta push through to the end.

Oh I love you, Randy.

We do?

Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

Sshhh. It's okay, honey. It's okay. I've got such a good boy, Mommy's little angel.  Now, don't worry, Stanley. Mommy's going to hide the body.  Nobody's going to take my baby away. I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. 

Why would you wanna do that?

Like I'm a ghost. Like he sees right through me.

I know that's why you got kicked out of college.

Wha? Wha?

People get older, Stanley. And as you get older you realize... the best thing to do is just... stick with what you know.

We are not trying to persecute you kids, but you're supposed to be in school.

Is this the Cartman residence?

It's on! 

Randy!

I don't know! Look at the ingredients!

Oh, Randy, I do love you, but- now I'm so confused-uh. I'm living with Roy and-, I don't know how to break it off with him.

Well, he's just getting older, Randy. Maybe he's figured out the Easter bunny isn't real. 

Uuh uh uh, not so fast. You boys can help bring in the other groceries in the car, then have your chicken.

My son hasn't made any sense in days.

So like a nightmare?

Are you guys still playing that video game?

You must be exhausted. Why don't you get some sleep?

Isn't this a nice Christmas, Stanley? No commercialism and shopping, just a nice fire and family.

What?!

Sorry Stan, but I need to start doing things for myself! 

Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool! Going to multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea!

Oh, Randy!

Oh my gosh, those poor people.

It's too late for games. 

Ooooo, stuff from Amazon?

Why?

Stanley, eat your waffles. 

Randy? What's going on?

It's almost midnight.

But I would like you to meet your new stepfather, Roy.

Alright, tell me exactly where the line is. Er, okay, how about this? I have a friend Abbie. She had a baby boy and it farted.

This is crazy!

Officer Barbrady. What can I do for you?

You think your father's gonna listen to me?! 

Oh I did! That felt really great.

And how about our boys, huh? Ever since gay culture became cool, our boys bathe every night and brush their teeth three times a day. This is the greatest thing ever.

Stanley, how are you feeling today, son?

Ooh, who wants ice cream with their cake?

Like you're one to talk! When's the last time you really listened to what I had to say?!

Thank you, Shake Weight.

Is that really necessary for Stan? It's just his locker.

Aww, Stanley. We just heard the news that your little friend Kenny was killed by a train this morning.

See for yourself!

Well, ...congratulations, guys. Looks like you got us. Good job.

Why?

Ooooo.

We excuse me, Sheila, but it wasn't that simple!

Die?

Stanley??

The news.

Stanley, I didn't know you were miserable.

Just stay down, Shelly. It can't come in here. 

I'll leave you two alone to get acquainted. 

We're sorry.

Well then stop being an idiot and help!

Sexual education. Haven't you learned that yet?

It's okay. We trust that you know what you're doing. 

Okaaay...

Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay?

Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!

You don't have to do all that now! You can do one more thing and then it's bedtime. 

Randy Marsh!

Get up, Randy! Fight! Fight for me!

I don't need to look good to keep your father interested in me! I'm just going to do it FOR ME!

Look! 

What should we do, Randy? I like these Romanians fine, but I hope that old woman isn't planning on staying here much longer.

I spoke with the insurance company.  They said we can get some of our money back. Not all of it, but some. You wanna go home? Get changed? Take a shower?

Well, it is kind of a special night. I guess I could... experiment. 

Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know how to heal the body spiritually. 

Randy, you've been watching that channel, haven't you?!

You see? He's out of control. It's nearly torn our whole family apart.

I... think I'll start with the smaller white ones.

I apologize for this, Mr. rancher person.

Yeah, our son has always been fairly clean.

Whoopee! 

Nono, just keep reading.

Stanley, you haven't touched your food. What's the matter with you?

That doesn't sound very difficult.

There's some spare bedrooms upstairs, Mrs....?

What next dream level?

What are we gonna do, baby? What are we gonna do??  I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. 

You were stimulating the dog, Stanley! What came out of him was his... r-Randy?!

Yeah, her and little Larry Feegan. They're going to see "Wicked" together. It's Shelly's first Broadway musical.

I'm really not in the mood now anyway.

Randy, my wedding ring! I lost it down the garbage disposal!

Oh! 

Randy!  Randy, what are you doing?!

Okay.  Oh my God, you put that sword right through my face!

We'll have to call the police and see what they want us to do. 

Oho, Randy, it's beautiful!

Stanley--

What?

Boys? 

For what?!

I'd never seen any of those men, Officer Barbrady.

No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school.

Well I'm sure Stan wouldn't mind his room, would you, Stan?

Here we go, everyone. I got three nice steaks from South Park Grocery. We'll have to share them.

Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff!

I love you.

Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, it's a personal, woman thing.  I tell you what: If you'll just drop the whole thing right now, I'll buy you that new video game console you've been wanting.

Well, hold on, Randy, I think a turd sandwich is a little better than them having a giant douche on their uniforms.

Well, I don't know what got into you kids. You should be ashamed of yourselves. 

So this is your fault.

That sounds good to me.

Randy? Whose are these?

You have fun, Stanley.

Wow, that's amazing, Miss Information!

Yes? 

Randy, this is ridiculous!

It's going to make you retarded! 

Enough, Stanley!

That's what we're doing, putting our faith in Randy's new musical.

So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox. Let them get it now, while they're young.

Who are you?

Hi boys.

Stop pretending to like the kids' music, Randy! It's pathetic! You know damn well it sounds like crap to you too!

Oh. Look, well, you see, Stanley,... Well, your school should be teaching this stuff!

It's crap, Randy! It's so simple and stupid that anybody could play it!

Yeah, he must be.  It's like, I just feel he's our son, you know?

So, what are we going to do about our children?  Ahhh, hello-o?

No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown out of games and make an ass of yourself.

Isn't Black Friday supposed to be about buying things for other people?

I don't know what to do, Sheila. It's like he's a different person. Last night I walked in on him in the bathroom. He was sitting on the toilet flambéing a pork chop.

Randy, don't!

Oh God, no!

Here you go, boys. 

Randy, we should talk.

Mmm, sounds good.

Yes I do, if it's that stupid Tween Wave garbage!

Don't you worry, Stanley, you're going to be okay.

What's going on?

Of course! That's a great idea!

All right kids, dig in.

What the hell was that?

Oh, gee, I guess you did.

None of the other kids have seen them since a-  Randy, will you put that thing down?! What is wrong with you?! Our son is missing!

You want me to bring you some McDonald's?

How was school today, Stanley?

Randy!

What?! What about Stan?! Is he okay?!

Yes, because every time you watch cooking shows you stay up all night trying to copy what they made.

Can you believe him?! All this over what guy took the biggest crap!

Randy, will you stop doing that?! 

Can huh get th'ere 'or me? 

Looks like you'd better really watch out for marijuana, huh Stan?

Right. Do what you normally would do.

Well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking.

Randy?  Randy! Randy, you need to read this!

Well get over here, big guy.

It just makes me feel unwanted, you know? I mean, am I not attractive anymore? I mean I don't exercise anymore at all.

Well sure, Stan.  Wha- How did that thing get there, Randy?

Me too. We were lucky to get tickets.  Come on, boys! We're gonna be late. 

Oh, hi, Sheila.

What did you say?

Randy, please. When you get back, do you think maybe we could make love again? 

All right, Stanley. I have had enough o-  Oh, Stanley, what have you done, baby? What have you done?? 

It's a long story, Shelly. Let's just say your father... has a lot up his ass right now.

What? Oh my God.

I'll remember that now, thanks to you.

You really should know better, Stanley.

Of course not, go ahead, hun.

So, what Broadway show do you think is coming to Denver next?

I wouldn't worry about that.

Why?

Oh well, that sounds nice.

Randy?

Shake Weight, you aren't really workout equipment at all, are you?

Okay, Stanley. Your turn. 

Stanley, time for us to get back to the house.

Support what?! Another stupid dream of yours?!

Stole? A-a-are you sure? 

Well, Stan, God and Jesus don't actually speak to people.

Oh, look at the funny clown, Stanley.

Oh Mr. Mackey, you nut.

All right, we're all sufficiently scared, Gerald, but what could we do?

We're sorry boys, but we have all decided that as of now, none of you are allowed to listen to Tween Wave music.

Stanley.  Wake up, honey. It's time to leave for Las Vegas. 

Randy, we have plenty of video of us eating dinner.

This is just too much.

No, no, they're just little plastic controllers. You hit the colored buttons and it makes the guitar track on the game play.

Randy, what's wrong??

Ooh, a tampon made from Cherokee hair—now that sounds natural.

Maybe he doesn't remember. He was only 4.

I'm sorry, too.

Bye now. Roy! 

Run away?

I'm just gonna wait up for Shelly.

Stanley, I thought I told you not to watch this horrible cartoon!

What are you doing, sweetheart?

Very persuasive.

Because I want to return it now! I need to know the address of your company.

Stanley?

Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now.

Look at that thing! Randy, what are we gonna do? 

I've heard about other towns bringing in counselors that know how to find things out from kids without really telling them what's going on.

I'm sorry, Stanley, I can't let you go all the way to Nebraska by yourself. It's the holidays.

Pardon me. 

Shelly, off the Internet. It's bedtime.

We talked a lot and, we know it's what's best for you kids and, I don't know...

What are you talking about?

Yes!

Sooo you're doing it? 

That's right, everyone just dig in.  So, kids,anything happen with your whole Sunday off?

And if anybody needs to potty, there's a potty basket right here. 

This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what?

Now, Stanley! Aunt Flo only visits once a month. Be nice.

Wow, the production values are really good in this porno. 

Randy, Randy, you'd better have look at this. 

Randy, what are you doing?!

Oh wow.

You really think women cared that much about queefing? Is that really what you think this has all been about? This has been about women having a little bit of fun for once at your expense. For just this one time we could be the immature ones to make you feel uncomfortable. But no, you just couldn't let us have that one little thing, could you? Because even though things are getting better for women, you still think of us as lesser people sometimes, and we always have to prove ourselves twice as hard. Congratulations, guys.  For getting your way... again. 

No, it can't be! My son is not a filthy smoker! 

There they are! Get 'em!

You snapped at me!

Oh. Well, anyway, here's a pencil and some paper.

Well, it sounds like crap, right?!

Oh, Stanley, where are you..?

Nuh-nn No, this is crazy! Musical theater people are respected. Refined. Cultured.

Go, Stanley!  Ahaha, ahem. Heheh, he, he gets very good grades.

Stan, you came back. Does that mean... you learned the importance of voting?

You were told to walk out in front of a hundred thousand people including little girls who look up to you, and start rubbing your clit.

Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over.

Oh, excuse me, I...  I, I had a little air trapped. 

Oh no, I can't watch! 

Can I try something?

You ate too much acid, man! 

Goodbye, Shake Weight.

Agh!

Shelly, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan.

--you need to come home right now.

It can't be! I've loved Broadway musicals ever since I saw "Grease" with Jacob Harrison and his brother Kip and we-  Oh my God!

The boys! 

Well, I hope for his sake you're right. 

Soo? Randy, it's, it's, it's really good!

Oh my God.

Yes, you do!

It's all taken care of, Stanley- G'oh!  I've got such a good boy, such a handsome boy! 

Not now - my son is not a thief. I'm sure this is just some kind of a misunderstanding.  Stanley, did you see-? 

You bet, you poor dears.

Randy, the storeroom, we've gotta get to the storeroom! 

What is all pee?

Stanley, what the hell are you doing?!

Goodnight, boys. Don't stay up too late.

Fine, Randy!  You go listen to it and tell me you don't think it sounds like crap! 

Why yes, I'd love one, Jimmy. 

Good-bye, son.  Remember to eat right.

That's right! We're not raising our son to be an ignorant timecist.

You have to understand that Kenny's body isn't up in the clouds. He was cremated.

Oh, Linda, huh?

What the hell do you think you're doing keeping that thing in our house?!

We have to see what the news is saying. 

You bet I am.

Randy, will you please come get my wedding ring out of the sink?

Oh I didn't realize there were different models.

Oh, where is that sleep mode button?

Get off the Internet, Stanley, it's time for bed.

It won't take a minute.

Oh my gosh, that's so cute. And so what is little Monica wearing? Oho, I bet she's adorable.  No, we've just sort of been here for the most part. Yeah, are you guys staying in?  You're watching The Thing? Oh that's fun. On Netflix or Hulu? On your Xbox, uh huh. Yeah, no, at some point I'm hoping we can just call it a night and go home.  No, you don't need to send help. Thanks, though. Are you guys getting a lot of trick-or-treaters? Yeah? Oh really?  Oh, Barbara and Michael? Oh yeah. Uh huh. Ha-hang on a second Karen.  Can I help you with something?

STANLEY, YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW!

What'd you say?

Yes, it IS your fault, Randy, because you're a child!

Now Stanley, you have to understand how divorce works. When I say, "you're the most important thing to me," what I mean is, you're the most important thing after me and my happiness and my new romances.

Oh. Stan got served at school today.

Who the hell is that woman, Randy?! What the hell do you think you're doing?!

Randy, I love it! 

I am sick of you belittling my opinion, you son of a bitch! 

Stanley, this isn't up for discussion. The rancher is gonna take his cows back and  you don't have a choice!  Stanley! Stanley, you open this door right now or you're gonna get it!

Well how long have you been feeling this way?

Stanley, what did you do this time?!

Well, now I am worried. I've tried all the houses and nobody knows where they are.

Yeah. Great.

Oh, thanks Shake Weight.

No, you're not sick. Now get to school.  All of you.

Did you have fun at Eric's house today, Stanley?

They, they've got the boys!

Oh yes, the laundry machine is down in the basement and our son is home. Could you please set the table for dinner? 

Sshh. It's going to be okay, Stanley.

Stan?

Randy, Randy, calm down. I can't understand what you're saying.

Why can't you wake up from that?

Stanley, do you know how many people died so you could have the right to vote?!

Hey, dad, I need to talk to you about this party we're having.

Oh Randy, I'm so ashamed of our son.

Well, it looks like our little Stanley has built himself quite a clubhouse here.

Hey guys, it's almost 2 a.m.

Stanley, I think you should know that your father has moved out.

Truth.

I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again.

Well?

Wow.

Randy, slow down! Jesus Christ!

Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny.

Well that makes sense.

Well, the kids at school made you a card, Kyle. Look. 

Yyup, it looks like you've got chickenpox alright.

Randy, I can't get my e-mail to open.

Stanley! 

Okay, sweetie.

I think that's good. Feel tight enough?

All right Randy, where are the car keys?!  Randy, where are the keys to the car?!  God damn it! 

What?

Randy!

This is different!

Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go.

Ladies, get your things! I know what we have to do! 

Yeah. 

I can't believe you said the N-word on national television.

Stanley, it's time to go!

Yes, well, eh you see, son, the time matrix pulled in more people from the future.

Guinea pigs?

All right. Fine. 

He's right. If we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs, then they're never gonna believe anything we tell them

Oh, Randy. What are you doing here? 

Do me. Right here in the clubhouse. 

Ugh, I'm tired.

Ugghh.

Language!

Sorry. I couldn't resist.

Oh hi Gerald, Sheila.

Well, we're supposed to have the Broflovskis and the Stotches over for dinner tonight. Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too.

Oh.  This thing is so great. It reminds me when I haven't worked out in a while.

Stanley, don't you understand what you are doing??

Oh... oh, that's so sweet.

Would you do me a favor? Next time you want to scare the hell out of my child, just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead? 

You do this all the time! First you're obsessed with baseball fights! Then you need to play Warcraft! Then you gotta be a celebrity chef! 

Oh, for the love of God, Randy! 

Sure. Come on in. The guys are all watching TV.

Randy?

Oh my God! Where would they go?!

Oh, yes. I was interested in the Shake Weights?

I'm unhappy too. We both are, obviously. How much longer can we keep doing this? It's like, the same shit just happens over and over and, then in a week it just all resets until- it happens again. Every week it's kind of the same story in a different way but it, it just keeps getting more and more ridiculous.

Randy, why are there drums playing? 

Randy, aren't you gonna come join your family for dinner?

Oooh, you're a little frisky, aren't you?

You don't think you can?! This is the biggest game of your son's life! Wny wouldn't you go and support him? What-? 

Stan, where are you going? 

Randy, it's getting late. Let's just go to sleep.

No, Stanley. Cirque du Cheville is French-Canadian. They get acrobats and singers from all over the world and then do very artistic things..

Stanley, we have some bad news. The courts have decided the girls must go back to Romania.

Oh, Stanley, no! Not Aunt Flo! 

Oh, dear. It really was Stan's fish that killed those people!

Give me that!  Stanley! This is your mother!

Stanley, what did I say about being a smartass?!

Yyes, hon?

It's started.

Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People.

Hello, sweetie. 

And keep it short. He's in real trouble. He defecated in a nice old man's garden.

Ms. Cartman, is your son at home?

Oh, dear!

Nono, I'm good, thanks.

Randy, let him go trick-or-treating.

He's upstairs videotaping your grandfather in the bathtub.

You people are crazy.

Oho Randy, that's great! I'm really proud of you.

Stanley, what are you doing with those calves?

Poor dear must be tired.

Oh, Randy, it's gone! It's all gone!

Randy, don't you see what this is? You had dreams of being a rock star when you were younger, now you can't admit the next generation's music sounds shitty, it's called "getting older", Randy. It's okay.

Okay, wait. Who's Hasselback?

Randy, do you mind cleaning up the garage like I asked you?

WHAT does our son turning 10 have to do with you making the same mistakes again and again?!

Ya think? 

NOW, Stanley! 

What's going on? 

How dare you deceive us like that!

Randy, where are you going?!

I don't know. He took his computer somewhere to play that stupid online game.

There, there, Aunt Flo. Stanley loves his goldfish. 

Just using the parental controls to block some channels.

Make a wish grampa.

There, you did it again!  He interrupted me again.

Not bad. 

Oh God, what have we done?

That's very mature of you, Stanley. Goodnight, sweetie. 

You know, to be honest, I can't remember?

Randy, could you have a talk with Stanley?

Let's see the shield.

What's going on?

What do you want from McDonald's?

Nothing. Come on, Randy. 

I don't know how to tell. You tell them. 

Oh, what a good baby. What a good son I have. 

Oh! Oh, so when does that stop being funny?!

The answer is no, Stanley! Now go wash up for supper!

Then how do you know I blocked them?

Oh Randy, hold me. 

Oh dear. 

Go ahead and open it, Stan.  Ohoho look at that! A bolo tie! Isn't that beautiful, Stan? 

Oh I know! He tried out all his recipes here and left me with the mess!

Oh, stop it! Will you all just stop it?!  Look, you guys are carrying this fad too far! Will you please stop acting this way?!

I've told you what I think of this music, Stanley. You have plenty of other gifts to enjoy.

Soon you'll be old enough to make your own choices, but for now, I just don't want you listening to that stuff.

Oh, Julia's a friend of mine, yeah.

Oh, Stanley, I wish we could take back all the years of abuse, but we can't.

Thanks for having us all over for dinner, Chris and Linda.

Oho, you little devil.

You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it.

You all done with your fishsticks, Stan?

What's so funny, you two?

That's not it, you idiot!

Oh, hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother.

Randy, are you being serious? 

Stan's about to go out with his friends.

I'm just saying that your son has some problems a-

Is the lube over there?

You haven't heard it? It's terrible! It's hardly even music; it just sounds like crap!

Is that so?

Ready.

Will they be able to wake Mackey up?

My son has become a Mongolian? No! Noooo!! 

Well sure, Sheila. Our husbands are all so clean and neat. My Randy irons his clothes and even has pedicures.

Uh, hold it. Is that a Tween Wave band?

Oh, look at our boys, Sheila.  It's just like they're in college again.

I don't really like working out in public.

Can we get out through the highway?

Why are men so obsessed with how big their crap is?!

How are you going to tell her that the singer she's idolized has been you?

Oh my God, first you take me to Wicked and now this?

How do you like your fish, Stanley?

Oh, he's in the back. He set up a video camera so he can tape the performance.

Please, save our boy, Randy.

Yeah, but Dad-

Randy! Marsh!

What did you do?

People get older, Randy. People grow apart.

You can't judge the merits of voting on whether or not your candidate won.

Oh, Stanley. Let's just forget the whole thing and have a nice holiday back home.

I know. 

Awgh, I guess we have to go talk to 'em now.

Randy, what about Shelley?

Stanley, settle down!

Sheila, I was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick?

Oh hi, Stanley. Look, I'm buying you some more all-natural toothpaste.

He's been ignoring his homework, and, all of his friends. I can't figure out why.

That video had pretty colors.

I don't know if I can really be that mad at you for doing something every guy in America does.

Randy, relax. We don't ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment!

I mean it Randy that's enough!! You don't have to videotape every single-!! 

Randy, what's going on?

We don't have to have sex for our relationship to be good.

Just go put it back in the trashcan!

Randy, let me handle this. Now Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.

Stanley! 

D'uh! Aunt Flo, what are you doing up?!

Ms. Cartman, what are you doing?

Yeah, kind of.

You mean Stanley's missing?

Randy, put down that c-! 

...Oh my God. Our son is with those people.

Randy! Randy, will you look at yourself? Your balls are getting bigger.

Randy, don't cause trouble.

Do you really think we did the right thing, Randy? Sending all the young kids in town to live on their own?

Oh, this is so nice. I really needed this.

Young man, I have had it! You have disobeyed me for the last time! 

Yes! We were wrong about you. Will you please play for our Halloween party?

But then that mean..?

But the Bubble Gum Prince wasn't afraid. He knew that the Land of Chocolate was safe forever and ever.  Goodnight my little angel. 

Dad, Stanley needs to see the arts!

That's right.

Your bastard father has visitation rights, and this is his time with you.

Why?!

Well, I say we go find them and kick their devil-worshiping butts out of town!

This book! Our son and his friends wrote it!

You're supposed to be keeping watch on the neighborhood.

Oh my God! I didn't know this was going to become such a big deal.

Well, nice going, Randy! Really great advice you gave our son here!

You wanna just sit here a little more and be frozen?

You lazy jerk! You never do anything around the house! 

What? Why?

Why does it matter?!

All right, it's off to bed with you, young man.

Ohhh, no no nononononono no.

No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what Battle of the Network Stars did to an entire generation.

He went with his friends to that music festival.

...and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape now, but if she were in her twenties, she could die.

What are you talking about?

"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs"?  "It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find his"...  Ew. "He took a..."  What? Oh. OH! Oh my God! "He then grabbed his dog's"  Ehohoh, oh my God! "Walking out of his house he spotted the bloodiest pus-covered"  Nooo! Nooo!  Noho! Nooo! 

No, it's not okay!

Sshh.Hush little baby, don't say a word. Momma's gonna buy you a mockin' birdIf that mockin' bird don't sing, Momma's gonna bury it in the backyard

You're giving my baby guns?

I believe you, sweetheart.  Run from him, boys. Run and don't stop!

It's in the Triscuits too, Randy!

Oh my God, this is gonna be so embarrassing. "Hi, Chris. Hi, Linda. We were just wondering if we could get our porno back." 

Well that's fine! You boys can just stay in there and starve to death. Us parents are going to go to Pizza Shack and have pepperoni pizza and ice cream.

Every senior in town will be driving home...

What ever?! In fifteen years you've never said, "whatever," to me!

What do you say, Shelly?

We're sorry, Stanley, we don't want you playing this sport anymore.

You said we had to be very careful with our money. I've got nothing for our food budget.

Don't our men look

What?

Oh, it's just that I thought that more alone time would maybe be really-

This whole mess started because we couldn't talk to our boy ourselves.

What's going on here?!

Sheila?

Oho that was so much fun! All the costumes and the sets were amazing! I really love the songs. That Stephen Schwartz is a genius! I've got them all stuck in my head.  Hey, that was such a treat. How would you like a little treat? 

You bet, Stanley! 

Get the car, Randy! We're going to Nebraska!

Yeah, I don't care, I just wanna find out how to return my Shake Weight!

Ahhh.

All right, each of you take a ticket. When they call your name you can use the Internet.

Well I'm going to sleep, Randy.

And so that's the situation. Our boys have locked themselves in Stan's room until we can promosie them the calves will live free, in writing.

Yeah, and then we're going to the movies.

If they spent half the time learning a real instrument as they do playing that game, who knows what they could accomplish.

Oh come on! That music sounds like shit!

It's just that, well, he's been acting a little different lately. 

Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and Daddy's book club night, remember?

Now, Stanley. The Internet will be waiting for you in the morning. Off!

But she was actually still pregnant with the baby boy and it farted inside her.

Are you calling me ignorant?!

Like I have time to go to the gym every day.

Language.

Oh, I'm not hot-tubbing. I have nothing to wear.

Oooh, hi Dad.

I can get both of these, yeah!

Yes. Oh... Well, yeah, but-

Sure.

Randy?  Randy, oh my God!

Randy, can we just take our son home now?

O Randy, I don't wanna put food up my butt anymore.

Now get some sleep, baby. Mommy's taken care of everything.

AAAA!

Wha... WAAAAA! 

Now blow out the candles grampa.  Hurray!!!

Right, just like your eyes are kind of far apart. 

A stranger was caught trying to abduct the Tweak boy.

Uh, Stan,  don't you think you're upsetting your future self a little?

Who taught you to talk like that?!

Okay. Wait, no. Why do we need a football player?

Stanley! 

Here you go, sweetheart.

Mrs. McCormick, I'm going to have to ask you to leave! You've been drinking!

That's ridiculous! Musicals don't make me wanna give blowjobs!

Flush the toilet for Christ's sake!

What is it, honey?  My baby's killed again!

Randy! 

See if it started!

Alright, Stanley, this has gone on long enough! Your little game is over!

Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick.

Huh?  Oh. Yeah, it is.  What are they doing here? They can afford to shop at Cherry Creek. 

Go to your room, Stanley! Right now! 

Oh, please yourself!

Well it's just a block of wood and some wheels; I don't think there's that much more you can do with it.

I don't know, Shelly.

No, mister, it's time for night-night.

Oh is that what you think?! That I'm dead?!

Oh Randy,  the bottom line is I love going to those shows. If the fallout from that is I make you really happy for a while, well, I guess they're actually a pretty magical thing.

I'm here, Randy.

Oho, more than a chance. Randy's actually having a meeting right now with Stephen Sondheim.

Yeah, it looks like Western medicine really did the trick.

Where do we go, Randy?

Uhno problem, Aunt Flo.

See boys, a woman is sensitive in her vagina and it... feels good to have a man's penis inside of it.

What do you have to say for yourself, Stanley?!

I can't lie to my son, okay? If I betrayed him like that, I'd pay for it the rest of my life.

How do we fix this, doctor?

I'm telling you, Randy, I think this sport is doing something to your brain.
