Just go put it back in the trashcan!
People get older, Stanley. And as you get older you realize... the best thing to do is just... stick with what you know.
It's a long story, Shelly. Let's just say your father... has a lot up his ass right now.
Oh my gosh, that's so cute. And so what is little Monica wearing? Oho, I bet she's adorable.  No, we've just sort of been here for the most part. Yeah, are you guys staying in?  You're watching The Thing? Oh that's fun. On Netflix or Hulu? On your Xbox, uh huh. Yeah, no, at some point I'm hoping we can just call it a night and go home.  No, you don't need to send help. Thanks, though. Are you guys getting a lot of trick-or-treaters? Yeah? Oh really?  Oh, Barbara and Michael? Oh yeah. Uh huh. Ha-hang on a second Karen.  Can I help you with something?
Oh.  This thing is so great. It reminds me when I haven't worked out in a while.
Nuh-nn No, this is crazy! Musical theater people are respected. Refined. Cultured.
I was really happy with this month's book. I agree with what Bob and Linda said-
He's been ignoring his homework, and, all of his friends. I can't figure out why.
Stanley, do you know how many people died so you could have the right to vote?!
It's okay. We trust that you know what you're doing. 
Well then stop being an idiot and help!
Well, I say we go find them and kick their devil-worshiping butts out of town!
I'm just saying that your son has some problems a-
Ooh, who wants ice cream with their cake?
Randy, please. When you get back, do you think maybe we could make love again? 
Randy! Randy, will you look at yourself? Your balls are getting bigger.
I don't know if I can really be that mad at you for doing something every guy in America does.
Let's get started right away! They could be halfway to L. A. by now.
Don't you worry, Stanley, you're going to be okay.
Would you do me a favor? Next time you want to scare the hell out of my child, just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead? 
You were told to walk out in front of a hundred thousand people including little girls who look up to you, and start rubbing your clit.
Uh, hold it. Is that a Tween Wave band?
Yes. I should have known. It all makes sense now. I could never get Stanley to pay attention when his grandfather told him stories about the '30s.
Oh, Randy, I do love you, but- now I'm so confused-uh. I'm living with Roy and-, I don't know how to break it off with him.
Oh my gosh, yes! They said like 14 people died.
Here, Stanley, I made your favorite potato dish. I want you to feel better, okay.
All right, will you flush the toilet now?! 
My son hasn't made any sense in days.
Stan, you came back. Does that mean... you learned the importance of voting?
What the hell do you think you're doing keeping that thing in our house?!
Did you have fun at Eric's house today, Stanley?
This book! Our son and his friends wrote it!
So then, don't. You don't have to get in fights with other parents at Little League games! Just sit there and watch!
Why? Because there's fishnet stockings inside your jeans?
Randy, I can't get my e-mail to open.
Oh! Oh, so when does that stop being funny?!
I made some quesadillas, if anybody wants some.
Will they be able to wake Mackey up?
Oh, stop it! Will you all just stop it?!  Look, you guys are carrying this fad too far! Will you please stop acting this way?!
Stan's about to go out with his friends.
Well, we're supposed to have the Broflovskis and the Stotches over for dinner tonight. Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too.
...Oh my God. Our son is with those people.
D'uh! Aunt Flo, what are you doing up?!
Randy, will you put down that camera? We need to figure out what to do.
Now get some sleep, baby. Mommy's taken care of everything.
Who the hell is that woman, Randy?! What the hell do you think you're doing?!
This whole mess started because we couldn't talk to our boy ourselves.
You know, to be honest, I can't remember?
Oh come on! That music sounds like shit!
It just makes me feel unwanted, you know? I mean, am I not attractive anymore? I mean I don't exercise anymore at all.
It's a little electrical device that can tell us where you are anywhere on Earth.
Oh, this is so nice. I really needed this.
You said we had to be very careful with our money. I've got nothing for our food budget.
And then the gas from the baby's fart traveled down and shot out her vagina, haHA. 
You men are all alike. First you get a cookie and then you criticize the way I dress and then it's the way I cook! I suppose next you'll be telling me that you need your space and that I'm sabotaging your creativity. Go ahead, Stanley, get your God-damned cookie! 
Well sure, Stan.  Wha- How did that thing get there, Randy?
Well, hold on, Randy, I think a turd sandwich is a little better than them having a giant douche on their uniforms.
We excuse me, Sheila, but it wasn't that simple!
Right, just like your eyes are kind of far apart. 
Randy, it's getting late. Let's just go to sleep.
Randy? Do you have something to tell me?
Stop pretending to like the kids' music, Randy! It's pathetic! You know damn well it sounds like crap to you too!
I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again.
I can't believe you said the N-word on national television.
I don't know what the hell they're talking about.
Stanley, don't you understand what you are doing??
I spoke with the insurance company.  They said we can get some of our money back. Not all of it, but some. You wanna go home? Get changed? Take a shower?
Alright boys, we need to get to the bottom of this.
Oh. Well, anyway, here's a pencil and some paper.
"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs"?  "It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find his"...  Ew. "He took a..."  What? Oh. OH! Oh my God! "He then grabbed his dog's"  Ehohoh, oh my God! "Walking out of his house he spotted the bloodiest pus-covered"  Nooo! Nooo!  Noho! Nooo! 
Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny.
No that... that came from me; just put it away.
All right, it's off to bed with you, young man.
Our son loves this show, Randy, so I think it's important that we watch it to see if it's teaching him good moral values. 
Alright, Stanley, this has gone on long enough! Your little game is over!
What should we do, Randy? I like these Romanians fine, but I hope that old woman isn't planning on staying here much longer.
We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice. You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat. We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier. But it doesn't.
Oh I know! He tried out all his recipes here and left me with the mess!
You don't think you can?! This is the biggest game of your son's life! Wny wouldn't you go and support him? What-? 
Yes, because every time you watch cooking shows you stay up all night trying to copy what they made.
No, you're not sick. Now get to school.  All of you.
S-stanley you don't need to do that. He-he is your future self.
Hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother. Did Stanley go up there to Nebraska with you?
You just gonna drink beer alone all day?
All right, it's late. I'm gonna call it a night.  You coming?
Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff!
Do you really think this is a good idea, Randy?
Wait a minute... Wait a minute, I think I know the answer! I know how to get our kids to stop liking Chinpokomon! 
Oh, Stanley. Let's just forget the whole thing and have a nice holiday back home.
Yeah, her and little Larry Feegan. They're going to see "Wicked" together. It's Shelly's first Broadway musical.
Uuh uh uh, not so fast. You boys can help bring in the other groceries in the car, then have your chicken.
Honestly, I don't see what they find so amusing about those things.
I just wish you'd have talked to me before spending all our money.
Okay, lemme see.  Oh, goody! You've got a fever!
Yes, well, eh you see, son, the time matrix pulled in more people from the future.
Now, Stanley. The Internet will be waiting for you in the morning. Off!
Yes. Too bad it was their last show, or I'd go see it again.
Stanley, it's almost eight o'clock. Where have you been?
Now, Randy, we were the same way once, too. Don't forget that we were both considered hippies back in the '60s.
Oh my God, this is gonna be so embarrassing. "Hi, Chris. Hi, Linda. We were just wondering if we could get our porno back." 
Yeah, I don't care, I just wanna find out how to return my Shake Weight!
I don't need to look good to keep your father interested in me! I'm just going to do it FOR ME!
You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it.
Oh my God, first you take me to Wicked and now this?
Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay?
Aww, Stanley. We just heard the news that your little friend Kenny was killed by a train this morning.
Ladies, get your things! I know what we have to do! 
Mrs. McCormick, I'm going to have to ask you to leave! You've been drinking!
But she was actually still pregnant with the baby boy and it farted inside her.
Oh is that what you think?! That I'm dead?!
Because ever since your father got that stupid video camera he thinks he has to film everything the family does.
WHAT does our son turning 10 have to do with you making the same mistakes again and again?!
I'll leave you two alone to get acquainted. 
I'm really not in the mood now anyway.
Did you know that your son is supposed to be grounded and he snuck out to go to Red Robin?!
We talked a lot and, we know it's what's best for you kids and, I don't know...
Ms. Cartman, this is a battle of wills. We need our boys to know that we're not gonna cave in, at all.
Oh. Uh-Officer Barbrady, Woowhat what a surprise. Wwhat can I do for you?
Oh, I'm sorry! I guess I'm wrong again! 
Wow, the production values are really good in this porno. 
Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now.
Stanley, where have you been?! It's almost bedtime!
You're doing this to try and get to the front of the line on Black Friday, aren't you?
I've told you what I think of this music, Stanley. You have plenty of other gifts to enjoy.
Sorry, it's just ...it's kind of funny how much it bothers you.
Well sure, Sheila. Our husbands are all so clean and neat. My Randy irons his clothes and even has pedicures.
You have to understand that Kenny's body isn't up in the clouds. He was cremated.
Fine, Randy!  You go listen to it and tell me you don't think it sounds like crap! 
I know. I know, Randy, but trust me. You've gotta push through to the end.
No, no, they're just little plastic controllers. You hit the colored buttons and it makes the guitar track on the game play.
Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know how to heal the body spiritually. 
There's a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named "Miss Information."
Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say.
That's it, Randy! Turn this car around right now!
What ever?! In fifteen years you've never said, "whatever," to me!
No, it can't be! My son is not a filthy smoker! 
"Cannery Row in Monterey in California-"  "-is a poem, a stink, a grating noise..."  It's amazing how with three images  he puts you right there, and...
You watch your mouth, Stanley! The Native Americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us!
A stranger was caught trying to abduct the Tweak boy.
Stanley, I think you should know that your father has moved out.
The nineteen year old pop star. It's true, that's him.
Just stay down, Shelly. It can't come in here. 
There, you did it again!  He interrupted me again.
Well, Linda Stotch is a real gossiper and Tammy Bretts at work is just a know-it-all.
Yeah. Come on, Sheila, let's go to the nickel slots.
Stanley, I thought I told you not to watch this horrible cartoon!
Oh my God! I didn't know this was going to become such a big deal.
Randy, you've been watching that channel, haven't you?!
My son has become a Mongolian? No! Noooo!! 
I'm sorry, Stanley, I can't let you go all the way to Nebraska by yourself. It's the holidays.
Can't you see what's happening?! They're just using that talk to distract you! He doesn't really have a small penis!
Randy?  Randy! Randy, you need to read this!
Sure. Come on in. The guys are all watching TV.
Oh, yes. I was interested in the Shake Weights?
You lazy jerk! You never do anything around the house! 
What?? But don't the Native Americans know he has nowhere else to go?
Oh, it's just... I was wondering if Stan's okay.
The answer is no, Stanley! Now go wash up for supper!
Well here, Eric, I baked you a huge box of cookies as a present.
Soon you'll be old enough to make your own choices, but for now, I just don't want you listening to that stuff.
Young man, I have had it! You have disobeyed me for the last time! 
Are you guys still playing that video game?
Like I have time to go to the gym every day.
Your bastard father has visitation rights, and this is his time with you.
Sshh.Hush little baby, don't say a word. Momma's gonna buy you a mockin' birdIf that mockin' bird don't sing, Momma's gonna bury it in the backyard
We have to see what the news is saying. 
Not now - my son is not a thief. I'm sure this is just some kind of a misunderstanding.  Stanley, did you see-? 
Stan, you should be excited. I would love to see the rainforest. Besides, your dad and I need some time alone. 
No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school.
Officer Barbrady. What can I do for you?
Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool! Going to multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea!
I gave her those tickets to "Wicked."  She's seeing it with her little boyfriend.
You'll have to come out sooner or later, boys. The longer you wait, the more trouble you'll be in. 
It's all taken care of, Stanley- G'oh!  I've got such a good boy, such a handsome boy! 
Randy, could you have a talk with Stanley?
Well, I... think we... have to,... don't we? 
...They are fun.  Boys, you okay out there?
Well how long have you been feeling this way?
Stanley.  Wake up, honey. It's time to leave for Las Vegas. 
But the Bubble Gum Prince wasn't afraid. He knew that the Land of Chocolate was safe forever and ever.  Goodnight my little angel. 
That's ridiculous! Musicals don't make me wanna give blowjobs!
Oh Randy, I'm so ashamed of our son.
Oh I know, and if you ask me, they should've built a roof with enough support to land a helicopter.
Randy, relax. We don't ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment!
Well I'm sure Stan wouldn't mind his room, would you, Stan?
Randy, can we just take our son home now?
I don't know how to tell. You tell them. 
Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People.
This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what?
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son Craig. Do you have any idea where they could've gone?
Let's not make a big deal out of it.
We'll have to call the police and see what they want us to do. 
Now Stanley, you have to understand how divorce works. When I say, "you're the most important thing to me," what I mean is, you're the most important thing after me and my happiness and my new romances.
I believe you, sweetheart.  Run from him, boys. Run and don't stop!
Yes, hon. I had to restrain him so he wouldn't find the bodies in the back yard and take our baby away. 
But why are you back in this time with us, son?
Me too. We were lucky to get tickets.  Come on, boys! We're gonna be late. 
Stanley, you know you're the most important thing to me, right?
Right! I spend all my trying to take care of everybody else!
Don't interrupt me! You always interrupt me when I talk! Can't you see that I--?
Oh! Oh please, Randy! How many times have you farted in bed and held my head under the covers?!
But I would like you to meet your new stepfather, Roy.
Huh?  Oh. Yeah, it is.  What are they doing here? They can afford to shop at Cherry Creek. 
I know that's why you got kicked out of college.
He's upstairs videotaping your grandfather in the bathtub.
You're supposed to be keeping watch on the neighborhood.
Every senior in town will be driving home...
It can't be! I've loved Broadway musicals ever since I saw "Grease" with Jacob Harrison and his brother Kip and we-  Oh my God!
Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!
Give me that!  Stanley! This is your mother!
Oh hi, Stanley. Look, I'm buying you some more all-natural toothpaste.
It's gorgeous, Dad, thank you. Oh, and tomorrow's picture day at school! Stan can wear it for his photo!
Boys! You were supposed to come out here and tell everyone about the Founding Fathers!
I don't know what to do, Sheila. It's like he's a different person. Last night I walked in on him in the bathroom. He was sitting on the toilet flambéing a pork chop.
Stanley, just get your things and come on. We're going home!
What is it, Randy? Do you have any-  OH!  Randy!
Randy, let me handle this. Now Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.
Well, Stan, God and Jesus don't actually speak to people.
Of course not.  Anything to keep you away from cock magic.
I can't lie to my son, okay? If I betrayed him like that, I'd pay for it the rest of my life.
So it's not such a crazy idea after all?
Later, sweetie.  Anyway, I found myself enticed by Steinbeck's imagery.
Oh, he's over at Eric's house practicing for his boy band.
Sshhh. It's okay, honey. It's okay. I've got such a good boy, Mommy's little angel.  Now, don't worry, Stanley. Mommy's going to hide the body.  Nobody's going to take my baby away. I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. 
Yeah, and then we're going to the movies.
What do ya mean?! How often does an entire third-grade class go missing?!
Oh, he's in the back. He set up a video camera so he can tape the performance.
Yes, I see what you mean, Sheila.  That was very impressive.
I don't know. You know, to me, it seems like the mayor of Beaverton should've done something about that dam years ago.
Well, nice going, Randy! Really great advice you gave our son here!
Go?? The meteor shower hasn't even started yet.
I mean it's disgusting.  It's, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever read, but, the plot is amazing. And the characters are so... vivid!
Is that really necessary for Stan? It's just his locker.
Well, the kids at school made you a card, Kyle. Look. 
We don't have to have sex for our relationship to be good.
I'm unhappy too. We both are, obviously. How much longer can we keep doing this? It's like, the same shit just happens over and over and, then in a week it just all resets until- it happens again. Every week it's kind of the same story in a different way but it, it just keeps getting more and more ridiculous.
You think your father's gonna listen to me?! 
What do we do, Randy? We can't support our son talking like this, but I, I mean.
Go, Stanley!  Ahaha, ahem. Heheh, he, he gets very good grades.
Well, of course you can. Come in out of the snow. 
Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go.
Shake Weight, you aren't really workout equipment at all, are you?
You want me to bring you some McDonald's?
Randy, Randy, calm down. I can't understand what you're saying.
Hey, dad, I need to talk to you about this party we're having.
Get the car, Randy! We're going to Nebraska!
Are you all saying that you can go into a dream and take people in that dream into their own dream?
Don't you see what this sport has done to your father? Do you want to end up like him?
Okay.  Oh my God, you put that sword right through my face!
Then how do you know I blocked them?
Oh, excuse me, I...  I, I had a little air trapped. 
It's... not because I'm older. I'm telling you, our music is better.
Sheila, I was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick?
Oh yes. Our little Stanley is starting to become a man. 
Randy, do you mind cleaning up the garage like I asked you?
And keep it short. He's in real trouble. He defecated in a nice old man's garden.
What do you have to say for yourself, Stanley?!
All right.  Do you know why young people like Lorde so much.  It's because she's something different. Kids have had pop music artists flash tits and crotch in their face, and most kids are actually smart enough to be sick of it. Lorde represents something in all of us, the truth that wants to be heard. If I could talk to Lorde right now, you know what I'd tell her? I'd tell her not to let people change who she is. I'd tell her that if people are making fun of her, it's probably because they lost touch with being human. I'd tell her to keep on doing what she does, because when someone's not allowed to express who they are inside, then we all lose. That's... what I would say to Lorde. 
Well, it is kind of a special night. I guess I could... experiment. 
Do you really think we did the right thing, Randy? Sending all the young kids in town to live on their own?
To be honest, Mrs. Tucker, we think Craig is bad influence on our boys.
Uh, Stanley, take the garbage out before you go to bed.
You do this all the time! First you're obsessed with baseball fights! Then you need to play Warcraft! Then you gotta be a celebrity chef! 
Damn it, Stanley, you had us worried sick! You have to get back to the hospital for a shot!
Ohhh yeahyeahyeah, these are the paring knives I ordered. Sorry, I think I was a little tipsy.  oh, and this is the book Stan's been wanting; can you take it up to him?
Randy, we have plenty of video of us eating dinner.
He's not here, hon. He's having a meeting with all the seniors in town at the community center.
He went with his friends to that music festival.
Looks like you'd better really watch out for marijuana, huh Stan?
Because I want to return it now! I need to know the address of your company.
Isn't Black Friday supposed to be about buying things for other people?
No, you'r right, Randy. Without any sex we just seem to get madder and madder at each other.
Oh, I'll pass. I don't drink hard alcohol.
You were stimulating the dog, Stanley! What came out of him was his... r-Randy?!
Well, I hope for his sake you're right. 
Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it.
You haven't heard it? It's terrible! It's hardly even music; it just sounds like crap!
I'd never seen any of those men, Officer Barbrady.
Stanley, we have some bad news. The courts have decided the girls must go back to Romania.
Ooh, a tampon made from Cherokee hair—now that sounds natural.
I am sick of you belittling my opinion, you son of a bitch! 
Like you're one to talk! When's the last time you really listened to what I had to say?!
Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and Daddy's book club night, remember?
Look! There's one of the boys now!  Jimmy!
I'm telling you, Randy, I think this sport is doing something to your brain.
Get off the Internet, Stanley, it's time for bed.
Randy, the storeroom, we've gotta get to the storeroom! 
Oh, it's just that I thought that more alone time would maybe be really-
Awgh, I guess we have to go talk to 'em now.
It's just a little weird having people lying to our boy like this.
Well that's fine! You boys can just stay in there and starve to death. Us parents are going to go to Pizza Shack and have pepperoni pizza and ice cream.
What are we gonna do, baby? What are we gonna do??  I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. 
Well, he's just getting older, Randy. Maybe he's figured out the Easter bunny isn't real. 
Oh I thought that note was for me.
Why are men so obsessed with how big their crap is?!
Oh I didn't realize there were different models.
Stanley, you haven't touched your food. What's the matter with you?
So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox. Let them get it now, while they're young.
Stanley, can I get you anything else?  Stanley? Oh my God! Randy?! Randy, hurry, he's burning up!
STANLEY, YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW!
Ooo, these are the contorting quintuplets from Romania. 
Stan? Stanley? You haven't seen your little friend Butters, have you? 
That's what we're doing, putting our faith in Randy's new musical.
Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick.
Isn't this a nice Christmas, Stanley? No commercialism and shopping, just a nice fire and family.
Well, it looks like our little Stanley has built himself quite a clubhouse here.
Boys, I do not want you going over to Mr. Jefferson's anymore. Do you understand?
Admit it, Randy! You think it sounds like crap too!
Yes. Wall-Mart is the leading employer of seniors. And they also employ the handicapped.
Randy, I don't want our marriage to fail. I don't know how to fix what's wrong, but please, can't we just go to bed and start fresh in the morning?
How are you going to tell her that the singer she's idolized has been you?
That's very mature of you, Stanley. Goodnight, sweetie. 
And so that's the situation. Our boys have locked themselves in Stan's room until we can promosie them the calves will live free, in writing.
So, what Broadway show do you think is coming to Denver next?
I mean it Randy that's enough!! You don't have to videotape every single-!! 
I've always thought about murdering you in your sleep. Can you go to the cabin and get in bed?
I know, but, I'm afraid it's too late for them, sweetie. We have to try and save ourselves now.
Here we go, everyone. I got three nice steaks from South Park Grocery. We'll have to share them.
Stanley, what did I say about being a smartass?!
I don't know. He took his computer somewhere to play that stupid online game.
Stanley?! Your father is coming over for visitation! Stan?  Meet me in the clubhouse. 
Stanley, do you know why you're being grounded for ten months?
And if anybody needs to potty, there's a potty basket right here. 
Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final.
Maybe. I guess it's my turn. Truth or Dare?
See boys, a woman is sensitive in her vagina and it... feels good to have a man's penis inside of it.
None of the other kids have seen them since a-  Randy, will you put that thing down?! What is wrong with you?! Our son is missing!
Stanley, time for us to get back to the house.
Well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking.
Stanley, what are you doing with those calves?
I'm watching one of Stanley's Chinpokomon video tapes.
Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore.
Now, Stanley! Aunt Flo only visits once a month. Be nice.
"Your room is being serviced"? Ugh, oh well.  Uhh, excuse me?
Randy?! I have had it! You are putting down that God damned camera!
Oh, wasn't it? I mean, the first sentence: 
That's right. Anything we like is instantly not cool.  We know how to take them out, Mr. Garrison. Spread the word! Get on the wire to every parent around the country and tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down! 
That's right, everyone just dig in.  So, kids,anything happen with your whole Sunday off?
Alright, tell me exactly where the line is. Er, okay, how about this? I have a friend Abbie. She had a baby boy and it farted.
Oh yes, the laundry machine is down in the basement and our son is home. Could you please set the table for dinner? 
I... think I'll start with the smaller white ones.
No, we are flushing the toilet right now-
We're sorry, Stanley, we don't want you playing this sport anymore.
You see? He's out of control. It's nearly torn our whole family apart.
We are not trying to persecute you kids, but you're supposed to be in school.
Oho that was so much fun! All the costumes and the sets were amazing! I really love the songs. That Stephen Schwartz is a genius! I've got them all stuck in my head.  Hey, that was such a treat. How would you like a little treat? 
Oh, what a good baby. What a good son I have. 
Oh. Look, well, you see, Stanley,... Well, your school should be teaching this stuff!
If they spent half the time learning a real instrument as they do playing that game, who knows what they could accomplish.
Okay. Wait, no. Why do we need a football player?
You wanna just sit here a little more and be frozen?
That's right! We're not raising our son to be an ignorant timecist.
Yeah, our son has always been fairly clean.
Oho Randy, that's great! I'm really proud of you.
You don't have to do all that now! You can do one more thing and then it's bedtime. 
Well, ...congratulations, guys. Looks like you got us. Good job.
Randy, Randy, you'd better have look at this. 
Those kids showed up to serve Stan again and he danced back!
Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over.
Yeah, it looks like Western medicine really did the trick.
Shelly, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan.
You really think women cared that much about queefing? Is that really what you think this has all been about? This has been about women having a little bit of fun for once at your expense. For just this one time we could be the immature ones to make you feel uncomfortable. But no, you just couldn't let us have that one little thing, could you? Because even though things are getting better for women, you still think of us as lesser people sometimes, and we always have to prove ourselves twice as hard. Congratulations, guys.  For getting your way... again. 
Look at that thing! Randy, what are we gonna do? 
Oh Randy,  the bottom line is I love going to those shows. If the fallout from that is I make you really happy for a while, well, I guess they're actually a pretty magical thing.
Here, Stanley, You watch nice cartoons like Fat Abbot.
Randy, don't you see what this is? You had dreams of being a rock star when you were younger, now you can't admit the next generation's music sounds shitty, it's called "getting older", Randy. It's okay.
Sorry, Karen, you were saying? No, it wasn't a customer. No, it's just Randy.  Yes, a customer would have been nice, I know.
He's not allowed to come out of his room, so you can talk to him through the door.
I've heard about other towns bringing in counselors that know how to find things out from kids without really telling them what's going on.
Oh, dear. It really was Stan's fish that killed those people!
No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown out of games and make an ass of yourself.
All right Randy, where are the car keys?!  Randy, where are the keys to the car?!  God damn it! 
Well, for the time being I, I mean, of course they can stay.
That's right. We're a family no matter what time shift.
Oh, Stanley, I wish we could take back all the years of abuse, but we can't.
Well, now I am worried. I've tried all the houses and nobody knows where they are.
Yes, it IS your fault, Randy, because you're a child!
Just using the parental controls to block some channels.
Stan, what did I tell you about watching The Osbournes?
You can't judge the merits of voting on whether or not your candidate won.
No, no, little Larry is really making Shelly come out of her shell too.
He's right. If we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs, then they're never gonna believe anything we tell them
Randy, aren't you gonna come join your family for dinner?
Oh, look at our boys, Sheila.  It's just like they're in college again.
Oh, I'm not hot-tubbing. I have nothing to wear.
Sorry, Stan. you know you're not allowed to listen to this stuff.
Oho, more than a chance. Randy's actually having a meeting right now with Stephen Sondheim.
Maybe he doesn't remember. He was only 4.
Stanley, I'm in no mood for this! Not when your Aunt Flo is in town! Oh, look, you woke your sister up.  Go to sleep, Stanley! 
What is it, honey?  My baby's killed again!
You know, I'm starting to think this whole metrosexual thing isn't so great.
Go ahead and open it, Stan.  Ohoho look at that! A bolo tie! Isn't that beautiful, Stan? 
The doctor says that maybe you can go home tomorrow.
O Randy, I don't wanna put food up my butt anymore.
Randy, my wedding ring! I lost it down the garbage disposal!
Randy! Gerald! We, we were wrong about heaven! The Japanese just reached it with their ladder!
Oh, Stan and Kyle bought a new video game together.
All right, each of you take a ticket. When they call your name you can use the Internet.
Oh, right, uh. Good bye, Stan. I-I love you. 
I want to enjoy it too, but... I can't fake it anymore. You just seem kind of shitty to me.
That does it! I can't take it anymore!
Stan, sweetie, we're gonna go to the mall. Do you wanna come?
Well, I guess it serves us right.  Kids, we should have honest about wanting you to get chickenpox.
Uh okay, fine. So you're gonna take my son to a dream within a dream, and then what?
No, Stanley. Cirque du Cheville is French-Canadian. They get acrobats and singers from all over the world and then do very artistic things..
Randy, will you please come get my wedding ring out of the sink?
