You can't judge the merits of voting on whether or not your candidate won.
We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice. You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat. We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier. But it doesn't.
It's gorgeous, Dad, thank you. Oh, and tomorrow's picture day at school! Stan can wear it for his photo!
To be honest, Mrs. Tucker, we think Craig is bad influence on our boys.
S-stanley you don't need to do that. He-he is your future self.
I was. Can you help me unload the car? 
He's not allowed to come out of his room, so you can talk to him through the door.
Oh, alright, but take your grampy with you.
The answer is no, Stanley! Now go wash up for supper!
You were told to walk out in front of a hundred thousand people including little girls who look up to you, and start rubbing your clit.
Stanley, where have you been?! It's almost bedtime!
Randy, will you put down that camera? We need to figure out what to do.
Do you really think this is a good idea, Randy?
"Cannery Row in Monterey in California-"  "-is a poem, a stink, a grating noise..."  It's amazing how with three images  he puts you right there, and...
Oh. Uh-Officer Barbrady, Woowhat what a surprise. Wwhat can I do for you?
Just stay down, Shelly. It can't come in here. 
My son has become a Mongolian? No! Noooo!! 
That's very mature of you, Stanley. Goodnight, sweetie. 
Oh, Stanley, I wish we could take back all the years of abuse, but we can't.
All right, each of you take a ticket. When they call your name you can use the Internet.
All right, we're all sufficiently scared, Gerald, but what could we do?
See boys, a woman is sensitive in her vagina and it... feels good to have a man's penis inside of it.
Thanks for having us all over for dinner, Chris and Linda.
So it's not such a crazy idea after all?
"Your room is being serviced"? Ugh, oh well.  Uhh, excuse me?
This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what?
No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what Battle of the Network Stars did to an entire generation.
All right, will you flush the toilet now?! 
I mean it's disgusting.  It's, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever read, but, the plot is amazing. And the characters are so... vivid!
Stanley, what are you doing with those calves?
Oh, Stan and Kyle bought a new video game together.
I'm just saying that your son has some problems a-
It's a little electrical device that can tell us where you are anywhere on Earth.
Stanley, this isn't up for discussion. The rancher is gonna take his cows back and  you don't have a choice!  Stanley! Stanley, you open this door right now or you're gonna get it!
Stanley, just get your things and come on. We're going home!
Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick.
Yes, because every time you watch cooking shows you stay up all night trying to copy what they made.
What are we gonna do, baby? What are we gonna do??  I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. 
Well, hold on, Randy, I think a turd sandwich is a little better than them having a giant douche on their uniforms.
Nuh-nn No, this is crazy! Musical theater people are respected. Refined. Cultured.
You know, I'm starting to think this whole metrosexual thing isn't so great.
Uh okay, fine. So you're gonna take my son to a dream within a dream, and then what?
Now, Stanley! Aunt Flo only visits once a month. Be nice.
The nineteen year old pop star. It's true, that's him.
It's... not because I'm older. I'm telling you, our music is better.
I've got a surprise for you too, Randy.
I made some quesadillas, if anybody wants some.
I am sick of you belittling my opinion, you son of a bitch! 
Oh my God, first you take me to Wicked and now this?
I was really happy with this month's book. I agree with what Bob and Linda said-
Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now.
Is that really necessary for Stan? It's just his locker.
Oh my gosh, that's so cute. And so what is little Monica wearing? Oho, I bet she's adorable.  No, we've just sort of been here for the most part. Yeah, are you guys staying in?  You're watching The Thing? Oh that's fun. On Netflix or Hulu? On your Xbox, uh huh. Yeah, no, at some point I'm hoping we can just call it a night and go home.  No, you don't need to send help. Thanks, though. Are you guys getting a lot of trick-or-treaters? Yeah? Oh really?  Oh, Barbara and Michael? Oh yeah. Uh huh. Ha-hang on a second Karen.  Can I help you with something?
My son hasn't made any sense in days.
Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know how to heal the body spiritually. 
Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and Daddy's book club night, remember?
This whole mess started because we couldn't talk to our boy ourselves.
How are you going to tell her that the singer she's idolized has been you?
It's just that, well, he's been acting a little different lately. 
Oh.  This thing is so great. It reminds me when I haven't worked out in a while.
Your bastard father has visitation rights, and this is his time with you.
Randy please! You've got to listen to me!
Oh hi, Stanley. Look, I'm buying you some more all-natural toothpaste.
Well that's fine! You boys can just stay in there and starve to death. Us parents are going to go to Pizza Shack and have pepperoni pizza and ice cream.
Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny.
Go, Stanley!  Ahaha, ahem. Heheh, he, he gets very good grades.
Maybe he doesn't remember. He was only 4.
Don't you worry, Stanley, you're going to be okay.
I just can't believe he would go without our permission!
Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool! Going to multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea!
We have to see what the news is saying. 
Stanley?! Your father is coming over for visitation! Stan?  Meet me in the clubhouse. 
...Oh my God. Our son is with those people.
Sure. Come on in. The guys are all watching TV.
Well, it looks like our little Stanley has built himself quite a clubhouse here.
I don't know how to tell. You tell them. 
Ruhur-Randy, it's fine. You do plenty with me. Did you have a good time?
Aww, Stanley. We just heard the news that your little friend Kenny was killed by a train this morning.
Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay?
He's not here, hon. He's having a meeting with all the seniors in town at the community center.
Well sure, Sheila. Our husbands are all so clean and neat. My Randy irons his clothes and even has pedicures.
It's all taken care of, Stanley- G'oh!  I've got such a good boy, such a handsome boy! 
Randy, could you have a talk with Stanley?
Well here, Eric, I baked you a huge box of cookies as a present.
Oh, it's just that I thought that more alone time would maybe be really-
I've told you what I think of this music, Stanley. You have plenty of other gifts to enjoy.
I mean it Randy that's enough!! You don't have to videotape every single-!! 
I can't lie to my son, okay? If I betrayed him like that, I'd pay for it the rest of my life.
Well then stop being an idiot and help!
Oh, stop it! Will you all just stop it?!  Look, you guys are carrying this fad too far! Will you please stop acting this way?!
That's right, everyone just dig in.  So, kids,anything happen with your whole Sunday off?
Sshhh. It's okay, honey. It's okay. I've got such a good boy, Mommy's little angel.  Now, don't worry, Stanley. Mommy's going to hide the body.  Nobody's going to take my baby away. I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. 
That's right! We're not raising our son to be an ignorant timecist.
Oh, it's just... I was wondering if Stan's okay.
Well, the kids at school made you a card, Kyle. Look. 
Oho that was so much fun! All the costumes and the sets were amazing! I really love the songs. That Stephen Schwartz is a genius! I've got them all stuck in my head.  Hey, that was such a treat. How would you like a little treat? 
He's upstairs videotaping your grandfather in the bathtub.
All right, it's off to bed with you, young man.
Oh. Well, anyway, here's a pencil and some paper.
Oh, excuse me, I...  I, I had a little air trapped. 
Oho Randy, that's great! I'm really proud of you.
Oh Randy,  the bottom line is I love going to those shows. If the fallout from that is I make you really happy for a while, well, I guess they're actually a pretty magical thing.
Well, Linda Stotch is a real gossiper and Tammy Bretts at work is just a know-it-all.
Randy, I don't want our marriage to fail. I don't know how to fix what's wrong, but please, can't we just go to bed and start fresh in the morning?
Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it.
What do you have to say for yourself, Stanley?!
Well, I hope for his sake you're right. 
Well sure, Stan.  Wha- How did that thing get there, Randy?
Alright, tell me exactly where the line is. Er, okay, how about this? I have a friend Abbie. She had a baby boy and it farted.
Well how long have you been feeling this way?
So, what are we going to do about our children?  Ahhh, hello-o?
The doctor says that maybe you can go home tomorrow.
Randy, please. When you get back, do you think maybe we could make love again? 
I gave her those tickets to "Wicked."  She's seeing it with her little boyfriend.
All right Randy, where are the car keys?!  Randy, where are the keys to the car?!  God damn it! 
None of the other kids have seen them since a-  Randy, will you put that thing down?! What is wrong with you?! Our son is missing!
Damn it, Stanley, you had us worried sick! You have to get back to the hospital for a shot!
Oh Randy, I'm so ashamed of our son.
Fine, Randy!  You go listen to it and tell me you don't think it sounds like crap! 
Yes, I see what you mean, Sheila.  That was very impressive.
Why? Because there's fishnet stockings inside your jeans?
Like you're one to talk! When's the last time you really listened to what I had to say?!
Alright, Stanley, this has gone on long enough! Your little game is over!
Okay, lemme see.  Oh, goody! You've got a fever!
Hey, dad, I need to talk to you about this party we're having.
Oh! Oh, so when does that stop being funny?!
Would you do me a favor? Next time you want to scare the hell out of my child, just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead? 
Oh my gosh, yes! They said like 14 people died.
Who the hell is that woman, Randy?! What the hell do you think you're doing?!
I just wish you'd have talked to me before spending all our money.
Stan? Stanley? You haven't seen your little friend Butters, have you? 
I know that's why you got kicked out of college.
Well, we're supposed to have the Broflovskis and the Stotches over for dinner tonight. Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too.
Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People.
Later, sweetie.  Anyway, I found myself enticed by Steinbeck's imagery.
You just gonna drink beer alone all day?
There, there, Aunt Flo. Stanley loves his goldfish. 
Ooh, a tampon made from Cherokee hair—now that sounds natural.
Randy, Randy, calm down. I can't understand what you're saying.
Shelly, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan.
Sorry, Karen, you were saying? No, it wasn't a customer. No, it's just Randy.  Yes, a customer would have been nice, I know.
Yes. Too bad it was their last show, or I'd go see it again.
Randy?! I have had it! You are putting down that God damned camera!
We'll have to call the police and see what they want us to do. 
Here we go, everyone. I got three nice steaks from South Park Grocery. We'll have to share them.
Please, I don't know where else to turn. The police haven't been any help, ugheh, I think our boys might really be in trouble this time. Yes. Yes. Please, check and call me right back. Thank you.  Randy I swear to God if you don't put that thing away...!
If they spent half the time learning a real instrument as they do playing that game, who knows what they could accomplish.
Randy! Randy, will you look at yourself? Your balls are getting bigger.
Sorry Stan, but I need to start doing things for myself! 
No, no, little Larry is really making Shelly come out of her shell too.
I don't need to look good to keep your father interested in me! I'm just going to do it FOR ME!
Well, now I am worried. I've tried all the houses and nobody knows where they are.
Randy? Do you have something to tell me?
I don't know. He took his computer somewhere to play that stupid online game.
He's been ignoring his homework, and, all of his friends. I can't figure out why.
Stan's about to go out with his friends.
Can you believe him?! All this over what guy took the biggest crap!
You men are all alike. First you get a cookie and then you criticize the way I dress and then it's the way I cook! I suppose next you'll be telling me that you need your space and that I'm sabotaging your creativity. Go ahead, Stanley, get your God-damned cookie! 
You lazy jerk! You never do anything around the house! 
Stan, you came back. Does that mean... you learned the importance of voting?
Because I want to return it now! I need to know the address of your company.
You're supposed to be keeping watch on the neighborhood.
No, Stanley. Cirque du Cheville is French-Canadian. They get acrobats and singers from all over the world and then do very artistic things..
Sorry, it's just ...it's kind of funny how much it bothers you.
Randy, will you please come get my wedding ring out of the sink?
Are you guys still playing that video game?
I believe you, sweetheart.  Run from him, boys. Run and don't stop!
Oh my God! I didn't know this was going to become such a big deal.
No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school.
"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs"?  "It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find his"...  Ew. "He took a..."  What? Oh. OH! Oh my God! "He then grabbed his dog's"  Ehohoh, oh my God! "Walking out of his house he spotted the bloodiest pus-covered"  Nooo! Nooo!  Noho! Nooo! 
You said we had to be very careful with our money. I've got nothing for our food budget.
No, we are flushing the toilet right now-
And then the gas from the baby's fart traveled down and shot out her vagina, haHA. 
That's right. We're a family no matter what time shift.
I've heard about other towns bringing in counselors that know how to find things out from kids without really telling them what's going on.
Oh, I'm sorry! I guess I'm wrong again! 
Get the car, Randy! We're going to Nebraska!
Don't interrupt me! You always interrupt me when I talk! Can't you see that I--?
You have to understand that Kenny's body isn't up in the clouds. He was cremated.
And how about our boys, huh? Ever since gay culture became cool, our boys bathe every night and brush their teeth three times a day. This is the greatest thing ever.
Randy, I can't get my e-mail to open.
It's a long story, Shelly. Let's just say your father... has a lot up his ass right now.
Oh, this is so nice. I really needed this.
Stan, what did I tell you about watching The Osbournes?
Randy, it's getting late. Let's just go to sleep.
Yyup, it looks like you've got chickenpox alright.
Yeah, our son has always been fairly clean.
So then, don't. You don't have to get in fights with other parents at Little League games! Just sit there and watch!
We're sorry, Stanley, we don't want you playing this sport anymore.
Now, Stanley. The Internet will be waiting for you in the morning. Off!
Wait a minute... Wait a minute, I think I know the answer! I know how to get our kids to stop liking Chinpokomon! 
He's right. If we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs, then they're never gonna believe anything we tell them
Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore.
I'm sorry, Stanley, I can't let you go all the way to Nebraska by yourself. It's the holidays.
Now, Randy, we were the same way once, too. Don't forget that we were both considered hippies back in the '60s.
What do we do, Randy? We can't support our son talking like this, but I, I mean.
Get off the Internet, Stanley, it's time for bed.
Stan, sweetie, we're gonna go to the mall. Do you wanna come?
Ms. Cartman, this is a battle of wills. We need our boys to know that we're not gonna cave in, at all.
Oh, dear. It really was Stan's fish that killed those people!
No, you're not sick. Now get to school.  All of you.
Yeah, I don't care, I just wanna find out how to return my Shake Weight!
You see? He's out of control. It's nearly torn our whole family apart.
Me too. We were lucky to get tickets.  Come on, boys! We're gonna be late. 
What the hell do you think you're doing keeping that thing in our house?!
Oh I didn't realize there were different models.
Stanley, time for us to get back to the house.
Randy, don't you see what this is? You had dreams of being a rock star when you were younger, now you can't admit the next generation's music sounds shitty, it's called "getting older", Randy. It's okay.
That's it, Randy! Turn this car around right now!
Stop pretending to like the kids' music, Randy! It's pathetic! You know damn well it sounds like crap to you too!
Sheila, I was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick?
Ooo, these are the contorting quintuplets from Romania. 
I know, but, I'm afraid it's too late for them, sweetie. We have to try and save ourselves now.
Yeah, he must be.  It's like, I just feel he's our son, you know?
That's right. Anything we like is instantly not cool.  We know how to take them out, Mr. Garrison. Spread the word! Get on the wire to every parent around the country and tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down! 
I'm watching one of Stanley's Chinpokomon video tapes.
Well, it is kind of a special night. I guess I could... experiment. 
Are you all saying that you can go into a dream and take people in that dream into their own dream?
I'll leave you two alone to get acquainted. 
And if anybody needs to potty, there's a potty basket right here. 
Now get some sleep, baby. Mommy's taken care of everything.
Like I'm a ghost. Like he sees right through me.
Right! I spend all my trying to take care of everybody else!
Okay.  Oh my God, you put that sword right through my face!
All right.  Do you know why young people like Lorde so much.  It's because she's something different. Kids have had pop music artists flash tits and crotch in their face, and most kids are actually smart enough to be sick of it. Lorde represents something in all of us, the truth that wants to be heard. If I could talk to Lorde right now, you know what I'd tell her? I'd tell her not to let people change who she is. I'd tell her that if people are making fun of her, it's probably because they lost touch with being human. I'd tell her to keep on doing what she does, because when someone's not allowed to express who they are inside, then we all lose. That's... what I would say to Lorde. 
Well, I... think we... have to,... don't we? 
Now, Stanley, I know at your age teachers can seem cold and heartless, but later, you'll understand that he did this for your own good.
Oh, look at our boys, Sheila.  It's just like they're in college again.
Randy, do you mind cleaning up the garage like I asked you?
There's a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named "Miss Information."
Wow, the production values are really good in this porno. 
You know, a racist, but against people from the-
Randy, Randy, you'd better have look at this. 
I spoke with the insurance company.  They said we can get some of our money back. Not all of it, but some. You wanna go home? Get changed? Take a shower?
Every senior in town will be driving home...
Oh, I'll pass. I don't drink hard alcohol.
Well, nice going, Randy! Really great advice you gave our son here!
All right, Stanley. I have had enough o-  Oh, Stanley, what have you done, baby? What have you done?? 
Randy! Gerald! We, we were wrong about heaven! The Japanese just reached it with their ladder!
Here, Stanley, I made your favorite potato dish. I want you to feel better, okay.
Stanley, can I get you anything else?  Stanley? Oh my God! Randy?! Randy, hurry, he's burning up!
Look! There's one of the boys now!  Jimmy!
I don't care how long I've had it, I want my money back!
Alright boys, we need to get to the bottom of this.
Well, I don't know what got into you kids. You should be ashamed of yourselves. 
We are not trying to persecute you kids, but you're supposed to be in school.
...and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape now, but if she were in her twenties, she could die.
You don't have to do all that now! You can do one more thing and then it's bedtime. 
Yes. Wall-Mart is the leading employer of seniors. And they also employ the handicapped.
I don't know. You know, to me, it seems like the mayor of Beaverton should've done something about that dam years ago.
That's what we're doing, putting our faith in Randy's new musical.
Randy, we have plenty of video of us eating dinner.
Oh, now, what's spooky about a cute, little goldfish? Go put him in your room.
Stanley, I think you should know that your father has moved out.
It can't be! I've loved Broadway musicals ever since I saw "Grease" with Jacob Harrison and his brother Kip and we-  Oh my God!
Don't you need to be getting to work, Rand?
I don't know what to do, Sheila. It's like he's a different person. Last night I walked in on him in the bathroom. He was sitting on the toilet flambéing a pork chop.
Oh my God, this is gonna be so embarrassing. "Hi, Chris. Hi, Linda. We were just wondering if we could get our porno back." 
Soon you'll be old enough to make your own choices, but for now, I just don't want you listening to that stuff.
Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff!
Boys, I do not want you going over to Mr. Jefferson's anymore. Do you understand?
Stanley, you haven't touched your food. What's the matter with you?
We excuse me, Sheila, but it wasn't that simple!
Oh yes, the laundry machine is down in the basement and our son is home. Could you please set the table for dinner? 
I'd never seen any of those men, Officer Barbrady.
Randy, you've been watching that channel, haven't you?!
Well, for the time being I, I mean, of course they can stay.
Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final.
We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because, honestly, we don't know how to feel.
What do ya mean?! How often does an entire third-grade class go missing?!
I... think I'll start with the smaller white ones.
So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox. Let them get it now, while they're young.
I know. I know, Randy, but trust me. You've gotta push through to the end.
Will they be able to wake Mackey up?
Let's not make a big deal out of it.
It's okay. We trust that you know what you're doing. 
That's ridiculous! Musicals don't make me wanna give blowjobs!
Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go.
Oh, Stanley. Let's just forget the whole thing and have a nice holiday back home.
Randy, can we just take our son home now?
Yes, hon. I had to restrain him so he wouldn't find the bodies in the back yard and take our baby away. 
Our son loves this show, Randy, so I think it's important that we watch it to see if it's teaching him good moral values. 
Go ahead and open it, Stan.  Ohoho look at that! A bolo tie! Isn't that beautiful, Stan? 
Just using the parental controls to block some channels.
Stanley, we have some bad news. The courts have decided the girls must go back to Romania.
Oh I thought that note was for me.
Hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother. Did Stanley go up there to Nebraska with you?
Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over.
Don't you see what this sport has done to your father? Do you want to end up like him?
Yeah, her and little Larry Feegan. They're going to see "Wicked" together. It's Shelly's first Broadway musical.
Stanley, do you know how many people died so you could have the right to vote?!
Randy, relax. We don't ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment!
It's just a little weird having people lying to our boy like this.
Well, I say we go find them and kick their devil-worshiping butts out of town!
Oh, wasn't it? I mean, the first sentence: 
Randy, something's happened. Are you un-able to stop being sarcastic?
Look, our kids are learning sexual things on the street and on television. There's no way we can stop it. The schools have to teach them sexual education at a younger age.
Maybe. I guess it's my turn. Truth or Dare?
Because ever since your father got that stupid video camera he thinks he has to film everything the family does.
Not now - my son is not a thief. I'm sure this is just some kind of a misunderstanding.  Stanley, did you see-? 
Oh, right, uh. Good bye, Stan. I-I love you. 
Sorry, Stan. you know you're not allowed to listen to this stuff.
Well, Stan, God and Jesus don't actually speak to people.
I want to enjoy it too, but... I can't fake it anymore. You just seem kind of shitty to me.
Right, just like your eyes are kind of far apart. 
You think your father's gonna listen to me?! 
You must be exhausted. Why don't you get some sleep?
But she was actually still pregnant with the baby boy and it farted inside her.
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son Craig. Do you have any idea where they could've gone?
Huh?  Oh. Yeah, it is.  What are they doing here? They can afford to shop at Cherry Creek. 
Oho, more than a chance. Randy's actually having a meeting right now with Stephen Sondheim.
Just go put it back in the trashcan!
No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown out of games and make an ass of yourself.
Give me that!  Stanley! This is your mother!
This book! Our son and his friends wrote it!
Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say.
Stanley, what did I say about being a smartass?!
Admit it, Randy! You think it sounds like crap too!
Stan, you should be excited. I would love to see the rainforest. Besides, your dad and I need some time alone. 
Look at that thing! Randy, what are we gonna do? 
Why are men so obsessed with how big their crap is?!
You were stimulating the dog, Stanley! What came out of him was his... r-Randy?!
Stanley, do you know why you're being grounded for ten months?
Yes, well, eh you see, son, the time matrix pulled in more people from the future.
Well, ...congratulations, guys. Looks like you got us. Good job.
People get older, Stanley. And as you get older you realize... the best thing to do is just... stick with what you know.
Did you know that your son is supposed to be grounded and he snuck out to go to Red Robin?!
Can't you see what's happening?! They're just using that talk to distract you! He doesn't really have a small penis!
Honestly, I don't see what they find so amusing about those things.
Well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking.
I'm sure a lot of people do, hon. It's pretty exciting, isn't it? Now, you just get some sleep.  You've had a busy day.  Goodnight, sweetie.
Now Stanley, you have to understand how divorce works. When I say, "you're the most important thing to me," what I mean is, you're the most important thing after me and my happiness and my new romances.
Randy?  Randy! Randy, you need to read this!
You don't think you can?! This is the biggest game of your son's life! Wny wouldn't you go and support him? What-? 
Of course not.  Anything to keep you away from cock magic.
Let's get started right away! They could be halfway to L. A. by now.
Yes I do, if it's that stupid Tween Wave garbage!
Awgh, I guess we have to go talk to 'em now.
Oh, yes. I was interested in the Shake Weights?
Yes. I should have known. It all makes sense now. I could never get Stanley to pay attention when his grandfather told him stories about the '30s.
Uh, hold it. Is that a Tween Wave band?
Oh I know! He tried out all his recipes here and left me with the mess!
Go?? The meteor shower hasn't even started yet.
There, you did it again!  He interrupted me again.
Oh, hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother.
You're doing this to try and get to the front of the line on Black Friday, aren't you?
You'll have to come out sooner or later, boys. The longer you wait, the more trouble you'll be in. 
Oh, he's over at Eric's house practicing for his boy band.
Ohhh yeahyeahyeah, these are the paring knives I ordered. Sorry, I think I was a little tipsy.  oh, and this is the book Stan's been wanting; can you take it up to him?
No that... that came from me; just put it away.
Did you have fun at Eric's house today, Stanley?
You haven't heard it? It's terrible! It's hardly even music; it just sounds like crap!
Boys! You were supposed to come out here and tell everyone about the Founding Fathers!
You know, to be honest, I can't remember?
Oh I know, and if you ask me, they should've built a roof with enough support to land a helicopter.
Shake Weight, you aren't really workout equipment at all, are you?
So, what Broadway show do you think is coming to Denver next?
Isn't Black Friday supposed to be about buying things for other people?
Randy, aren't you gonna come join your family for dinner?
Young man, I have had it! You have disobeyed me for the last time! 
Randy, my wedding ring! I lost it down the garbage disposal!
That does it! I can't take it anymore!
We don't have to have sex for our relationship to be good.
You want me to bring you some McDonald's?
I don't know what the hell they're talking about.
You do this all the time! First you're obsessed with baseball fights! Then you need to play Warcraft! Then you gotta be a celebrity chef! 
I don't know if I can really be that mad at you for doing something every guy in America does.
Uh, Stanley, take the garbage out before you go to bed.
No, no, they're just little plastic controllers. You hit the colored buttons and it makes the guitar track on the game play.
Uh, Stan,  don't you think you're upsetting your future self a little?
Yes! We were wrong about you. Will you please play for our Halloween party?
I'm telling you, Randy, I think this sport is doing something to your brain.
A stranger was caught trying to abduct the Tweak boy.
Oh, Randy, I do love you, but- now I'm so confused-uh. I'm living with Roy and-, I don't know how to break it off with him.
Oh, I'm not hot-tubbing. I have nothing to wear.
No, you'r right, Randy. Without any sex we just seem to get madder and madder at each other.
We talked a lot and, we know it's what's best for you kids and, I don't know...
All right, it's late. I'm gonna call it a night.  You coming?
Stanley, it's almost eight o'clock. Where have you been?
What ever?! In fifteen years you've never said, "whatever," to me!
Stanley.  Wake up, honey. It's time to leave for Las Vegas. 
Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, it's a personal, woman thing.  I tell you what: If you'll just drop the whole thing right now, I'll buy you that new video game console you've been wanting.
Oh yes. Our little Stanley is starting to become a man. 
Stanley, you know you're the most important thing to me, right?
Officer Barbrady. What can I do for you?
I don't really like working out in public.
Oh! Oh please, Randy! How many times have you farted in bed and held my head under the covers?!
Looks like you'd better really watch out for marijuana, huh Stan?
No, it can't be! My son is not a filthy smoker! 
And keep it short. He's in real trouble. He defecated in a nice old man's garden.
But why are you back in this time with us, son?
Ladies, get your things! I know what we have to do! 
Yeah, it looks like Western medicine really did the trick.
Stanley, I'm in no mood for this! Not when your Aunt Flo is in town! Oh, look, you woke your sister up.  Go to sleep, Stanley! 
And so that's the situation. Our boys have locked themselves in Stan's room until we can promosie them the calves will live free, in writing.
Yes, it IS your fault, Randy, because you're a child!
Well, he's just getting older, Randy. Maybe he's figured out the Easter bunny isn't real. 
But the Bubble Gum Prince wasn't afraid. He knew that the Land of Chocolate was safe forever and ever.  Goodnight my little angel. 
Oh my God! You mean, I just slept with a hologram?
Sshh.Hush little baby, don't say a word. Momma's gonna buy you a mockin' birdIf that mockin' bird don't sing, Momma's gonna bury it in the backyard
Yeah. Come on, Sheila, let's go to the nickel slots.
Oh for crying out loud, I gave him a great party and that's all he cares about.
You really think women cared that much about queefing? Is that really what you think this has all been about? This has been about women having a little bit of fun for once at your expense. For just this one time we could be the immature ones to make you feel uncomfortable. But no, you just couldn't let us have that one little thing, could you? Because even though things are getting better for women, you still think of us as lesser people sometimes, and we always have to prove ourselves twice as hard. Congratulations, guys.  For getting your way... again. 
I'm unhappy too. We both are, obviously. How much longer can we keep doing this? It's like, the same shit just happens over and over and, then in a week it just all resets until- it happens again. Every week it's kind of the same story in a different way but it, it just keeps getting more and more ridiculous.
Well it's just a block of wood and some wheels; I don't think there's that much more you can do with it.
Randy, let me handle this. Now Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.
