See for yourself!

Ooh, a tampon made from Cherokee hair—now that sounds natural.

We do?

Goodnight, boys. Don't stay up too late.

Randy, put down that c-! 

Looks like you'd better really watch out for marijuana, huh Stan?

No, we are flushing the toilet right now-

It's just a little weird having people lying to our boy like this.

Randy?

Stanley, can I get you anything else?  Stanley? Oh my God! Randy?! Randy, hurry, he's burning up!

Oh, it's just that I thought that more alone time would maybe be really-

Weh, that's nahice.

Oh, that's great news! 

STANLEY, YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW!

Wha? Wha?

What?! Randy!

Randy, why are there drums playing? 

I'm unhappy too. We both are, obviously. How much longer can we keep doing this? It's like, the same shit just happens over and over and, then in a week it just all resets until- it happens again. Every week it's kind of the same story in a different way but it, it just keeps getting more and more ridiculous.

Randy, don't you see what this is? You had dreams of being a rock star when you were younger, now you can't admit the next generation's music sounds shitty, it's called "getting older", Randy. It's okay.

Uh, Stan,  don't you think you're upsetting your future self a little?

Randy?

...So?

Oh, alright, but take your grampy with you.

Who taught you to talk like that?!

Hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother. Did Stanley go up there to Nebraska with you?

Enough, Stanley!

How are you going to tell her that the singer she's idolized has been you?

Go ahead and open it, Stan.  Ohoho look at that! A bolo tie! Isn't that beautiful, Stan? 

Uh adults like documentaries.

Randy, don't!

Can huh get th'ere 'or me? 

My son hasn't made any sense in days.

Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny.

Yeah, I don't care, I just wanna find out how to return my Shake Weight!

You do this all the time! First you're obsessed with baseball fights! Then you need to play Warcraft! Then you gotta be a celebrity chef! 

Well, it sounds like crap, right?!

Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say.

Oho, Randy, it's beautiful!

Well I'm going to sleep, Randy.

"Cannery Row in Monterey in California-"  "-is a poem, a stink, a grating noise..."  It's amazing how with three images  he puts you right there, and...

What?!

Oh, now, what's spooky about a cute, little goldfish? Go put him in your room.

Why are men so obsessed with how big their crap is?!

What are you talking about?

Ahhh.

I apologize for this, Mr. rancher person.

Right. Do what you normally would do.

Oh hi, Stanley. Look, I'm buying you some more all-natural toothpaste.

Off chart? What does that mean?

Oh, Julia's a friend of mine, yeah.

Nothing. Come on, Randy. 

It's gorgeous, Dad, thank you. Oh, and tomorrow's picture day at school! Stan can wear it for his photo!

I'll leave you two alone to get acquainted. 

There's some spare bedrooms upstairs, Mrs....?

Oh dear. 

Don't be a smartass, Stanley.

Alright, come to bed soon.

Boys! You were supposed to come out here and tell everyone about the Founding Fathers!

Wow.

I don't need to look good to keep your father interested in me! I'm just going to do it FOR ME!

Oh. Uh-Officer Barbrady, Woowhat what a surprise. Wwhat can I do for you?

Oh is that what you think?! That I'm dead?!

Would you do me a favor? Next time you want to scare the hell out of my child, just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead? 

What are you talking about?

This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what?

Stanley, honey, what's the matter?

What's so funny, you two?

Oh I didn't realize there were different models.

Hello, Sheila? It's Sharon, Stan's mother. 

Well, the kids at school made you a card, Kyle. Look. 

Randy, let him go trick-or-treating.

We have to see what the news is saying. 

They, they've got the boys!

Shelly, off the Internet. It's bedtime.

Randy?

Maybe he doesn't remember. He was only 4.

Wwhat??

If they spent half the time learning a real instrument as they do playing that game, who knows what they could accomplish.

Stanley?

Oho, more than a chance. Randy's actually having a meeting right now with Stephen Sondheim.

Randy, are you being serious? 

Are you guys still playing that video game?

The answer is "no", Stanley!

Did you have fun at Eric's house today, Stanley?

It won't take a minute.

It's almost midnight.

We'll have to call the police and see what they want us to do. 

I've got a surprise for you too, Randy.

So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox. Let them get it now, while they're young.

Shelly, give your brother his ticket back!

Later, sweetie.  Anyway, I found myself enticed by Steinbeck's imagery.

Stanley, I didn't know you were miserable.

No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what Battle of the Network Stars did to an entire generation.

Sshhh. It's okay, honey. It's okay. I've got such a good boy, Mommy's little angel.  Now, don't worry, Stanley. Mommy's going to hide the body.  Nobody's going to take my baby away. I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. 

Flush the toilet for Christ's sake!

Oh God, what have we done?

Oh, Stanley, I wish we could take back all the years of abuse, but we can't.

I know that's why you got kicked out of college.

He's not here, hon. He's having a meeting with all the seniors in town at the community center.

You don't think you can?! This is the biggest game of your son's life! Wny wouldn't you go and support him? What-? 

Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over.

Okaaay...

Well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking.

And if anybody needs to potty, there's a potty basket right here. 

Bono?! 

Do you really think we did the right thing, Randy? Sending all the young kids in town to live on their own?

All right, Stanley. I have had enough o-  Oh, Stanley, what have you done, baby? What have you done?? 

You see? He's out of control. It's nearly torn our whole family apart.

Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now.

How was school today, Stanley?

We are not trying to persecute you kids, but you're supposed to be in school.

I'm watching one of Stanley's Chinpokomon video tapes.

Will my daughter be okay?

Oh, Randy, it's gone! It's all gone!

I wouldn't worry about that.

That sounds good to me.

Please, save our boy, Randy.

But why are you back in this time with us, son?

Randy, can we just take our son home now?

Randy, what's going on?

Isn't Black Friday supposed to be about buying things for other people?

You know, a racist, but against people from the-

I've always thought about murdering you in your sleep. Can you go to the cabin and get in bed?

He's right. If we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs, then they're never gonna believe anything we tell them

I was really happy with this month's book. I agree with what Bob and Linda said-

Yes. I should have known. It all makes sense now. I could never get Stanley to pay attention when his grandfather told him stories about the '30s.

You gonna go back to the kitchen?

Officer Barbrady. What can I do for you?

Ms. Cartman, this is a battle of wills. We need our boys to know that we're not gonna cave in, at all.

Oh my gosh, yes! They said like 14 people died.

What's that?

See boys, a woman is sensitive in her vagina and it... feels good to have a man's penis inside of it.

Randy, something's happened. Are you un-able to stop being sarcastic?

No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school.

I don't know! Look at the ingredients!

Stanley, don't you understand what you are doing??

I want to enjoy it too, but... I can't fake it anymore. You just seem kind of shitty to me.

I know. 

Isn't this a nice Christmas, Stanley? No commercialism and shopping, just a nice fire and family.

Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff!

Because I want to return it now! I need to know the address of your company.

Ms. Cartman, is your son at home?

Congratulations on your victory, boys. 

He's been ignoring his homework, and, all of his friends. I can't figure out why.

Stanley, I'm talking to you!

Shake Weight, you aren't really workout equipment at all, are you?

Yes, hon. I had to restrain him so he wouldn't find the bodies in the back yard and take our baby away. 

That's very mature of you, Stanley. Goodnight, sweetie. 

Well, I don't know what got into you kids. You should be ashamed of yourselves. 

Oh, where is that sleep mode button?

So what?

Stanley, settle down!

Stan, you should be excited. I would love to see the rainforest. Besides, your dad and I need some time alone. 

Randy, please. When you get back, do you think maybe we could make love again? 

Oh I know, and if you ask me, they should've built a roof with enough support to land a helicopter.

Stanley, what the hell are you doing?!

What should we ask him?

No, no, little Larry is really making Shelly come out of her shell too.

What??

Yes? 

...They are fun.  Boys, you okay out there?

Randy! Gerald! We, we were wrong about heaven! The Japanese just reached it with their ladder!

Randy, my wedding ring! I lost it down the garbage disposal!

Oh, I'll pass. I don't drink hard alcohol.

Maybe. I guess it's my turn. Truth or Dare?

Randy! Randy, will you look at yourself? Your balls are getting bigger.

Ladies, get your things! I know what we have to do! 

Yes. Too bad it was their last show, or I'd go see it again.

Yyyup!

Stanley, do you know how many people died so you could have the right to vote?!

Oh yes, the laundry machine is down in the basement and our son is home. Could you please set the table for dinner? 

Where do we go, Randy?

Your bastard father has visitation rights, and this is his time with you.

This is crazy!

You don't have to do all that now! You can do one more thing and then it's bedtime. 

Stanley, you know you're the most important thing to me, right?

Did you find it?

And so that's the situation. Our boys have locked themselves in Stan's room until we can promosie them the calves will live free, in writing.

Sheila, I was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick?

I'm just gonna wait up for Shelly.

The boys! 

Randy, this is ridiculous!

Oh, dear. It really was Stan's fish that killed those people!

Now get some sleep, baby. Mommy's taken care of everything.

I love you.

Nono, just keep reading.

Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it.

No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown out of games and make an ass of yourself.

Did you know that your son is supposed to be grounded and he snuck out to go to Red Robin?!

Well I'm sure Stan wouldn't mind his room, would you, Stan?

Stanley? Look who's here. Aunt Flo. 

Oh, thanks Shake Weight.

Oh no.

All right, it's off to bed with you, young man.

Randy!

Who are the experts? 

Randy, will you put down that camera? We need to figure out what to do.

Yeah. Come on, Sheila, let's go to the nickel slots.

That's right, everyone just dig in.  So, kids,anything happen with your whole Sunday off?

Oh, hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother.

Yes!

Wwhat?!

No, it's not okay!

Well, Stan, God and Jesus don't actually speak to people.

Of course! That's a great idea!

Why?

Sshh.Hush little baby, don't say a word. Momma's gonna buy you a mockin' birdIf that mockin' bird don't sing, Momma's gonna bury it in the backyard

Sheila, who are you talking to?

I can't believe you said the N-word on national television.

Support what?! Another stupid dream of yours?!

Turn it up.

You bet, Stanley! 

I'll leave it up to your father.

Why?

Like I have time to go to the gym every day.

I made some quesadillas, if anybody wants some.

You're doing this to try and get to the front of the line on Black Friday, aren't you?

Oh Randy, hold me. 

What?

Oh, hi, Sheila.

It's a little electrical device that can tell us where you are anywhere on Earth.

Oh.  This thing is so great. It reminds me when I haven't worked out in a while.

Oh, dear!

Randy, Randy, you'd better have look at this. 

Alright, tell me exactly where the line is. Er, okay, how about this? I have a friend Abbie. She had a baby boy and it farted.

Run away?

Uh, hold it. Is that a Tween Wave band?

Look, our kids are learning sexual things on the street and on television. There's no way we can stop it. The schools have to teach them sexual education at a younger age.

Randy please! You've got to listen to me!

Oh. Stan got served at school today.

All right, it's late. I'm gonna call it a night.  You coming?

Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!

Stan's about to go out with his friends.

Oh! 

All right.  Do you know why young people like Lorde so much.  It's because she's something different. Kids have had pop music artists flash tits and crotch in their face, and most kids are actually smart enough to be sick of it. Lorde represents something in all of us, the truth that wants to be heard. If I could talk to Lorde right now, you know what I'd tell her? I'd tell her not to let people change who she is. I'd tell her that if people are making fun of her, it's probably because they lost touch with being human. I'd tell her to keep on doing what she does, because when someone's not allowed to express who they are inside, then we all lose. That's... what I would say to Lorde. 

What's the matter?

Oh, are they nice people?

Can I try something?

It's okay. We trust that you know what you're doing. 

So, what Broadway show do you think is coming to Denver next?

Oh my God! Our son ran away!

I don't know what to do, Sheila. It's like he's a different person. Last night I walked in on him in the bathroom. He was sitting on the toilet flambéing a pork chop.

I just wish you'd have talked to me before spending all our money.

Of course not, go ahead, hun.

Randy, you've been watching that channel, haven't you?!

A stranger was caught trying to abduct the Tweak boy.

It's crap, Randy! It's so simple and stupid that anybody could play it!

Go!

My turn again.

It's on! 

Ohhh yeahyeahyeah, these are the paring knives I ordered. Sorry, I think I was a little tipsy.  oh, and this is the book Stan's been wanting; can you take it up to him?

Well, I... think we... have to,... don't we? 

You were told to walk out in front of a hundred thousand people including little girls who look up to you, and start rubbing your clit.

Well sure, Stan.  Wha- How did that thing get there, Randy?

Stanley. You?

I've heard about other towns bringing in counselors that know how to find things out from kids without really telling them what's going on.

Dad, Stanley needs to see the arts!

What?!

What kind of job?

None of the other kids have seen them since a-  Randy, will you put that thing down?! What is wrong with you?! Our son is missing!

Okay, wait. Who's Hasselback?

Stanley, how are you feeling today, son?

I don't know. You know, to me, it seems like the mayor of Beaverton should've done something about that dam years ago.

No that... that came from me; just put it away.

Well how long have you been feeling this way?

Well it's just a block of wood and some wheels; I don't think there's that much more you can do with it.

Ooooo, stuff from Amazon?

No, I'm good, thanks. 

What? Why?

Hey guys, it's almost 2 a.m.

Oh my gosh.

To be honest, Mrs. Tucker, we think Craig is bad influence on our boys.

Yes! We were wrong about you. Will you please play for our Halloween party?

What do you say, Shelly?

The doctor says that maybe you can go home tomorrow.

No, it can't be! My son is not a filthy smoker! 

Oh, Linda, huh?

Of course not.  Anything to keep you away from cock magic.

No, you'r right, Randy. Without any sex we just seem to get madder and madder at each other.

Mommy's little boopie-kins 

Why would you wanna do that?

Pardon me. 

We're sorry, Stanley, we don't want you playing this sport anymore.

Randy!

What'd you say?

Just stay down, Shelly. It can't come in here. 

Hey there, cowboy.

I think that's good. Feel tight enough?

Eric, put that down!

Yeah...

I can get both of these, yeah!

All right, will you flush the toilet now?! 

Nono, I'm good, thanks.

What's wrong with Gerald?

There, there, Aunt Flo. Stanley loves his goldfish. 

There they are! Get 'em!

I... well... maybe. 

I'm sorry, Stanley, I can't let you go all the way to Nebraska by yourself. It's the holidays.

Well here, Eric, I baked you a huge box of cookies as a present.

All right, each of you take a ticket. When they call your name you can use the Internet.

Randy?  Randy, oh my God!

Do you mean that?

Make a wish grampa.

Because ever since your father got that stupid video camera he thinks he has to film everything the family does.

Truth.

Shelly, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan.

Stole? A-a-are you sure? 

Oh! Oh please, Randy! How many times have you farted in bed and held my head under the covers?!

Go ahead and kill yourself, stupid tar-breath!

Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore.

Oh, hi Stan.

Sooo you're doing it? 

Stan, where are you going? 

Wow, the production values are really good in this porno. 

Stanley, it's time to go!

This whole mess started because we couldn't talk to our boy ourselves.

It's just that, well, he's been acting a little different lately. 

So, what are we going to do about our children?  Ahhh, hello-o?

Randy, what's wrong??

Stop pretending to like the kids' music, Randy! It's pathetic! You know damn well it sounds like crap to you too!

Do you really think this is a good idea, Randy?

I was. Can you help me unload the car? 

We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because, honestly, we don't know how to feel.

You really think women cared that much about queefing? Is that really what you think this has all been about? This has been about women having a little bit of fun for once at your expense. For just this one time we could be the immature ones to make you feel uncomfortable. But no, you just couldn't let us have that one little thing, could you? Because even though things are getting better for women, you still think of us as lesser people sometimes, and we always have to prove ourselves twice as hard. Congratulations, guys.  For getting your way... again. 

NOW, Stanley! 

Randy? What's going on?

But what's wrong with her?

I just can't believe he would go without our permission!

Don't interrupt me! You always interrupt me when I talk! Can't you see that I--?

Soo? Randy, it's, it's, it's really good!

Like you're one to talk! When's the last time you really listened to what I had to say?!

Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay?

O Randy, I don't wanna put food up my butt anymore.

Randy, I can't get my e-mail to open.

I've told you what I think of this music, Stanley. You have plenty of other gifts to enjoy.

Randy, run! 

It just makes me feel unwanted, you know? I mean, am I not attractive anymore? I mean I don't exercise anymore at all.

Sexual education. Haven't you learned that yet?

I know. I know, Randy, but trust me. You've gotta push through to the end.

It's in the Triscuits too, Randy!

Right, just like your eyes are kind of far apart. 

Uuh uh uh, not so fast. You boys can help bring in the other groceries in the car, then have your chicken.

Okay, Stanley. Your turn. 

I'm sure a lot of people do, hon. It's pretty exciting, isn't it? Now, you just get some sleep.  You've had a busy day.  Goodnight, sweetie.

Yes I do, if it's that stupid Tween Wave garbage!

Oh no, I can't watch! 

You have fun, Stanley.

You mean Stanley's missing?

What should we do, Randy? I like these Romanians fine, but I hope that old woman isn't planning on staying here much longer.

Like I'm a ghost. Like he sees right through me.

It's... not because I'm older. I'm telling you, our music is better.

Thank you, Shake Weight.

Here you go, sweetheart.

Oh, look at our boys, Sheila.  It's just like they're in college again.

Sshh. It's going to be okay, Stanley.

We excuse me, Sheila, but it wasn't that simple!

D'uh! Aunt Flo, what are you doing up?!

Go, Stanley!  Ahaha, ahem. Heheh, he, he gets very good grades.

You wanna just sit here a little more and be frozen?

I am sick of you belittling my opinion, you son of a bitch! 

There's a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named "Miss Information."

Okay. Wait, no. Why do we need a football player?

What did you do?

Not now - my son is not a thief. I'm sure this is just some kind of a misunderstanding.  Stanley, did you see-? 

Oh, please yourself!

What do ya mean?! How often does an entire third-grade class go missing?!

I can't lie to my son, okay? If I betrayed him like that, I'd pay for it the rest of my life.

Go?? The meteor shower hasn't even started yet.

Sorry, it's just ...it's kind of funny how much it bothers you.

WHY?!

That's not it, you idiot!

I believe you, sweetheart.  Run from him, boys. Run and don't stop!

All right Randy, where are the car keys?!  Randy, where are the keys to the car?!  God damn it! 

Well that's fine! You boys can just stay in there and starve to death. Us parents are going to go to Pizza Shack and have pepperoni pizza and ice cream.

What?

What's going on here?!

Who the hell is that woman, Randy?! What the hell do you think you're doing?!

And keep it short. He's in real trouble. He defecated in a nice old man's garden.

There, you did it again!  He interrupted me again.

What is it, honey?  My baby's killed again!

Then how do you know I blocked them?

Please, I don't know where else to turn. The police haven't been any help, ugheh, I think our boys might really be in trouble this time. Yes. Yes. Please, check and call me right back. Thank you.  Randy I swear to God if you don't put that thing away...!

Nuh-nn No, this is crazy! Musical theater people are respected. Refined. Cultured.

Well it's way past time for bed.

What do you have to say for yourself, Stanley?!

Stanley, what did you do this time?!

Randy...

Now, Shelly! 

You bet, you poor dears.

That's right! We're not raising our son to be an ignorant timecist.

Right? It's not just me.

Hi boys.

Right! I spend all my trying to take care of everybody else!

People get older, Stanley. And as you get older you realize... the best thing to do is just... stick with what you know.

Don't our men look

Bye now. Roy! 

...and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape now, but if she were in her twenties, she could die.

We're sorry.

Oho that was so much fun! All the costumes and the sets were amazing! I really love the songs. That Stephen Schwartz is a genius! I've got them all stuck in my head.  Hey, that was such a treat. How would you like a little treat? 

You lazy jerk! You never do anything around the house! 

Goodnight.

I'm sorry, I just...

It's useless. This traffic isn't moving!

Is it them, Randy?

What?

Stanley?! Your father is coming over for visitation! Stan?  Meet me in the clubhouse. 

Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know how to heal the body spiritually. 

What is all pee?

Okay.  Oh my God, you put that sword right through my face!

...Oh my God. Our son is with those people.

Now blow out the candles grampa.  Hurray!!!

Oh my God! I didn't know this was going to become such a big deal.

Please, Mr. Tuong Lu Kim.

Oh. Well, anyway, here's a pencil and some paper.

This is different!

Well sure, Sheila. Our husbands are all so clean and neat. My Randy irons his clothes and even has pedicures.

You have got to be kidding me.

You said we had to be very careful with our money. I've got nothing for our food budget.

Stanley, I thought I told you not to watch this horrible cartoon!

Randy, where are you going?!

Guinea pigs?

Oh, Randy. What are you doing here? 

Stanley, I think you should know that your father has moved out.

Very persuasive.

Yyes, hon?

Oh, no. 

Oh, Stan and Kyle bought a new video game together.

Hi, Sheila.

What?

That does it! I can't take it anymore!

Get off the Internet, Stanley, it's time for bed.

Stan, you came back. Does that mean... you learned the importance of voting?

Hello, sweetie. 

So like a nightmare?

We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice. You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat. We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier. But it doesn't.

Well, for the time being I, I mean, of course they can stay.

Oh... oh, that's so sweet.

S-stanley you don't need to do that. He-he is your future self.

Oh, I'm sorry! I guess I'm wrong again! 

What?? Randy, are you serious??

Yes, because every time you watch cooking shows you stay up all night trying to copy what they made.

You ruined my house! 

Why?!

Randy?! I have had it! You are putting down that God damned camera!

Open this door, now!

Stan, what did I tell you about watching The Osbournes?

Ohhh, no no nononononono no.

Mommy misses you.

Yehay!

Well take it down. It's noisy.

Can't you see what's happening?! They're just using that talk to distract you! He doesn't really have a small penis!

What are we gonna do, baby? What are we gonna do??  I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. 

Ms. Cartman, what are you doing?

All right. Fine. 

Come on, everybody, let's go. 

Oh Randy, I'm so ashamed of our son.

So then, don't. You don't have to get in fights with other parents at Little League games! Just sit there and watch!

Oh God, no!

Young man, I have had it! You have disobeyed me for the last time! 

I don't know.

What??

Hey, dad, I need to talk to you about this party we're having.

Please, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son Craig. Do you have any idea where they could've gone?

A workout? Right now?

He went with his friends to that music festival.

Yes. Oh... Well, yeah, but-

I... think I'll start with the smaller white ones.

But then that mean..?

But she was actually still pregnant with the baby boy and it farted inside her.

Why? What happened?

Uhno problem, Aunt Flo.

Yeah, and then we're going to the movies.

Get up, Randy! Fight! Fight for me!

Randy?  Randy! Randy, you need to read this!

Well, he's just getting older, Randy. Maybe he's figured out the Easter bunny isn't real. 

What do you want from McDonald's?

You have to understand that Kenny's body isn't up in the clouds. He was cremated.

It's started.

Stanley, what did I say about being a smartass?!

For what?!

I'm just saying that your son has some problems a-

Wait a minute... Wait a minute, I think I know the answer! I know how to get our kids to stop liking Chinpokomon! 

That video had pretty colors.

Agh!

You people are crazy.

Yes. I just saw him.

Sure. Come on in. The guys are all watching TV.

Alright boys, we need to get to the bottom of this.

Oh my God! You mean, I just slept with a hologram?

Oho, you little devil.

That's it, Randy! Turn this car around right now!

You'll have to come out sooner or later, boys. The longer you wait, the more trouble you'll be in. 

Oh, this is so nice. I really needed this.

Randy, we should talk.

Yes, well, eh you see, son, the time matrix pulled in more people from the future.

Come on guys, lasagna's ready.

But I would like you to meet your new stepfather, Roy.

Randy, relax. We don't ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment!

You just gonna drink beer alone all day?

Randy, sit down.

Randy, I don't want our marriage to fail. I don't know how to fix what's wrong, but please, can't we just go to bed and start fresh in the morning?

That doesn't sound very difficult.

How do we fix this, doctor?

Okay, sweetie.

Oh Mr. Mackey, you nut.

Too young?!

I don't know what the hell they're talking about.

Randy, don't cause trouble.

I don't know. He took his computer somewhere to play that stupid online game.

You were stimulating the dog, Stanley! What came out of him was his... r-Randy?!

Oh yes. Our little Stanley is starting to become a man. 

Mrs. McCormick, I'm going to have to ask you to leave! You've been drinking!

Well I don't know-

Well, now I am worried. I've tried all the houses and nobody knows where they are.

Randy, do not watch that no-no channel.

I'd never seen any of those men, Officer Barbrady.

Stanley--

Yes, I see what you mean, Sheila.  That was very impressive.

Let's see the shield.

You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it.

Well, hold on, Randy, I think a turd sandwich is a little better than them having a giant douche on their uniforms.

The answer is no, Stanley! Now go wash up for supper!

Randy, will you stop doing that?! 

You bet I am.

Oh, it's just... I was wondering if Stan's okay.

Yes, it IS your fault, Randy, because you're a child!

I didn't say anything.

Uh... Where are our children? 

Well, I say we go find them and kick their devil-worshiping butts out of town!

I'm really not in the mood now anyway.

You ate too much acid, man! 

Don't forget the freezer!

Randy, Randy, calm down. I can't understand what you're saying.

You can't judge the merits of voting on whether or not your candidate won.

WHAT does our son turning 10 have to do with you making the same mistakes again and again?!

This book! Our son and his friends wrote it!

Well, Linda Stotch is a real gossiper and Tammy Bretts at work is just a know-it-all.

It's going to make you retarded! 

Just using the parental controls to block some channels.

Come on, Stanley! 

...What did you say?

Don't snap at me!

Randy? Whose are these?

Those kids showed up to serve Stan again and he danced back!

Can you believe him?! All this over what guy took the biggest crap!

Why?

Aww, Stanley. We just heard the news that your little friend Kenny was killed by a train this morning.

Sorry, Stan. you know you're not allowed to listen to this stuff.

Oh, look at the funny clown, Stanley.

Stanley, just get your things and come on. We're going home!

Well, nice going, Randy! Really great advice you gave our son here!

Those aren't guinea pigs.

"Your room is being serviced"? Ugh, oh well.  Uhh, excuse me?

Hey hun.

Randy! 

The nineteen year old pop star. It's true, that's him.

Stanley, it's almost eight o'clock. Where have you been?

You know, I'm starting to think this whole metrosexual thing isn't so great.

Well get over here, big guy.

What what what what?

... You're 42 years old, Randy!

Randy, aren't you gonna come join your family for dinner?

I spoke with the insurance company.  They said we can get some of our money back. Not all of it, but some. You wanna go home? Get changed? Take a shower?

So this is your fault.

Admit it, Randy! You think it sounds like crap too!

This is just too much.

Whoopee! 

Randy, let me handle this. Now Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.

Yeah, it looks like Western medicine really did the trick.

Oh for crying out loud, I gave him a great party and that's all he cares about.

That was the right thing to do.

It's too late for games. 

Go to your room, Stanley! Right now! 

You're giving my baby guns?

Randy, what about Shelley?

You're right.

Why does it matter?!

How was school?

I'll remember that now, thanks to you.

The news.

Randy, what are you doing?!

Stan?

I don't know if I can really be that mad at you for doing something every guy in America does.

Stanley, eat your waffles. 

Why? Because there's fishnet stockings inside your jeans?

Is that so?

What a brave little boy.

Language.

Thanks for having us all over for dinner, Chris and Linda.

Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

Randy! Marsh!

Well, we're supposed to have the Broflovskis and the Stotches over for dinner tonight. Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too.

Oho Randy, that's great! I'm really proud of you.

You snapped at me!

How do you like your fish, Stanley?

Wull whattaya mean?

Bullshit.

Oh well, that sounds nice.

AAAA!

Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, it's a personal, woman thing.  I tell you what: If you'll just drop the whole thing right now, I'll buy you that new video game console you've been wanting.

Ooo, these are the contorting quintuplets from Romania. 

Well, ...congratulations, guys. Looks like you got us. Good job.

Oh I did! That felt really great.

No, no, she's been perfectly healthy.

Honestly, I don't see what they find so amusing about those things.

Now, Stanley, I know at your age teachers can seem cold and heartless, but later, you'll understand that he did this for your own good.

Randy? Do you have something to tell me?

Our son loves this show, Randy, so I think it's important that we watch it to see if it's teaching him good moral values. 

Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and Daddy's book club night, remember?

No, you're not sick. Now get to school.  All of you.

Stanley, you haven't touched your food. What's the matter with you?

There you go. All set, sweetie?

How dare you deceive us like that!

Oh, stop it! Will you all just stop it?!  Look, you guys are carrying this fad too far! Will you please stop acting this way?!

--you need to come home right now.

Boys? 

Stanley, I'm in no mood for this! Not when your Aunt Flo is in town! Oh, look, you woke your sister up.  Go to sleep, Stanley! 

You think your father's gonna listen to me?! 

Oh, excuse me, I...  I, I had a little air trapped. 

Randy, off the Internet.

Why?

Let's not make a big deal out of it.

That's right. Anything we like is instantly not cool.  We know how to take them out, Mr. Garrison. Spread the word! Get on the wire to every parent around the country and tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down! 

Oh, Randy!

RANDY?!
Stanley, this isn't up for discussion. The rancher is gonna take his cows back and  you don't have a choice!  Stanley! Stanley, you open this door right now or you're gonna get it!

Randy...

Now Stanley, you have to understand how divorce works. When I say, "you're the most important thing to me," what I mean is, you're the most important thing after me and my happiness and my new romances.

Well that makes sense.

Go Randy, run! 

Randy, what is all this? 

You're supposed to be keeping watch on the neighborhood.

What the hell was that?

Hey, time for dinner guys. 

Oh I love you, Randy.

I know, but, I'm afraid it's too late for them, sweetie. We have to try and save ourselves now.

Stanley! 

So it's not such a crazy idea after all?

Now, Stanley! Aunt Flo only visits once a month. Be nice.

Stan, it's Mommy! 

Look! There's one of the boys now!  Jimmy!

Randy, we have plenty of video of us eating dinner.

People get older, Randy. People grow apart.

Is that really necessary for Stan? It's just his locker.

Well, that's good, honey.

You haven't heard it? It's terrible! It's hardly even music; it just sounds like crap!

What is it, Randy? Do you have any-  OH!  Randy!

Ugh, I'm tired.

Ruhur-Randy, it's fine. You do plenty with me. Did you have a good time?

Randy, could you have a talk with Stanley?

Alright, Stanley, this has gone on long enough! Your little game is over!

Ooooo.

Me too. We were lucky to get tickets.  Come on, boys! We're gonna be late. 

What next dream level?

Hahhh.

Randy, I love it! 

Don't you need to be getting to work, Rand?

Well, of course you can. Come in out of the snow. 

Oh my God, this is gonna be so embarrassing. "Hi, Chris. Hi, Linda. We were just wondering if we could get our porno back." 

Oh hi Gerald, Sheila.

You know, to be honest, I can't remember?

Randy Marsh!

Come on! We don't have much time! 

Fine, Randy!  You go listen to it and tell me you don't think it sounds like crap! 

Oh come on! That music sounds like shit!

Stanley, what are you doing?!

Well, it is kind of a special night. I guess I could... experiment. 

You want me to bring you some McDonald's?

Are you all saying that you can go into a dream and take people in that dream into their own dream?

I'm telling you, Randy, I think this sport is doing something to your brain.

Stanley, we have some bad news. The courts have decided the girls must go back to Romania.

Yeah, kind of.

Oooh, you're a little frisky, aren't you?

Wha... WAAAAA! 

Oh Jesus Christ. 

That's all gluten!

Sheila?

You all done with your fishsticks, Stan?

I don't really like working out in public.

Oh God, not right now.

Oh, Stanley. Let's just forget the whole thing and have a nice holiday back home.

Sorry, Karen, you were saying? No, it wasn't a customer. No, it's just Randy.  Yes, a customer would have been nice, I know.

Soon you'll be old enough to make your own choices, but for now, I just don't want you listening to that stuff.

Yeah. Great.

Will they be able to wake Mackey up?

For the love of God!

Stanley, time for us to get back to the house.

Every senior in town will be driving home...

Yeah, but Dad-

Poor dear must be tired.

He's not allowed to come out of his room, so you can talk to him through the door.

I'm here, Randy.

Oh my God.

Here you go, boys. 

Randy, the storeroom, we've gotta get to the storeroom! 

That's ridiculous! Musicals don't make me wanna give blowjobs!

What do we do, Randy? We can't support our son talking like this, but I, I mean.

Get the car, Randy! We're going to Nebraska!

Mm, yeah baby.

Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final.

Oh, gee, I guess you did.

Is this the Cartman residence?

Stan, please, come home!

Stanley, what are you doing with those calves?

I mean it Randy that's enough!! You don't have to videotape every single-!! 

Die?

Oh, he's in the back. He set up a video camera so he can tape the performance.

I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again.

Well then stop being an idiot and help!

He is. 

We're sorry boys, but we have all decided that as of now, none of you are allowed to listen to Tween Wave music.

Sorry. I couldn't resist.

Oh, he's over at Eric's house practicing for his boy band.

Yeah, her and little Larry Feegan. They're going to see "Wicked" together. It's Shelly's first Broadway musical.

Boys, I do not want you going over to Mr. Jefferson's anymore. Do you understand?

And then the gas from the baby's fart traveled down and shot out her vagina, haHA. 

Yeah, he must be.  It's like, I just feel he's our son, you know?

Stanley, where have you been?! It's almost bedtime!

Here, Stanley, You watch nice cartoons like Fat Abbot.

Look at that thing! Randy, what are we gonna do? 

Oh, yes. I was interested in the Shake Weights?

Randy!

Oh. Look, well, you see, Stanley,... Well, your school should be teaching this stuff!

Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People.

Not bad. 

Sure.

Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool! Going to multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea!

We don't have to have sex for our relationship to be good.

Oh I know! He tried out all his recipes here and left me with the mess!

I mean it's disgusting.  It's, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever read, but, the plot is amazing. And the characters are so... vivid!

No, no, they're just little plastic controllers. You hit the colored buttons and it makes the guitar track on the game play.

Oh! Oh, so when does that stop being funny?!

You men are all alike. First you get a cookie and then you criticize the way I dress and then it's the way I cook! I suppose next you'll be telling me that you need your space and that I'm sabotaging your creativity. Go ahead, Stanley, get your God-damned cookie! 

Sorry Stan, but I need to start doing things for myself! 

Oh dear God, you've ruined everything.

No, Stanley. Cirque du Cheville is French-Canadian. They get acrobats and singers from all over the world and then do very artistic things..

Ohohh Randy, it's happening! 

What's going on?

Because, we're divorced, Stanley.

Who are you?

Oh, Randy, I do love you, but- now I'm so confused-uh. I'm living with Roy and-, I don't know how to break it off with him.

Look! 

That's right. We're a family no matter what time shift.

"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs"?  "It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find his"...  Ew. "He took a..."  What? Oh. OH! Oh my God! "He then grabbed his dog's"  Ehohoh, oh my God! "Walking out of his house he spotted the bloodiest pus-covered"  Nooo! Nooo!  Noho! Nooo! 

Give me that!  Stanley! This is your mother!

You must be exhausted. Why don't you get some sleep?

Damn it, Stanley, you had us worried sick! You have to get back to the hospital for a shot!

And how about our boys, huh? Ever since gay culture became cool, our boys bathe every night and brush their teeth three times a day. This is the greatest thing ever.

Why can't you wake up from that?

Ooh, who wants ice cream with their cake?

Oh my gosh, that's so cute. And so what is little Monica wearing? Oho, I bet she's adorable.  No, we've just sort of been here for the most part. Yeah, are you guys staying in?  You're watching The Thing? Oh that's fun. On Netflix or Hulu? On your Xbox, uh huh. Yeah, no, at some point I'm hoping we can just call it a night and go home.  No, you don't need to send help. Thanks, though. Are you guys getting a lot of trick-or-treaters? Yeah? Oh really?  Oh, Barbara and Michael? Oh yeah. Uh huh. Ha-hang on a second Karen.  Can I help you with something?

Oh I thought that note was for me.

I don't know, Shelly.

Randy!  Randy, what are you doing?!

Why yes, I'd love one, Jimmy. 

Randy!  What the hell are you doing?

Wow, that's amazing, Miss Information!

Randy, I'm back.

Okay, lemme see.  Oh, goody! You've got a fever!

Oh, wasn't it? I mean, the first sentence: 

See if it started!

What did you say?

You watch your mouth, Stanley! The Native Americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us!

Oh, right, uh. Good bye, Stan. I-I love you. 

Stanley I want you to understand that even though I won't let you listen to certain kinds of music, I still love you.

Stanley, do you know why you're being grounded for ten months?

Stanley! 

Diamonds.  They're beautiful

Is the lube over there?

Oh, for the love of God, Randy! 

I don't know how to tell. You tell them. 

Oh my God! Where would they go?!

Ex-cuse me.

Oh my God, first you take me to Wicked and now this?

Goodbye, Shake Weight.

But the Bubble Gum Prince wasn't afraid. He knew that the Land of Chocolate was safe forever and ever.  Goodnight my little angel.
