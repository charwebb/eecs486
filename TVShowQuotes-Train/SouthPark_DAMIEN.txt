My arrival shall note the end of the Beginning, the beginning of the End, the new reign of my father! 
Jesus, my father says... he chooses you! He calls you out! Be here at this time tomorrow! Then the terms will be discussed!
Those guys farted on me, and then called me-
I a - pologize for ruining your playground. And turning your friend into a duck-billed platypus. I was doing my father's bidding. I didn't have a choice. 
Here begins the rule of pain! The new domination of...
I guess all the kids are at that fat boy's party.
I have to. My dad's always on the move. 
Bring me Jesus! My wrath shall continue until I speak to Jesus! 
Infidels! I will turn you all into beasts of burden!
Death to the holy! The wrath of the fallen angels now heads for you all! 
Now feel the wrath - of the fallen angels! The plague of night is upon ye.
I don't need acceptance. I'm the Son of Satan! 
Your time on this earth is short. Soon, my father comes.
Wait a minute! Give me a chance. I want to do something special for your party. 
Well, goodbye, guys. It was nice getting to know you.
