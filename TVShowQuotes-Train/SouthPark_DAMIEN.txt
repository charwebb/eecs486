I have to. My dad's always on the move. 
Aaah! Son of Stench! Cursed Ruler of the weak!
I a - pologize for ruining your playground. And turning your friend into a duck-billed platypus. I was doing my father's bidding. I didn't have a choice. 
My arrival shall note the end of the Beginning, the beginning of the End, the new reign of my father! 
Death to the holy! The wrath of the fallen angels now heads for you all! 
I don't need acceptance. I'm the Son of Satan! 
I guess all the kids are at that fat boy's party.
Here begins the rule of pain! The new domination of...
Bring me Jesus! My wrath shall continue until I speak to Jesus! 
Wait a minute! Give me a chance. I want to do something special for your party. 
Infidels! I will turn you all into beasts of burden!
Well, goodbye, guys. It was nice getting to know you. 
Your time on this earth is short. Soon, my father comes.
Those guys farted on me, and then called me-
Jesus, my father says... he chooses you! He calls you out! Be here at this time tomorrow! Then the terms will be discussed!
