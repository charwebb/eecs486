Oh, Steven, it's like it's all happening all over again. 
Steven and I have a condition called "torsonic polarity syndrome." It's a birth defect that's passed on genetically.
Oh, wonderful! Steven, we're goin' to see Tommy again!
Oh, excuse me. A little... difficult to drink with our condition. 
Thank you. Thank you so much for helping us. 
We've tried every avenue to find him,  but, we've never tried the milk company. 
This is the only photo we have of our little Tommy. 
...and so that's when I called out to my husband. I just knew the boy picture on your milk carton was our little Tommy.
I always love when Spring is on the way. Such a fun and inspiring time to decorate. Just like most women out there I've really gotten into queefing lately.  It's a lot of fun and interesting ways we can decorate our queefs and just make them more dynamic for the holidays. What we're gonna do is just... cut out some paper... like... this...  and cut out little stars and little moon shapes,  and we're gonna just... jam those... up... and they have custom simple little sparkles from the hobby stores; they come in... little tube which make them very easy to just...  shoot... right up the ol'... there we are.. And of course you can feel free to add little flowers or maybe some festive Easter grass. But the point is that when we're done we can... let one rip.  See how pretty that was? It's a good thing.
Uh, excuse me, boys, do you know anything about this?
Clyde, it's time to be getting to bed. 
...No, it was foolish for us to get our hopes up.
Yes, I'm so grateful I just wanna cry again.
Oh my God. Oh my God!  Steven! Steven, come quick!
