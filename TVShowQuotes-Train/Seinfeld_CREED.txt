That's from me.
Thanks mom.
Hey, boss, did you find Nemo?
He put some snacks in the freezer for us.
$3.75 a cupcake, actually. $3.67 if you buy a dozen.
To look younger, so the kid doesn't replace you with machines.
No, you have the power to undo it.
I'm really hating this Jim guy!
Do you want me to give it a shot? Just...
I think you two should meet.
I've done some things I'm not proud of.  Committed some atrocities in Vietnam, uh, two years ago.  Princess Cruise Lines.
Here.
I find it offensive.  Au natural, baby.  That's how I like 'em.  Swing low, sweet chariots.
I want a nice cobbler.
Great. [gets up and leaves]
Yeah.
[Dwight pulls over to pick up hitchhiker] Thanks. Playing a little hookey from work today....Oh my god.
Good, good. This carpet's overdue for a good mopping.
The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss?
Thank you very much.
Good night, Mary Beth!
[opens box, pulls out and displays contents] It's a photo of all of us.
[singsong voice] Baby. Hello baby. Here you want to play with this?
Oh, oh that's right! Good work. Thank you very much, sir [shakes hand].
Andrea's the office bitch. You'll get used to her. [introducing himself] Creed.
Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu.  I'm a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there.  We would have caught this.
OK. Hang on just a second.  Let me just settle in and I'll be right back.
[to Oscar] Who do you think did it?
The tall guy got engaged.
Okay.
Hi, hello.
Night
They make a nice couple.
I did it!
I...
Hey, uh, mayo buddy, five dollar tip, you unclog my ears. Okay?
Oh, I steal things all the time. It's just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago. You should see how many supplies I've taken from this place. Honestly, I love stealing things.
Okay, okay. [gasping]
I go to New York all the time, to visit my buddy Frank.  He's a mole person.
Everything's cool, dude.
: I'm not offended by homosexuality.  In the sixties I made love to many many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain.  And it was possible a man slipped in, and there would be no way of knowing.
Screw Meredith, I don't think it's fair to let someone else pick the cake on my birthday.
What a rush! That's all I had to do all year.
Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?
I made a list like this for Congress when I worked in Hollywood in the 50's, they're meaningless.
What size?
When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.
Uh, 6783's also a good time. Less mileage.
I'd like to contribute.
You know, guys, Michael has really incredible decision-making abilities. Michael's really incredible at making decisions.
He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6.  He slides under an 18 wheeler.  Pop.  It snaps right off.
I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower, but you make more money as a leader.
That's crazy. It's crazy.
I'm thirty. Well, in November I'll be thirty.
Sure.  He hired me.  How's he doing?
A wheel wants to spin, Pam.
Hey, what's the crowd like, Danny? Our age?
Hank, his name is Hank.
All right.
[still playing and singing] And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before.
You shut up!
Exactly.
Hey, thanks, ace.
I want pie. I want peach pie.
Creed Bratton, 75 plus division.
All right, all right. Say no more. So, this is how I got squeaky fromme. No small talk. Just show her who's the boss. Just go right in and kiss her.
You don't want to do that.
I like it. It's so peaceful, I've already written like, twelve plays today.
[feeding coins into a vent] I think it's 75 cents.
Really?  I thought you. [both laugh in Michael's earshot]
I am indeed. How'd you know that?
Hehehe, cool. Let's keep this on the QT, okay? I uh, I don't want you to be a dead mamma jamma.
Good work, kid.
Because they're lame.
[wearing headphones and speaking loudly] I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly.
Can I go?
[opens wallet and hands Jim a single bill] There you go.
Well, I really, really, really liked it.
Michael, undo it!
Let's call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days.
Four nights a week, I sleep under my desk, and then three nights I stay at my place in Toronto. They don't know about this job up there. It's a welfare state. Beautiful countries, both of 'em.
Mmmhm.
Jinx. Buy me some Coke.
You want some?
Say, we're gonna ditch this bitch. You in?
No. The blueberry Slurpee pouch.
I feel terrible about Debbie Brown.  She got fired because of Dwight.  So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times.  Why do bad things always happen to the good people?  It's tragic.  Just tragic.
Two grand huh? I know a guy who can turn that into eight hundred dollars. And it's me.
[playing guitar and singing] I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn���t matter. ���Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same���
I know you don���t really exist.
Get her Phyll.
[carrying in clothes on hangers] Oh, I���m saving a fortune on dry cleaning.
Let's reverse engineer this. You're a black singer. Where do you go? Somewhere where you're a novelty. Alaska?
Give it up, he's dead.
[from atop his desk] Creed Bratton is the new manager! [nobody responds]
Listen, I've got the answer.  You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away.
Animals can't feel pain.
That's not why.
Are you out? [Angela hangs up] Pumpkin's out, let's go gang! [they all make a run for the door, Dwight re-enters room with only Angela left]
It's pronounced Ker-nell. It's the highest rank in the military.
Hey, kid--hear you're looking for work.
[drinking from Michael's World's Best Boss mug] See ya tomorrow boss!
Who said that?
I miss Clinton.
My tombstone's already made, thank you.
I remember. I blogged the whole thing.
Oh ho!  Which one is Pam?
[chuckles] I know. Isn't it something?
Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students.
You did good. You did good.
I don't know.
Haven't heard any complaints. Wouldn't care if I did.
I think we all can agree that it's either Gabe or Angela. [flips a coin] It's Angela. Get her, boys.
If that's flashing, then lock me up.
It���s Halloween. That is really, really good timing.
And a happy holiday to you.
Sure.
I don't know, man. I just don't know.
You don't have to do this, Michael.
No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You're they guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you'd see it my way Michael. God Bless you. You're a fine man.
Not cool man. [walks out]
Like to say 'Hi' to my friends in China. [speaks in Chinese]
You tell her it's for Creed. She'll know what that means.
It's thrilling.
Yes, sir.
I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'.
I���m sure it���ll turn up.
I watch you when you sleep.
Hey!
I'm sorry, Pam. It looks a little messy.
Everywhere I look it's Betty White this and Betty White that. Finally a kid that's not talking about Betty White. Of course I follow him.
Ah, Dwell.
How far along?
I don't know, let's try.
Well nobody's touching my cobbler.
Uh, Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying.  You were inferring.
I don't think I'm there yet, Boss.
Let���s try it out.
Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? [Michael, along with the camera, look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door.]
We're screwed.
Thanks.
82 November first. How much is the prize money?
Um, I think there's a misunderstanding, Michael.
[Creed pulls into the parking lot and goes into the office]  Sorry I'm late, boss.  What's going on?
What, is any of this real?
I don't get the big fuss here, I like the site.
[playing chess with Jim]  No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do this, I'm gonna do that.
Have fun!  [sigh]
Guys, E, blues. Follow me, okay? [playing well]
Th-the hair covers it, mostly.
Yeah, she hosts the Dr. Laura Show.
[Michael leaving copy machine] Uh, boss, we're out of paper.
If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am I working toward?
I don't know what to tell you.
Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, 'Have you heard my originals? They're terrible.' They said, 'Even better.' I said, 'I get it. It's an ironic party for Nellie.'
I couldn't care less about nepotism. But, I'm loving the debate. Great minds battling it out. And I've got a front row seat.
I'm just looking.
Oh God. Stuck with the weirdo.
I can bring these to my shelter.
Ah, Hillary Swank.
Cool beans.
Today is actually my birthday and I want to pick the cake.
Just pretend like we're talking until the cops leave.
Sup? [rolls into kitchen on a skateboard]
Beleniege!
Nobody steals from Creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to do this disappeared. His name? [whispering] Creed Bratton.
[sighs] Thank God.
So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by Andy and go like this. [draws finger across neck] Darnell's a chump. I would have done it for anything. I've done a lot more for a lot less.
No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now.
Oh, thanks ese.  So, what are you guys doing?
I pay for that privilege. [goes into stall]
[from desk chair] Oh, come on!
Yes, sir.
He has no wallet, I checked.
Me neither.
No. No. No. You���re way off on that one.
[walks up behind Jim and puts his hands on his shoulders] One more week.
[shaking Holly's hand] The pleasure's all mine.
How'd I get this long triangle?
I'm not good with names.
That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up?
Uh, small things. Peas, ball bearings, dimes...
Hey, why haven't we ever, um...
Tapas swiss miss.
Cambodia.  You?
Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over.  It's a fresh start, it's a clean slate.
My wife���s name is Kathryn. I can show you my social security card if it helps.
Hi kids.
Well I don't even want these. [Takes the rectangle pancakes out of his coat.]
What did I say?
Yeah. Yeah. And I buy them stuff, you know. Oh, made some bad investments. Why are you asking me this?
I really appreciate it, Boss.
Hey cuz, heard you're having money problems.
[notices something new about Dwight] New glasses.
Hey hey hey, quiet, here she comes! Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam.
[receiving message on his phone] Hey! Puck and Finn worked it out, and the solo is now a duet.
[looks at vending machine] Hey brah, I've been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater.
She's crazy hot.
It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring. I took a desk at the back because it was empty. But���[chuckles] no matter how you get there or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home. [standing with two cops] Let���s do this.
Fifteen years, I think.
I saw the leaves twitch!
I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole.
Hello. [Jim replaces Creed's apple with a potato][Creed takes a bite of the potato]
[Angela hands Creed a pack of deodorant] For me?
That is correct.
All right.
Touch me and I'll sue.
You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated.
[holding a fish with all the meat stripped off] Nobody told me we were going to have hot dogs!
www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts. Check it out.
Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if you won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink.
No, no. I had some, thanks.
[to Jordan] Find out what language this is. [speaking in strange language]
[to Rose] You were in the parking lot earlier. That's how I know you.
I already won the lottery. I was born in the US of A, baby. And as backup I have a Swiss passport.
In a minute.
This gal, she's really into you?
Curve the bullet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted.
Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach.
Nothing! Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. C'mon gang.
This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast.
I'll wait. [sighs]
I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff's station.
What?
Well, draw me a map, mama.
Hell of an ass.
Ditto that, my brother.
She's one sassy black lady.
He don't give an 'F' about nothin'!
What are you doing in here? This is the women's room.
Undo it!
[Creed, Stanley, and Oscar sitting at a table] Can we get another round?
Well, I don't want to get raped [picks up clipboard] Twenty-Two!
How far can you reach those Lovely long arms of yours? [Jim reaching his arms out as far as he can go] Eh, put 'em down. How long can you hold that pretty little breath of yours? [Jim inhales] Good.
Best Edward James Olmos costume I've ever seen. Like, freaky good.
Guys, I'm starting to think Pam's not really even pregnant.
Oh, it's okay. I've got tons of them. You like that? Goo-goo-goo-goo?
I can get you one in an hour.
You shouldn't have hit me, Michael.
On the go that's after three.
Yep.
I don't know. I got nephews.
Hey Erin, look who's back. The bird man.
What if you've been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong?
[takes the pictures] Okay I already see one, gimme. Okay.
[approaching Jim and Pam] Hey, did one of you tell Stanley I have asthma? Because I don't, and if it gets out, they won't let me scuba.
[on phone] First of all, I want to thank you for your years of patronizing our company. I've got some bad news. We're going out of business. [covers phone, whispers to Pam] Saving face. [uncovers phone] Yep, yep. I understand that. Basically everything is falling apart here. Pam looks around the office and realizes only she has overheard this]
No time. Dwight, I love Debbie Brown. She's a close personal friend. But quality is my life. This company has a reputation to uphold. As much as it pains me, someone has to be held accountable.
I gave Toby my buddy Jorge's number in Costa.  He'll hook Toby up with everything: cable TV, women, oh, and this amazing coffee to snort.
All right, thank you, bye-bye.
It's Creed. FYI, I'm starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in?
[smacks Meredith���s head] [screams] [runs out]
Psst... [Creed walks by Andy and draws his right index finger across his neck, further scaring Andy, Andy looks over at Darryl who is staring him down]
[talking through bullhorn] Michael, you can not fly, you can not, I've seen this too many times.
[pointing at a whiteboard with BOBODDY written on the left side, vertically] BO-BODDY! BO-BODDY. What does the first 'B' stand for?
I'm out.
[after Michael punches him in the arm] What did you hit me for?
Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy.  When Creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider.
Oh, no. I need the money.
Fright. Being scared to death.
[bleep] you! [bleep] you! God!
The balls on you, man.
I don't care who you talk to. Just make it happen.
Ed was decapitated.
I like it! Business! Good, Kevin! [writes after the first B, I, Z, N, U...] All right! The 'O'...
Yeah, that's all-inclusive.
Right place at the right time.
I don't know. It was so long ago.
Mm-hmm.
We're making acronyms. Okay! What does the first 'B' stand for?
It's not cool.
[hums]
HI mahhhh. Boo yowww. Gunjo! Ooh uncow!
You think?
Kids, kids, kids, slow down.
The perfect cartwheel.
I understand it, I can't speak it.
Remember, you���re a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this.
Yes.
That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica.
Cool beans, man, I live by the quarry.  We should hang out by the quarry and throw things down there.
We're not playing strip pong? [Jim shakes his head no]  Okay. [Creed picks up paddle]
Ah, it's all starting to make sense now.
Back in the '60s, I was with the Grass Roots. We toured with Janis Joplin, The Doors, Cream. We had a lot of fun, And now I do quality assurance for a paper company. As you can imagine, drugs played a part. They still do. My work calls last about 90 seconds, and that's about as long as I can concentrate.
Hey, Angela's back with her baby.
Listen, you will not regret this either. Devon is terrible; No one's gonna miss him. Good, good, good.
Let me have a turn.
Whoa. We got a real Clarence Thomas here.
I heard that from... Andy.
Oh... Where did you get this stuff?
You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners.
Any time.
[on phone] Yo, is this his new chair?
[motions to phyllis's desk]
Challenge.
What do you mean, 'Why?'
For a cat? I could get you a kid for that.
[Bluetooth rings] You got Creed.
Pam, this is important. Was he me? Am I him?
Wesley Silver���s gay?
The Taliban is the worst. Great heroine, though.
Which aisle?
Can't be good.
So hey, I'm want to set you up with my daughter.
What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. 'What do I do?'... Really, what do I do here? I should've written it down. 'Qua' something, uh... qua... quar... quibo, qual...quir-quabity. Quabity assuance! No. No, no, no, no, but I'm getting close.
No, I wanna stay here.
It's a real shame about Ed, huh?
Have you ever seen a foot with four toes? [begins untying shoe]
[on cell phone] Unfortunately, in this ham-fisted production of Sweeney Todd, the real terror comes from the vocal performances. New paragraph.
Ugh.
Yeah.  That's what she said.
You don't go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts.  Nobody just picks up 'get out of jail free' cards, those things cost thousands.
Oh really, what kind? Codeine, Vicodin, Percocet, Fentanyl, Oxycontin, Palladone? What...
I'm having a little trouble motivating.
Two eyes, two ears, a chin, a mouth, ten fingers, two nipples. A butt, two kneecaps, a penis. I have just described to you the Loch Ness Monster. And the reward for its capture? All the riches in Scotland. So I have one question: Why are you here?
Oh nothing.
No, I don't. I wanna stay right here.
We're working. [Jim still holding his breath]
She's messed up man...
Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that.
Let���s find out what I did.
I remember it was very late at night, like 11, 11:30.  Big fella comes in screamin' about God knows what.  I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car.  [Angela rolls her eyes] Something like that.  So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels.  Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter---
She's looking good.
Spanish tapas, and swiss miss hot cocoa--What's so hard to understand?
When I was a teenager, I was in an iron lung.
The feeling of pure risk.
That's great. When you know you know. Hey, what's Ruth's deal, man?
Something's up.  That paper was never supposed to arrive.
You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.
The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job.  I will do whatever it takes to survive.  Like I did... when I was a homeless man.
That's my boss! Yeah-ha baby!
[knocking from outside window in break room] Jim.
Well, I can't, I don't know how.
Do I love being manager?... I love my kids. I love real estate. [slowly getting more excited] I love ceramics. I love my job. I-I love wrestling.
Just boardin', you know how we do. [flips skateboard up]
Yeah. [Jim enters room]
Goodnight Mary-Beth.
Yeah, and I finished my work months ago!
Have you tried making everything smaller?
In the parking lot today there was a circus. The copier did tricks on the high-wire, a lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. There was a Dwight impersonator and a Jim impersonator; a strong man crushed a turtle. I laughed and I cried. Not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company.
The real question here is who's this guy work for?
When Pam gets Michael's old chair, I get Pam's old chair. Then I'll have two chairs. Only one to go.
No.
[spying on David and Jim] They've been in there a while.
One year, I had a close acquaintance of mine back a truck in here and clean out this whole place. That was a very good year. I think they blamed it on some kid.
Who has AIDS?
Oh, I thought it was a volunteer thing.
There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them.
Oh, I thought that was more on a volunteer basis.
About what?
Oh, he does. He does.
[to Dwight] Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown.  I thought maybe you'd like to sign it.  Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her.  She's got some children.
...Excuse me.
Did he actually give you some ganja?
Let's do this thing. [Creed loses the first point, tosses his paddle on the table and starts taking off his shirt.  Jim retrieves the ball and looks back to see Creed with his shirt untucked and unbuttoned]
You're welcome.
Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. He's terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon.
The one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap...
I love it. I actually used to have a radio show back in the '70s.
Hi guys.  Somebody makin' soup?
Everybody get comfy now. This first song's over a half hour long. [plays off-tune notes]
Your shower radio.
About 10 years ago, for tax reasons, I faked my own death. I've been collecting benefits as my own widow ever since.
Come on, boss.
I thought you might.
In a way you did.
Do you have something specific you wanted to talk to me about?
Yes, hello.  Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there.  And I'm trying to remember who it was.  Mm-hmm.  Who wasn't there last week?  Debbie Brown.  And which day was that?  Wednesday, the eleventh.  Perfect.
[zipping up his pants] Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there.
[walking out of the bathroom discovered by all] Uh..ohh!
Hey Jordana! Patch my ninth- and fourth-biggest clients together. [Pam puts down phone and picks it back up]
That wasn't a tapeworm.
What?
[running a meeting in the conference room] Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy, [camera switches to show only Meredith and Kevin have attended the meeting, Jim walks by and sees this] and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed...
Want to play a game?
Okay, you take it easy, ace.
Yeah, that makes way more sense.   Okay thanks boss.
He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean.
[to Jordan] Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant. [closes his office door]
Ok, thirty seconds to showtime!
I hear it, too, Boss.
Oh, you're payin' way too much for your worms, man. Who's your worm guy?
I hate devils food.
Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago, so he doesn't care.
You are welcome.
I'm very relieved to learn it wasn't you.
A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobody's business. I'd like to put the piano in front of Pam without her glasses and see what happens. I'd also like to see her topless.
Pirate code, he wants to meet.
[drives up to the entrance of the building, his license plate reads 'NEW MGR'] It's a beautiful morning at Dunder-Mifflin, or as I like to call it, Great Bratton. [gets out of car, tosses his keys toward a nonexistent valet parker] Keep it running.
Ryan!
What are you telling me?
[as Jim decorates a passed out Todd Packer] Oh, no.
It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh?
Here's the $40 you gave me.
I'd send you to Hong Kong.
[from outside the conference room] Hey, it's the kid! Look, look, look, look, look! [Michael, Toby, Holly, and Pam exit the conference room] Hey! It's the temp! Look! [everyone is crowded around Jim's computer]
Thanks. I never owned a refrigerator.
Hey! What are you guys doing here?
Okay.
Be cool, Michael. I saw this guy kill a bunch of people. Good work.
I have some hemp ropes at my house, they're really strong...
Hey!
Just doing my job, guys.
Let's fight it.
I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.
Did you start the paperwork yet?
That's kinda uncool, man.
What's a text?
[singing] Spinnin' n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet don't touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, I'm crazy about 'ya...
Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here.
