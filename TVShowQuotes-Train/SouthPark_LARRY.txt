But, unfortunately, the government has banned stem cell research and so... we'll never know.

You're Leslie.

Oh wow!

They're coming for me!

Huh?  Whah?!

Well, this is it. I'm going back to my time. Thanks again, boys.

I'm not living here! Living is having ups and downs and sharing them with friends!  Thank you, Stan and Kyle! See ya! 

I'm afraid the government has just put a ban on stem-cell research.

Leslie. It's me, Larry.  Your husband?

Arrrggh! 

Hey kid.  Give 'em hell. Give 'em hell. 

Didn't anybody send out a search party?

Too many people were upset about using aborted fetal tissue for a study. It's too bad, too. We really coulda helped a lot of people.

Look, you have trillions of cells in your body: heart cells, skin cells, brain cells, and so on. But before a cell is designated as a toenail cell or a pancreas cell, it's what we call a stem cell. Sort of like a blank cell. Do you understand?

Today, I went to 7-11 and I ate a Slim Jim. It was the greatest thing I ever tasted. Nobody ever stood up for me before. 

Think hard, Leslie. We used to be together, for over eight years?

Larry!

Good-bye again! I'm off to Des Moines!

No... No, leave them alone. It's a nice change to see people happy here at the DMV.  Perhaps we here at the DMV can start changing as well. Perhaps instead of treating people badly we can offer them comfort and hope. Why, the DMV can be a place where people come to get things off their chests. Confess, yes, but also be told that they're worth something in this world! And then, DMVs everywhere can become a place where people feel safe. And when they do something wrong we can offer forgiveness! Don't you see what this could lead to? Don't you see what we could become??

Uh. Hey, kids, could you just open the door so I can get back to my family?

This is where the bulk of our research was being done. But due to the government ban, we're mostly just packing things up.

Oh no, you built another settlement?

Thanks. 

What the hell is going on here?! This is the DMV! There will be no joy here!

I'm sorry, too. I'll leave you alone.  Eight and thirteen? 

Nooo!

You make me come out of my shell, Shelly.
You give me strength where there was only fear
I ate at a Burger King today, Shelly
And stood up to a boy who called me "queer"
When you pushed me off the diving board I
...fell.
And you make the world a nicer place, Shelly
So I can come out of my... shell.

That was me!

Goodbye, boys. Goodbye, friends! 

I've got you pinned. I win.

Please, Leslie, I don't know where else to go. I'm confused.

I have to go to Platform B.

You boys have really shown me the true meaning of friendship. You didn't care about anything but my happiness. You put me in front of yourselves, and that's what real friendship is all about.

He-e-ey George! What's gon' on?

Shut up! Sit there and wait, and no cell phones or other things that pass time joyously! I'll put a stop to this! 

Because these cells are blanks, they will often program themselves based on what cells you put around them. You see this rat? Earlier this year, we surgically removed the middle of her spine. then we injected her with some stem cells and... they became the missing part of the spine.

Oh, poo!

That's the theory.

What is that? 

Oohh!

Nerve cells damaged by Parkinson's disease or heart tissue of cardiac patients might ultimately be replaced by tissue grown from stem cells.

Where are you going?

Oh well, I'm sorry, but we can't buy those from you now.

Oh, hey kid.  Good luck. Good luck. 

Well, no. To build another Shake's it would be better to use lumber.

Okay, boys. Thanks. 

I got my ticket.
