Wow, you're the coolest kid in the world. If I could call Chris Hansen an asshole-licking dickfart to his face, I would be sooo happy.

That would be great. Thank you.

Yup, nice and boring. Just the way I like it.

After Red Racer.

Okay.  So anyways, are they saying what time the event starts?

This is the end of Smiley Town. The only phone is somewhere in Treasure Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna have to cross the white line.

Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band that any of you said "Hey, you know? This plan might backfire."  No, that never occurred to you. Because you guys are jerks, and you never learn from your mistakes, and that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes.

Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not.

Hey, butch boy. Nice football you got there. 

Well now he just sounds like a self-righteous asshole.

Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe?

That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys, and now I'm in the land of the giants lost world.

Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you?  Because you're always doing stuff like this. You're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something, and then it backfires, and then you end up in some foreign country, or in outer space or something. That's why no one likes hanging out with you guys.

Well, I've gotta go over there and-

Oh my God!

I uh...

Ha, that guy's a pussy. 

All the other teams are worse than us.

You guys never hang out with me. You never invite me to do stuff. But now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me a hundred dollars.

...Fine.

With the lice exam. Did they find anybody with lice? 

Oh yeah?! We're super duper triple-dog gay!

Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are.

I thought we were getting Playstation 4's.

Oh, that's a good idea.

Maybe we should take it so someplace safer.

That's the point, buttpipe.

Kindergartners. Treasure Cove is full of them.

Not all that bad? How could you say that?! You hate this game more than any of us!

Nope. 

Oh. 

Yeah, I can't wait for Sunday.

Nothing broke on the Web site yet.

If I could say "asspussy" to the counselor I would be sooo happy.

I like you Jimmy, but you're not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half.

Hey, there he is! There's the home-schooled kid!  Come on! Let's go duct-tape him to the flagpole! 

Only the six of us are to go?

You call this a party?! Your party sucks!

Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper?

Jewpa what?

Look out! 

Then just give him half.

He's not gonna show up to suck your balls dude.

Game on!

I am not Craig,  I am Ginza,  with the powerful blade of the kitana. Iya!

Every time bad things happen, you guys end up putting yourselves deeper into the middle of it, because "that's just the way it is."

You guys made the front page.

Wow, Kenny's a Japanese princess.

At first we needed our parents' permission, but then we told him our parents were dead.

All right, let's do this!

We got the list from the girls! 

No, it's true. We've always hated you.

Black Friday? Come on, that can't be real.

Have you guys noticed that Bebe isn't as cool as she used to be? 

Maybe. But you'll never be as metrosexual as us! Come on, fags! 

What? That's stupid.

Hell no! I'm not crossing the white line.

"In an email sent yesterday to KENNY McCormick, Stan Marsh wrote 'Dude, you should have been in PE today. Elise Thompson's butt crack was totally showing.' He went on to call her butt crack quote 'nice' and that the whole experience was quote 'pretty awesome'."

I'm being a dick?

Right on the other side of the fairgrounds. He's just wandering around aimlessly.

Okay.

Whoa..

Dude, a going-away party is supposed to be for the person who is going away!

Okay, that's good, because we moved the fight to first thing in the morning tomorrow.

Whatever. I'm going back to play with the Harry Potter kids. 

It's easy. Watch. 

Yeah, but did you see Token's girlfriend? 

I believe in Mr. Jefferson!

...Nope.

Tom Saltzman says you just glued a piece of glass to an iPad cover and you're faking it. 

Nothing! 

I'm not just gay, I'm a catamite. 

Where did you find a red-haired cow?

Then why'd you crap on Garrison's desk?

You don't think they put the fat tub of tard at the bottom?

My name is Craig Tucker. Last week was my birthday.  My Grandma gave me a check for a hundred dollars.  I was sooo happy. But then, four kids from school came to my house  and said I should use my hundred dollars to invest in becoming a Peruvian flute band.  They promised I would double my money in one afternoon.  But the government arrested us along with all the other Peruvian flute bands and took us to an internment camp in Miami.  We begged to go home, but instead the government told us they were sending us to Peru.  And so that is now why I'm in Peru. If I die, let it be known that it is because four guys I don't even like from school lied to me and took my birthday money. 

...But I hate you.

I wouldn't if I were you.

I'm not following you guys any more.

Slash isn't real. He's a made-up person that represents care and giving, and people dress up like him and lie to their kids.

I thought I was the only one.

They did it!

Get him! 

We're still gonna fight on Black Friday, just not with you!

Clyde, dude, get down to the park. We caught Kenny, and we're all gonna let him have it! 

Oh, aaaah, well you guys are dumb.

It's occupied. 

HA! Told you you guys were straight!

Word is that the sixth graders all prefer XBox too, and will team up with Cartman as well.

What do you guys want?

Animals Close-Up With A Wide Angle Lens. 

How do we know it was a boy? It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls!

Oh man, I can't watch this.

Why would he say that?

Respect my authority.

'Cause they're ugly and they stink. 

Just give him half.

What's going on?

Hey, that whale talked to me too. After everyone left the show I walked up to the glass and he started talking.

You know when stuff happens to most kids? They fall off their bikes. They get in fights with their parents. They get swindled out of their birthday money.

I don't care. I've decided that I'm done. I am choosing not to be a part of this anymore.

Don't you have a VHS of it?

He's perfect.

That son of a bitch, I'll kill him!

All the pizza we can eat?

Tom Saltzman says you don't really have an iPad.

You told us your company was gonna make $10 million, and the rest of us could go fuck ourselves.

Cartman's right. If you care about fairness, Stan, then you really have to lose the bracelet.

Okay, okay!

Is so!

The guinea pirate lived, but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days.  And people all over the world learned to support their local Peruvian flute bands, and buy their CDs. For they protect us from the guinea creatures. As for me, I was returned home by Homeland Security.  My parents were sooo happy.  I realized that we don't always have control over what happens to us.  We are but players on the stage of life. And I also learned to never listen when people come asking you for money. 

He had cooties and he lied about it!

Yeah, didn't you see that commercial where it says that if you have pot you could become a terrorist?

Yep. And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon.

Uh-uh, they're not that cool.

Haha, Butters got asked out by a fat girl.

I know.

There's no telling. It could be about any of us. 

You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru, and I'm being a dick?

Yeah, a fifth-grade girlfriend.

Oh, we have a new cheerleader?

But you told us all to go fuck ourselves.

Dude, I was here first.

Yeah, well, I've got an overall deal with the school, heh. They're paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows.

Well I thought I was crazy. He said my dad was gonna sneak into my room naked one night and beat me up.

...Come on, we wanna see the ass people.

Could somebody toss the football back? Its over there next to the ugly kids. 

"Let's see what's in there." That's why you guys get into these situations. Because when you come across a spooky, ancient ruin, you say "Let's see what's in there."

...The truth about what?

We're entering the limits of Bailey. Everyone stay close.

Can we have some food, please? 

What are you guys doing here?

Peru.

Ugh.

Wow, that's pretty trippy.

Hey, that could work.

What are you talking about? 

Oh, Jesus! I can't take it! Stop!

What?! What did he say about Stripe?!

So who do they say is the cutest?

No you don't!

They're still undecided.

...I don't know.

Butters is right on the other side.

All right, this better be good.

Okay, now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes.

Oh, that's awesome.

Meatloaf?

It's Butters! We saw 'im!

Yeah, my mom says I have to be in bed at 9:30.

Dude, what the hell are you talking about?

What do we do?

Red Racer's on.

I... don't believe it.

I knew you guys were going to bail on the party.

Are you guys making this up?

Dude.

That's right. 

So,  how would you ninjas like to do battle?

...So it's true.

He did?

Take your non-flaming ass to some other school! 

Let's go take it!

Uh huh, you guys couldn't get Lorde to play, could you?

Hey yeah.

Wait, wait. What are you talking about, XBox Ones? 

Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches. Yeah, that's about right.

I don't know. Why?

It said in the e-mail if we came we each got five dollars.

Occupied.

Can we please just go home, sir?

Where?

It's true. I walked in on my parents watching Marital Murder Mayhem. They broke the parental lock somehow.

Yeah. That's true.

What?

Hah hah hahah hah! 

Just get out of the hamster ball, or else you're gonna find out!

Where was all this?

We know, Mr. Mackey. We all have our Belarus bracelets too. 

What?

Why?

...I don't think that's a very good idea, sir.

You shut up, asshole.

I have no idea.

You're too young.

How was that cheating!

Your local DMV is funded by your tax dollars to be efficient and proficient.

Oh hey guys. Heard about your news show being cancelled.

No.

Butters!

All right, let's DO IT!

It's not somebody in this room.

No.

It's awesome.

Hey gang, I brought the new episode of wide angle, close-up animals. 

Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball.

Yeah. Boooo!

That's true, huh? Man, that makes me really reflect on my pet.

Well, yeah, but Wendy, you have to admit, Bebe's a lot smarter and more organized than you.

Yeah, why don't you go home and cry to your stuffed animals again?! 

Stuck in his eye? Was he bleeding?

You can't pass through this area until you defend your honor! 

For what?

He ate it!

Can't believe it.

This girl touched my thigh.

Well, I gotta admit, you guys throw a pretty sweet party.

Enjoying your lunch, nerdo?

This much more than you had!  Hey, a round of root beers for everyone! On me! 

...Okay. 

Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!

No.

I got new orders. I'm supposed to take you to see the mayor.

Aaaaaaaaaaaahh, no.

No I didn't.

I'm gonna kick your ass!

Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend!

But who?

Whenever I'm confused about what's going on in a movie, I'm always so relieved when Morgan Freeman shows up and explains the plot to me.

It could hold a mental spell of some kind.

Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole.

No.

You were right all along, Eric. It was Kenny.

Hey, did you see today's newspaper?

Don't worry, Stan, I don't think the fight's even gonna happen. Cartman said that Wendy's already begging him to call it off.

I spent three hours last night trying to get Tweek's parents to stop griefing my castle! When I finally got away from them, I found they had taken all my dandelions!

Exclusive: Stan Marsh thinks Elise Thompson has a hot butt crack.

Yeah!

...Aahhhh, no, I don't think so.

No.

Everyone who wants to get PS4s, join with us! 

This ass is unlike any I've encountered, Master. 

We're just a dying breed, Stan. XBox is going to win this whole thing.

Butters! Where the hell are you?!

Whoa, what's this thing? Where am I?

I have no idea.

You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots?

I've been waiting for this all week.

Butters!

If I could yell "tampon dickshit" in the classroom I'd be sooo happy.

You know the rule. No ginger kids in the cafeteria.

So then just get a bigger bully to beat the bully up.

I'll go get the money. 

These Pioneer Village workers are really committed to their jobs. 

This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better.

What was on the news?

Huh?

You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove?

I'm sorry for fighting, you guys. 

Because whoever it is just now posted a new story on Eavesdropper: "Allison Taft reveals embarrassing secret about Craig Tucker."  Yeah. Hey wait, that's me.

Hey Token. If you're gonna get Kyle to video that stuff for you, you should probably tell him the truth.

No way.

No way.

No! He's my friend!

You can't call dibs on a toilet.

If I could say "titty sprinkles" on national television I would be sooo happy.

Please sir, it's very important.

So how do we take over Black Robin?

Everyone knows it's true!

Yeah, little bitch!

Get out of here.

Where's our five dollars?

Yeah!

Ohhhh.

I've never been in a fight before.

What?

I wanna use it.

Craig.

That was it? That was you guys' whole plan? Ask the Russians to take the whale to space?

Ah! Look at that! I'm hotter than you, fatso! 

Lose who?

"Hey, Craig. You know that money your grandma gave you for your birthday? How would you like to invest in a Peruvian flute band? You can double your money in one afternoon. Come on, Craig, don't be an asshole." 

Haha.

Some kid.

Yeah, life sucks sometimes, but it'll pass.

Take that, kindergartners!

You guys!  You guys!

He got it! He got the device! 

Yeah. We're paying for your being fat.

I do watch Red Racer every day of the week!

Sir, I promise you, I'm not going to ruin your plans. I'll just walk away. See? 

Urh urh urh! 

What?

That's exactly how XBox people are!

Incriminate.

To hell with that!

You just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world.

You guys look pretty gay.

Do you mind, sir? We wanna watch Stan and Kyle play. 

Where'd you get those?

Hey, here's a post about Token: "Token Black's Private Gym Photos" 

Hey. Hey, I got one.  Why do girls wear makeup and perfume?

He killed my character right in the middle of a quest!

Um...  Okay. I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incinerate me.
