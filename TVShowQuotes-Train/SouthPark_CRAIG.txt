Take your non-flaming ass to some other school! 
You told us your company was gonna make $10 million, and the rest of us could go fuck ourselves.
Sir, I promise you, I'm not going to ruin your plans. I'll just walk away. See? 
How can I resist an ass so great?
Slash isn't real. He's a made-up person that represents care and giving, and people dress up like him and lie to their kids.
Every time bad things happen, you guys end up putting yourselves deeper into the middle of it, because "that's just the way it is."
So who do they say is the cutest?
It could hold a mental spell of some kind.
"Hey, Craig. You know that money your grandma gave you for your birthday? How would you like to invest in a Peruvian flute band? You can double your money in one afternoon. Come on, Craig, don't be an asshole." 
The guinea pirate lived, but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days.  And people all over the world learned to support their local Peruvian flute bands, and buy their CDs. For they protect us from the guinea creatures. As for me, I was returned home by Homeland Security.  My parents were sooo happy.  I realized that we don't always have control over what happens to us.  We are but players on the stage of life. And I also learned to never listen when people come asking you for money. 
With the lice exam. Did they find anybody with lice? 
Aha!  There you are! You guys thought you were so cool, didn't you?! Well look at what we got! 
Because whoever it is just now posted a new story on Eavesdropper: "Allison Taft reveals embarrassing secret about Craig Tucker."  Yeah. Hey wait, that's me.
I spent three hours last night trying to get Tweek's parents to stop griefing my castle! When I finally got away from them, I found they had taken all my dandelions!
Have you guys noticed that Bebe isn't as cool as she used to be? 
I am not Craig,  I am Ginza,  with the powerful blade of the kitana. Iya!
How do we know it was a boy? It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls!
Hey, there he is! There's the home-schooled kid!  Come on! Let's go duct-tape him to the flagpole! 
If I could say "asspussy" to the counselor I would be sooo happy.
I do watch Red Racer every day of the week!
Okay, now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes.
This is the end of Smiley Town. The only phone is somewhere in Treasure Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna have to cross the white line.
Yeah, well, I've got an overall deal with the school, heh. They're paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows.
Hey, I hate Cartman too. Can I ignore him with you?
Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not.
Maybe we should take it so someplace safer.
Well, I gotta admit, you guys throw a pretty sweet party.
You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove?
Do you mind, sir? We wanna watch Stan and Kyle play. 
"Let's see what's in there." That's why you guys get into these situations. Because when you come across a spooky, ancient ruin, you say "Let's see what's in there."
So then just get a bigger bully to beat the bully up.
Right on the other side of the fairgrounds. He's just wandering around aimlessly.
You know the rule. No ginger kids in the cafeteria.
Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!
Hey, here's a post about Token: "Token Black's Private Gym Photos" 
You can't pass through this area until you defend your honor! 
Hey Token. If you're gonna get Kyle to video that stuff for you, you should probably tell him the truth.
If I could yell "tampon dickshit" in the classroom I'd be sooo happy.
Haha, Butters got asked out by a fat girl.
You just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world.
You were right all along, Eric. It was Kenny.
...Come on, we wanna see the ass people.
There's no telling. It could be about any of us. 
Hell no! I'm not crossing the white line.
Hey, butch boy. Nice football you got there. 
You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots?
Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole.
Dude, a going-away party is supposed to be for the person who is going away!
He's not gonna show up to suck your balls dude.
Everyone who wants to get PS4s, join with us! 
He had cooties and he lied about it!
Yeah, my mom says I have to be in bed at 9:30.
Yeah, didn't you see that commercial where it says that if you have pot you could become a terrorist?
This ass is unlike any I've encountered, Master. 
That son of a bitch, I'll kill him!
Wow, you're the coolest kid in the world. If I could call Chris Hansen an asshole-licking dickfart to his face, I would be sooo happy.
But you told us all to go fuck ourselves.
Hey gang, I brought the new episode of wide angle, close-up animals. 
Maybe. But you'll never be as metrosexual as us! Come on, fags! 
Whatever. I'm going back to play with the Harry Potter kids. 
Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you?  Because you're always doing stuff like this. You're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something, and then it backfires, and then you end up in some foreign country, or in outer space or something. That's why no one likes hanging out with you guys.
Black Friday? Come on, that can't be real.
This much more than you had!  Hey, a round of root beers for everyone! On me! 
These Pioneer Village workers are really committed to their jobs. 
Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe?
I got new orders. I'm supposed to take you to see the mayor.
Well I thought I was crazy. He said my dad was gonna sneak into my room naked one night and beat me up.
Okay, that's good, because we moved the fight to first thing in the morning tomorrow.
Cartman's right. If you care about fairness, Stan, then you really have to lose the bracelet.
...I don't think that's a very good idea, sir.
Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band that any of you said "Hey, you know? This plan might backfire."  No, that never occurred to you. Because you guys are jerks, and you never learn from your mistakes, and that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes.
That was it? That was you guys' whole plan? Ask the Russians to take the whale to space?
Tom Saltzman says you don't really have an iPad.
Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend!
That's true, huh? Man, that makes me really reflect on my pet.
Well now he just sounds like a self-righteous asshole.
We're entering the limits of Bailey. Everyone stay close.
That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys, and now I'm in the land of the giants lost world.
It's true. I walked in on my parents watching Marital Murder Mayhem. They broke the parental lock somehow.
It said in the e-mail if we came we each got five dollars.
I like you Jimmy, but you're not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half.
Oh hey guys. Heard about your news show being cancelled.
Not all that bad? How could you say that?! You hate this game more than any of us!
Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches. Yeah, that's about right.
My name is Craig Tucker. Last week was my birthday.  My Grandma gave me a check for a hundred dollars.  I was sooo happy. But then, four kids from school came to my house  and said I should use my hundred dollars to invest in becoming a Peruvian flute band.  They promised I would double my money in one afternoon.  But the government arrested us along with all the other Peruvian flute bands and took us to an internment camp in Miami.  We begged to go home, but instead the government told us they were sending us to Peru.  And so that is now why I'm in Peru. If I die, let it be known that it is because four guys I don't even like from school lied to me and took my birthday money. 
We know, Mr. Mackey. We all have our Belarus bracelets too. 
He's the luckiest kid in the world. If I could say "shitballs" to the principal I'd be sooo happy.
Wait, wait. What are you talking about, XBox Ones? 
Yep. And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon.
"In an email sent yesterday to KENNY McCormick, Stan Marsh wrote 'Dude, you should have been in PE today. Elise Thompson's butt crack was totally showing.' He went on to call her butt crack quote 'nice' and that the whole experience was quote 'pretty awesome'."
Um...  Okay. I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incinerate me.
This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better.
Clyde, dude, get down to the park. We caught Kenny, and we're all gonna let him have it! 
If I could say "titty sprinkles" on national television I would be sooo happy.
He killed my character right in the middle of a quest!
Yup, nice and boring. Just the way I like it.
You call this a party?! Your party sucks!
Could somebody toss the football back? Its over there next to the ugly kids. 
At first we needed our parents' permission, but then we told him our parents were dead.
Your local DMV is funded by your tax dollars to be efficient and proficient.
So,  how would you ninjas like to do battle?
Don't worry, Stan, I don't think the fight's even gonna happen. Cartman said that Wendy's already begging him to call it off.
Yeah, why don't you go home and cry to your stuffed animals again?! 
You don't think they put the fat tub of tard at the bottom?
I didn't hear him coming with all your screaming.
You guys never hang out with me. You never invite me to do stuff. But now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me a hundred dollars.
Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball.
Oh shit, you guys are in trouble. We're outta here!
Only the six of us are to go?
Tom Saltzman says you just glued a piece of glass to an iPad cover and you're faking it. 
All the other teams are worse than us.
Hey, that whale talked to me too. After everyone left the show I walked up to the glass and he started talking.
Word is that the sixth graders all prefer XBox too, and will team up with Cartman as well.
Okay.  So anyways, are they saying what time the event starts?
Uh huh, you guys couldn't get Lorde to play, could you?
I knew you guys were going to bail on the party.
I don't care. I've decided that I'm done. I am choosing not to be a part of this anymore.
You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru, and I'm being a dick?
You're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list!
Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow.
So how do we take over Black Robin?
My name is Craig Tucker. Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth. All the Peruvian flute bands were released,  and drove the guinea creatures back to the Andes mountains.  Many people had died, but mankind had prevailed.  All over the world, survivors were found, living witnesses to the horror that had been seen.
Exclusive: Stan Marsh thinks Elise Thompson has a hot butt crack.
