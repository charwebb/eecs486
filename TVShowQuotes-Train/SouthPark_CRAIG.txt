Cartman's right. If you care about fairness, Stan, then you really have to lose the bracelet.
If I could say "asspussy" to the counselor I would be sooo happy.
Whenever I'm confused about what's going on in a movie, I'm always so relieved when Morgan Freeman shows up and explains the plot to me.
He had cooties and he lied about it!
You don't think they put the fat tub of tard at the bottom?
Hey, there he is! There's the home-schooled kid!  Come on! Let's go duct-tape him to the flagpole! 
That son of a bitch, I'll kill him!
I knew you guys were going to bail on the party.
Tom Saltzman says you just glued a piece of glass to an iPad cover and you're faking it. 
You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru, and I'm being a dick?
That's true, huh? Man, that makes me really reflect on my pet.
Yep. And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon.
Yup, nice and boring. Just the way I like it.
You call this a party?! Your party sucks!
He killed my character right in the middle of a quest!
Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow.
So how do we take over Black Robin?
These Pioneer Village workers are really committed to their jobs. 
Hey. Hey, I got one.  Why do girls wear makeup and perfume?
Haha, Butters got asked out by a fat girl.
"In an email sent yesterday to KENNY McCormick, Stan Marsh wrote 'Dude, you should have been in PE today. Elise Thompson's butt crack was totally showing.' He went on to call her butt crack quote 'nice' and that the whole experience was quote 'pretty awesome'."
You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove?
He's not gonna show up to suck your balls dude.
Maybe. But you'll never be as metrosexual as us! Come on, fags! 
At first we needed our parents' permission, but then we told him our parents were dead.
Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!
This ass is unlike any I've encountered, Master. 
Yeah, come on! We're gonna find out sooner or later.
I spent three hours last night trying to get Tweek's parents to stop griefing my castle! When I finally got away from them, I found they had taken all my dandelions!
Aha!  There you are! You guys thought you were so cool, didn't you?! Well look at what we got! 
You were right all along, Eric. It was Kenny.
Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are.
Dude, what the hell are you talking about?
Clyde, dude, get down to the park. We caught Kenny, and we're all gonna let him have it! 
Uh huh, you guys couldn't get Lorde to play, could you?
He's the luckiest kid in the world. If I could say "shitballs" to the principal I'd be sooo happy.
That was it? That was you guys' whole plan? Ask the Russians to take the whale to space?
So,  how would you ninjas like to do battle?
Because whoever it is just now posted a new story on Eavesdropper: "Allison Taft reveals embarrassing secret about Craig Tucker."  Yeah. Hey wait, that's me.
Hey gang, I brought the new episode of wide angle, close-up animals. 
I got new orders. I'm supposed to take you to see the mayor.
Sir, I promise you, I'm not going to ruin your plans. I'll just walk away. See? 
You guys never hang out with me. You never invite me to do stuff. But now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me a hundred dollars.
The guinea pirate lived, but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days.  And people all over the world learned to support their local Peruvian flute bands, and buy their CDs. For they protect us from the guinea creatures. As for me, I was returned home by Homeland Security.  My parents were sooo happy.  I realized that we don't always have control over what happens to us.  We are but players on the stage of life. And I also learned to never listen when people come asking you for money. 
How do we know it was a boy? It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls!
Hey, butch boy. Nice football you got there. 
Yeah, didn't you see that commercial where it says that if you have pot you could become a terrorist?
So then just get a bigger bully to beat the bully up.
This is the end of Smiley Town. The only phone is somewhere in Treasure Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna have to cross the white line.
...I don't think that's a very good idea, sir.
Exclusive: Stan Marsh thinks Elise Thompson has a hot butt crack.
With the lice exam. Did they find anybody with lice? 
Slash isn't real. He's a made-up person that represents care and giving, and people dress up like him and lie to their kids.
I didn't hear him coming with all your screaming.
Have you guys noticed that Bebe isn't as cool as she used to be? 
Um...  Okay. I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incinerate me.
Don't worry, Stan, I don't think the fight's even gonna happen. Cartman said that Wendy's already begging him to call it off.
Could somebody toss the football back? Its over there next to the ugly kids. 
Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you?  Because you're always doing stuff like this. You're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something, and then it backfires, and then you end up in some foreign country, or in outer space or something. That's why no one likes hanging out with you guys.
Well, I gotta admit, you guys throw a pretty sweet party.
Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not.
Hey, that whale talked to me too. After everyone left the show I walked up to the glass and he started talking.
Okay.  So anyways, are they saying what time the event starts?
Yeah, my mom says I have to be in bed at 9:30.
Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band that any of you said "Hey, you know? This plan might backfire."  No, that never occurred to you. Because you guys are jerks, and you never learn from your mistakes, and that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes.
You just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world.
We're entering the limits of Bailey. Everyone stay close.
You can't pass through this area until you defend your honor! 
Only the six of us are to go?
We know, Mr. Mackey. We all have our Belarus bracelets too. 
It's true. I walked in on my parents watching Marital Murder Mayhem. They broke the parental lock somehow.
Every time bad things happen, you guys end up putting yourselves deeper into the middle of it, because "that's just the way it is."
We're just a dying breed, Stan. XBox is going to win this whole thing.
This much more than you had!  Hey, a round of root beers for everyone! On me! 
There's no telling. It could be about any of us. 
It just looked like you cut it off, that's all.
Oh shit, you guys are in trouble. We're outta here!
"Let's see what's in there." That's why you guys get into these situations. Because when you come across a spooky, ancient ruin, you say "Let's see what's in there."
I do watch Red Racer every day of the week!
It said in the e-mail if we came we each got five dollars.
It could hold a mental spell of some kind.
Well I thought I was crazy. He said my dad was gonna sneak into my room naked one night and beat me up.
Well, yeah, but Wendy, you have to admit, Bebe's a lot smarter and more organized than you.
How can I resist an ass so great?
Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches. Yeah, that's about right.
Dude, a going-away party is supposed to be for the person who is going away!
Maybe we should take it so someplace safer.
Oh hey guys. Heard about your news show being cancelled.
This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better.
Hey Token. If you're gonna get Kyle to video that stuff for you, you should probably tell him the truth.
Whatever. I'm going back to play with the Harry Potter kids. 
...Come on, we wanna see the ass people.
Do you mind, sir? We wanna watch Stan and Kyle play. 
If I could say "titty sprinkles" on national television I would be sooo happy.
My name is Craig Tucker. Last week was my birthday.  My Grandma gave me a check for a hundred dollars.  I was sooo happy. But then, four kids from school came to my house  and said I should use my hundred dollars to invest in becoming a Peruvian flute band.  They promised I would double my money in one afternoon.  But the government arrested us along with all the other Peruvian flute bands and took us to an internment camp in Miami.  We begged to go home, but instead the government told us they were sending us to Peru.  And so that is now why I'm in Peru. If I die, let it be known that it is because four guys I don't even like from school lied to me and took my birthday money. 
Take your non-flaming ass to some other school! 
Just get out of the hamster ball, or else you're gonna find out!
I'm clean! I knew I didn't have any stupid lice! 
Black Friday? Come on, that can't be real.
Word is that the sixth graders all prefer XBox too, and will team up with Cartman as well.
Tom Saltzman says you don't really have an iPad.
Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend!
Yeah, why don't you go home and cry to your stuffed animals again?! 
But you told us all to go fuck ourselves.
Not all that bad? How could you say that?! You hate this game more than any of us!
That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys, and now I'm in the land of the giants lost world.
If I could yell "tampon dickshit" in the classroom I'd be sooo happy.
Hey, here's a post about Token: "Token Black's Private Gym Photos" 
You told us your company was gonna make $10 million, and the rest of us could go fuck ourselves.
You know the rule. No ginger kids in the cafeteria.
You're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list!
Well now he just sounds like a self-righteous asshole.
Hell no! I'm not crossing the white line.
Yeah, well, I've got an overall deal with the school, heh. They're paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows.
So who do they say is the cutest?
Wow, you're the coolest kid in the world. If I could call Chris Hansen an asshole-licking dickfart to his face, I would be sooo happy.
Hey, I hate Cartman too. Can I ignore him with you?
Right on the other side of the fairgrounds. He's just wandering around aimlessly.
Your local DMV is funded by your tax dollars to be efficient and proficient.
Everyone who wants to get PS4s, join with us! 
My name is Craig Tucker. Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth. All the Peruvian flute bands were released,  and drove the guinea creatures back to the Andes mountains.  Many people had died, but mankind had prevailed.  All over the world, survivors were found, living witnesses to the horror that had been seen.
You know when stuff happens to most kids? They fall off their bikes. They get in fights with their parents. They get swindled out of their birthday money.
All the other teams are worse than us.
