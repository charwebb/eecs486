That son of a bitch, I'll kill him!

Hey, I hate Cartman too. Can I ignore him with you?

I didn't hear him coming with all your screaming.

So how do we take over Black Robin?

At first we needed our parents' permission, but then we told him our parents were dead.

Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches. Yeah, that's about right.

This much more than you had!  Hey, a round of root beers for everyone! On me! 

Whenever I'm confused about what's going on in a movie, I'm always so relieved when Morgan Freeman shows up and explains the plot to me.

Yep. And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon.

Well, I gotta admit, you guys throw a pretty sweet party.

We're still gonna fight on Black Friday, just not with you!

Could somebody toss the football back? Its over there next to the ugly kids. 

Slash isn't real. He's a made-up person that represents care and giving, and people dress up like him and lie to their kids.

Maybe. But you'll never be as metrosexual as us! Come on, fags! 

I'm clean! I knew I didn't have any stupid lice! 

Hey, butch boy. Nice football you got there. 

So who do they say is the cutest?

You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots?

Okay, now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes.

...Come on, we wanna see the ass people.

Yeah, why don't you go home and cry to your stuffed animals again?! 

Only the six of us are to go?

Right on the other side of the fairgrounds. He's just wandering around aimlessly.

Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!

Well, yeah, but Wendy, you have to admit, Bebe's a lot smarter and more organized than you.

You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove?

So,  how would you ninjas like to do battle?

You were right all along, Eric. It was Kenny.

Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball.

If I could say "asspussy" to the counselor I would be sooo happy.

Hey, here's a post about Token: "Token Black's Private Gym Photos" 

Maybe we should take it so someplace safer.

Exclusive: Stan Marsh thinks Elise Thompson has a hot butt crack.

"Hey, Craig. You know that money your grandma gave you for your birthday? How would you like to invest in a Peruvian flute band? You can double your money in one afternoon. Come on, Craig, don't be an asshole." 

That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys, and now I'm in the land of the giants lost world.

You can't pass through this area until you defend your honor! 

I like you Jimmy, but you're not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half.

Dude, what the hell are you talking about?

Oh shit, you guys are in trouble. We're outta here!

We know, Mr. Mackey. We all have our Belarus bracelets too. 

Ah! Look at that! I'm hotter than you, fatso! 

Don't worry, Stan, I don't think the fight's even gonna happen. Cartman said that Wendy's already begging him to call it off.

If I could say "titty sprinkles" on national television I would be sooo happy.

Tom Saltzman says you don't really have an iPad.

You call this a party?! Your party sucks!

Your local DMV is funded by your tax dollars to be efficient and proficient.

It's true. I walked in on my parents watching Marital Murder Mayhem. They broke the parental lock somehow.

I knew you guys were going to bail on the party.

Yeah, my mom says I have to be in bed at 9:30.

Hey, there he is! There's the home-schooled kid!  Come on! Let's go duct-tape him to the flagpole! 

Yup, nice and boring. Just the way I like it.

Just get out of the hamster ball, or else you're gonna find out!

Aha!  There you are! You guys thought you were so cool, didn't you?! Well look at what we got! 

Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend!

...I don't think that's a very good idea, sir.

Hey, that whale talked to me too. After everyone left the show I walked up to the glass and he started talking.

You know the rule. No ginger kids in the cafeteria.

Take your non-flaming ass to some other school! 

We're entering the limits of Bailey. Everyone stay close.

I do watch Red Racer every day of the week!

This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better.

Yeah, didn't you see that commercial where it says that if you have pot you could become a terrorist?

There's no telling. It could be about any of us. 

Hey. Hey, I got one.  Why do girls wear makeup and perfume?

Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band that any of you said "Hey, you know? This plan might backfire."  No, that never occurred to you. Because you guys are jerks, and you never learn from your mistakes, and that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes.

How do we know it was a boy? It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls!

If I could yell "tampon dickshit" in the classroom I'd be sooo happy.

Hey Token. If you're gonna get Kyle to video that stuff for you, you should probably tell him the truth.

Um...  Okay. I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incinerate me.

But you told us all to go fuck ourselves.

He's the luckiest kid in the world. If I could say "shitballs" to the principal I'd be sooo happy.

Have you guys noticed that Bebe isn't as cool as she used to be? 

Uh huh, you guys couldn't get Lorde to play, could you?

You told us your company was gonna make $10 million, and the rest of us could go fuck ourselves.

Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow.

Okay, that's good, because we moved the fight to first thing in the morning tomorrow.

You know when stuff happens to most kids? They fall off their bikes. They get in fights with their parents. They get swindled out of their birthday money.

The guinea pirate lived, but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days.  And people all over the world learned to support their local Peruvian flute bands, and buy their CDs. For they protect us from the guinea creatures. As for me, I was returned home by Homeland Security.  My parents were sooo happy.  I realized that we don't always have control over what happens to us.  We are but players on the stage of life. And I also learned to never listen when people come asking you for money. 

We're just a dying breed, Stan. XBox is going to win this whole thing.

That's true, huh? Man, that makes me really reflect on my pet.

Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe?

That was it? That was you guys' whole plan? Ask the Russians to take the whale to space?

"Let's see what's in there." That's why you guys get into these situations. Because when you come across a spooky, ancient ruin, you say "Let's see what's in there."

I spent three hours last night trying to get Tweek's parents to stop griefing my castle! When I finally got away from them, I found they had taken all my dandelions!

Well I thought I was crazy. He said my dad was gonna sneak into my room naked one night and beat me up.

Haha, Butters got asked out by a fat girl.

Tom Saltzman says you just glued a piece of glass to an iPad cover and you're faking it. 

"In an email sent yesterday to KENNY McCormick, Stan Marsh wrote 'Dude, you should have been in PE today. Elise Thompson's butt crack was totally showing.' He went on to call her butt crack quote 'nice' and that the whole experience was quote 'pretty awesome'."

My name is Craig Tucker. Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth. All the Peruvian flute bands were released,  and drove the guinea creatures back to the Andes mountains.  Many people had died, but mankind had prevailed.  All over the world, survivors were found, living witnesses to the horror that had been seen.

Every time bad things happen, you guys end up putting yourselves deeper into the middle of it, because "that's just the way it is."

Everyone who wants to get PS4s, join with us! 

It could hold a mental spell of some kind.

Because whoever it is just now posted a new story on Eavesdropper: "Allison Taft reveals embarrassing secret about Craig Tucker."  Yeah. Hey wait, that's me.

This ass is unlike any I've encountered, Master. 

I got new orders. I'm supposed to take you to see the mayor.

Do you mind, sir? We wanna watch Stan and Kyle play. 

You guys never hang out with me. You never invite me to do stuff. But now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me a hundred dollars.

Wait, wait. What are you talking about, XBox Ones? 

He had cooties and he lied about it!

Hell no! I'm not crossing the white line.

So then just get a bigger bully to beat the bully up.

Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole.

I don't care. I've decided that I'm done. I am choosing not to be a part of this anymore.

It said in the e-mail if we came we each got five dollars.

Hey gang, I brought the new episode of wide angle, close-up animals. 

It just looked like you cut it off, that's all.

All the other teams are worse than us.

I am not Craig,  I am Ginza,  with the powerful blade of the kitana. Iya!

He killed my character right in the middle of a quest!

Oh hey guys. Heard about your news show being cancelled.

Yeah, come on! We're gonna find out sooner or later.

You just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world.

You're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list!

You don't think they put the fat tub of tard at the bottom?

These Pioneer Village workers are really committed to their jobs. 

Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you?  Because you're always doing stuff like this. You're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something, and then it backfires, and then you end up in some foreign country, or in outer space or something. That's why no one likes hanging out with you guys.

Clyde, dude, get down to the park. We caught Kenny, and we're all gonna let him have it! 

Dude, a going-away party is supposed to be for the person who is going away!

Well now he just sounds like a self-righteous asshole.

You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru, and I'm being a dick?

This is the end of Smiley Town. The only phone is somewhere in Treasure Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna have to cross the white line.

My name is Craig Tucker. Last week was my birthday.  My Grandma gave me a check for a hundred dollars.  I was sooo happy. But then, four kids from school came to my house  and said I should use my hundred dollars to invest in becoming a Peruvian flute band.  They promised I would double my money in one afternoon.  But the government arrested us along with all the other Peruvian flute bands and took us to an internment camp in Miami.  We begged to go home, but instead the government told us they were sending us to Peru.  And so that is now why I'm in Peru. If I die, let it be known that it is because four guys I don't even like from school lied to me and took my birthday money. 

Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are.
