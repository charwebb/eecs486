Wait a minute. What is this?  This says it was bought at Lowe's Home and Garden for $29.95. 
Oh okay, Mom. Let's go fight the Emos, Mom.
What's the point? Save some people so some other people can be lame? And then those lame-os can be lamer to some other posers?
That's the name my stupid parents gave me! I like to be called by my Goth name: NightPain
No, they're just, like, ficus plants and vibrating pots.
Emos? ...Ew-oh my God, Emos are such wannabe conformists.
Agrees with who? Is that red dye in your hair or did a blood demon take a shit on your head, poser?
Why should I? Just 'cause you summoned me doesn't mean you're the boss of me!
You can't tell me what to do! Who elected you the mayor of me?!
Children of Darkness, I would help you, but I fear I cannot be seen with a bunch of douchey Vamp kids and their poser-ass plastic fangs.
I can't right now. I'm dealing with a lot and I just have a lot of anxiety.
God, you guys are so lame!  And if you want my help, you'd better all stop calling me Edgar.
Why have the living summoned me from my rest?
