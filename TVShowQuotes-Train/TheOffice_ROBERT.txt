[telling story to Nellie.] I stepped in right away and start--
What, as some sort of last hoorah?
She, she is remarkable.
That business can't attract anyone. It's awful up there. Those people seem like they're in prison, waiting out life sentences in a... dying industry.
Ah-ah-ah- your drive, your ambition. It would be wasted on a manager's job. And Florida, you don't want to live here. Even I don't want to live here. That's why I'm always at my place in Scranton. Florida is America's basement: It's wet, it's filled with mold, strange insects, alligators. Alligators are dinosaurs, Dwight. You know that, right?
Interesting. Yes. No, yes, I see that. Great work, team. Great party.
Now we get to the bottom of Nellie���s ���yes, yes, yes, yes, never.���
Probably shouldn���t have said that. [Jim���s jaw drops]
Yeah.
[laughs] About twelve hundred. What the hell, grab a bottle. Less inventory for the lawyers.
Why? Not only are you terrible at squash, but you don't even seem to enjoy it. Jim, this is not enough of a challenge for me.
Oh yes it can.
Everyone, this Bert, my son. Bert, this is... a paper company.
In the box.
--with this new self-awareness, I was finally able to find love at long last. With my amazing��� Chief of Staff Wesley Silver.
Look at this wonderful recognition of Nellie's leadership. I believe. [applause continues]
Vanilla? No no no no.  You���ll never guess in a million billion years you���ll never guess.
No. Absolutely not. Andrew there must be something you can do. Think.
Where���s the Advil, Jim? I think I���ve hit my limit on the Tylenol ��� Oh.
Andrew. [Robert extends his hand.]
Well that's a shame.
Interesting. So what is Dunder Mifflin's oatmeal cookie? What is the product that no one wants?
You read my notebook? And photocopied it. And distributed it.
Ha, I guess I think they���re losers.
What is this?
Ow! Damn it, Kevin! God!
And why is Black Rock suddenly the paragon by which all hedge funds must now be compared?
Alright. Sounds like somebody wants to walk away with this. [holds up large check for $2,000]
Bella here was a therapy dog for ten years. when her owner passed away she came to this organization for placement. But people don't often adopt older dogs, so Bella and eleven heroes like her are being cared for by our generous volunteers because frankly nobody else will
Where is everyone? Where is Andy?
Ah, well, it is astounding what a difference that can make, isn't it?
Well...
Oh yes. How hilarious it is to laugh at clowns, the painted jesters of the dying circus industry. Very funny, Jim. I get it.
Are you scared of snakes?
Have you considered the possibility that you slept with a drifter?
Yeah, so I'm hoping to identify some truly exceptional women who show great promise. Well, Andy, it's been fun.
Jim, I told Andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. By contrast, Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it. To make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with Jo Bennett, my boss.
I���d love some coffee.
Hello.
[to Kevin] You seem unimpressed.  Ghosts don���t scare you?
Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida?
No, come on.
It's done.
Thank you so much.
I'm just about to give the tour.
Well, it's mine. You took it out of my bag.
No games.
Oh, for god ���
Excuse me?
Some people doodle at work when they let their mind run. They draw houses, penises. Funny how the houses are always colonials and the penises are always circumcised. Don���t you think? Well, I doodle too, but I���m not an artist. So I draw words and lists.
Describe your day so far.
Midnight Rambler?
Two secretaries could convey a sense of importance and success to our clients. Certainly worth exploring; wouldn���t you agree Andy?
And what?
I don't know. Maybe not. Just come.
No games.
Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said.
Impressive initiative. I don't know what's worse, the trip or the destination. [Gabe laughs] Well, uh, let me settle in and I'll be with you shortly.
Well, I was hoping to talk out some ideas with Andy. But what we have here... is perhaps better. By not going on the trip, you've shown you're the free-thinkers of the office.
I am so eager to hear your game-changers. Let's dig in, shall we?
Tambourine? You know I���m the CEO, right?
Good. It seems like you have this under control. So I���ll just duck out and run the company for a while.
Okay, enough of this. I mean, really, enough. It's gotten way out of hand. Andrew, this is my wife. Whatever privacy you were trying to protect between us, I thank you for. But it is not welcome right now. Just be honest.
And when you recount your day, never say you woke up. It���s a waste of your time. That���s how every day���s begun, for everyone, since the dawn of man.
Andy, we're going to go with Nellie as manager and put you back on the sales team. I promise you, in time, we'll all laugh about this incident. I already think it's kind of funny. [chuckles]
Let me guess, you want one too? Take the family to Disneytown?
Darryl, Andy, Kevin, this is Curtis Dorough, local musician and the officiate at my wedding.
You were going to talk at the end of the��� I���m not here.
Shh��� shh��� [vomits in trash can]
Hey! [Kevin embraces Robert in a tight hug] Oh!
Why would I���..?
We have a manager.
I am. [laughs] I'm a mess.
Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But, in vino veritas as they say, I���m not gonna start doubting my drunken self now.
Look, Andrew, we can discuss the specifics of the job.
Well Nellie, I'm sorry. If I'd known Jim and Pam would use this party as an excuse to abuse a magician-
Yes. Dying alone, that is very scary. And how are you, Toby?
It's been a great year.
You like her.
This humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague. Excellent.
You���re blackmailing me.
Might as well have been sketching a cube.
A game or a match?
I don't think so.
Now why would you come to a bar and ask for a cola when you can get some from the kitchen? Did some small part of you want something a little stronger? Ryan, Kevin, Phyllis, Oscar, come and take these shots!
I miss being in a band.
Everyone's better than this, because this is the worst thing I have ever seen. [drinks coconut penis energy drink] Why'd they add coconut? I miss original.
Why did I choose Andy to run the office? Because he���s all surface, uncomplicated. What you see is what you get. Could be a recipe for mediocrity, yes, but then again, it might just be why people fight for him.
Here, use this one. [walking to Jim's desk]
[sees Jim's abandoned car] That's weird. Well, he's gotta be around here somewhere.
Absolutely.
Yes, hello, nice to meet you.
That sounds good.
Ah, well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. You wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. You���re gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. You don���t even know my real name. I���m the *bleep* lizard king. [disconnects]
You alright?
Sounded like mine.
Take a look at where you are, where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at it���s birth.  Those superstores are terrified of us.  Anybody know why?
Hello Jim. [Jim tries to escape]
They haven't really improved on the Oreo, have they?
[chuckling] Oh, you���d go someplace else.  That���s not it, that���s not the answer.
Hello Andy.
And you are aware that Columbus and his legions committed genocide against an entire civilization of Native Americans.
There we go.
Almost instinctively, she turned to her husband. 'Oh, wait,' she thought, 'I don't have a husband.' For Lydia and her husband had had an argument, one they couldn't get past. Each night, they slept one inch farther apart, until one night, Lydia left. It was about this time she lost herself in imaginary worlds. She had quit the book club, the choir, citing something about their high expectations. Her lips slowly grew together from disuse. Everytime she wanted to act and didn't, another part of her face hardened, until it was stone. And that fevered night, she rushed to the nursery, threw open the door, 'Baby, are you okay?' Baby sat up slowly, turned to mother and said, 'I'm fine, b!tch, I'm fine.'
Oh! Thank you. Uh���.
I should go.
Andy. Let���s see if there���s a good fit first. Then we���ll talk.
I actually appreciate the human intimacy. Feel like a kitten being cradled by a gorilla.
What should we play?
No, no, no, no. There's something going on. Some stress in your life.
Erin, it was great fun tonight. Take a few aspirin and a whole lot of water, sleep in in the morning.
No, he's going to meet with you later. No, no, no. I don't want you to rush it, okay? Trust me. Meet with Bill. He's a great person to know. I'll dialogue with him tonight. [leaves]
All right. Thanks.
[claps Andy's shoulder] Heh.
Oo, a little ice on that maybe.
Sesame Street was created to reflect the environment of the children watching it. Complete self-absorption of Elmo is brilliantly reflective of our time. Ours is a cultural ghetto. Wouldn���t you agree.
[laughs] This is an odd situation. But it's very interesting how it's playing out.
Jim, your daughter, Cecilia. What does she think of the street?
Oh.
I know you now, your nature. I'm done. Not worth continuing. [at the same time, Dwight says:  You don't know me! Anything about me! Get out of my head!]
People, you should come to work already warm. Nine to ten a.m. is the most productive potential that a human being-
Why can you not say exactly what I tell you? Undo this. Undo it. [Robert and Andy hang up phones]
What...is happening to me? [pause] The lines in your haggard face are paths that lead nowhere. Your hair is the fire of hell. [hugs Meredith] I sincerely hope you find a sexual partner tonight.
Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There���s no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems��� so poorly timed.
The state senator, Robert Lipton, loves dogs. he asked me if I loved dogs. you know what I said? Yes! [laughter.]
No, no. I'm very comfortable with all things sexual. Continue.
So, here what we can do. Game changers- changes to the game such that the game can never be played the same way again. Everyone, brainstorm some innovations. Don't be afraid to get weird with it. Meredith! [wakes her up] Excited!
Andy, Erin, you can join us now.
[on phone] Say hello grandma.
Oh, no, you-
Simply���end the mistakes
No, I'm certain you said basil.
You see, I sit across from a man. I see his face. I see his eyes. Now, does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deep-sea drilling equipment? Don't be a fool. He wants respect. He wants love. He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive. There is no such thing as a product. Don't ever think there is. There is only... sex. Everything... is sex. You understand that what I'm telling you is a universal truth,... Toby.
[laughing and clapping] Delightful.
I don't care, I don't care. Please come to work immediately.
Don���t worry. I���ve scheduled a press conference for later today. We just need to face the camera together. A beloved public servant and his devoted wife. And move on.
Ah���
Looks terribly real, doesn't it, Creed?
Let's help her out, shall we? Go above and beyond today to show her some of that warm Scranton hospitality. Jim. Dwight. Take the day. Help Nellie move those boxes into her new place.
Oscar. A pleasure.
Jim, come see this next room. I think you especially would like it.
Gabe, listen to me. Don't bother Bill with this. He has to go put out a fire on the home front. Just wait twenty minutes and then I want you to listen to Dwight's pitch. Make him feel valued. Make him feel heard.
Let's wait, until we have something to smoke about.
Let me tell you how I buy something these days.  I know what I want I go on the internet, I get the best price.  Or I don���t know what I want and I go to a small store that can help me.  The era of personal service is back. You are back.  You���ll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them ���you are welcome.��� [Applause] Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people.  Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen.  Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it.
Good morning, Robert,' says no one because our receptionist is in Florida. [no one responds] Pam!
Yes, Andrew. And you, on this day of fantasy, are a laborer.
Just taking a stroll. What exactly have I stumbled upon here?
Here we have the parlor. I imagined people would set down their coats and symbolically their inhibitions. This was the gateway. You enter this room a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher, a judge, but beyond it you're simply a penis, a vagina, hunger, ache. Susan used it as a Pilates studio.
Andrew, I think this may have been a bad idea. Why don't you let me pay for you and Erin to go out to a great romantic dinner tonight?
[Erin opens door] Erin.
Andy, it's Robert. Why aren't you at work?
Great. Thank you.
Well, you clearly want the marmalade. Gretchen, I need another marmalade. Alright. [hangs up]
Oh, look, Pin The Wart On The Wench. How did you know I was bringing my son?
Erin, what can I get for you?
Hi.
Oprah Winfrey's leadership academy and other schools like it, while wonderful, end with high school. I want to see these girls right through college, especially the gymnasts. They've lost so many years of crucial education to perfecting their bodies. Muscle groups the rest of us can't even fathom.
Not destroyed. No..... Not destructive. Quite...off-kilter, sure. But... that's too vague. [long pause] Erratic. Darkly erratic. [laughs awkwardly] That's my mood.
So I think you know what we want to know.
Dwight. Today is not my day at all, I'm afraid. I'm not going to be able to meet with you, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO.
Take it easy. Nice and easy.
Gentlemen, bear witness. While I've been mourning the nights that never were, one of them has been unfolding here before me. This is no get-together. This is a party. [Robert strips, jumps in pool, Gabe and Ryan join him]
Andrew, not everyone here is important. And the word is 'impotence.'
Why didn���t you simply ask Andy to clarify?  Asking is a very easy thing to do.  You���re obviously very close. [Andy and Erin look awkwardly at each other and Robert].  Oh I see.  This no longer seems like my business [Robert sits].
When I was a boy, there was an empty house just up the hill from my family's. It was rumored a man committed suicide there after being possessed by the devil. One day, a young woman, Lydia, moved into the house with her infant child. That very night, Lydia was awakened by a loud, heinous hissing sound. [hisses] She walked to the nursery, and there, in baby's crib, was a snake wrapped around baby's neck, squeezing tighter and tighter.
[on the computer screen] I would just to start by saying that there have been some rumors about my personal life that I would like to settle once and for all. As my long-suffering wife can attest��� I am gay.
We live in this world of routines and rhythms. Kevin ate someone's lunch. Phyllis has a new necklace. Who is this woman?
[laughing] Extraordinary. Did you plan this?
Yes.
I just think you guys are winners and I wanted to have lunch with you.
I almost didn't come in today. [laughs]
Wonderful.
You're both adults. I'm sure you can figure this out between yourselves.
Andrew, it's time for you to go home. You're better than this.
Are you sure?
When two animals are having sex, one of them...
Okay. My serve.
Pam, Pam, you���ve completely bungled this!
You people say I led you, but it wasn't me. You want to toast the man who led you to success, but the boss is irrelevant. Andy and I, we produce nothing. We do nothing. We sit in our offices and demand, I want this and that right now, like petulant children. You know, the difference between a crying baby and a manager, one day the baby will grow up. But, without you, Andy and I would be sitting in our dirty diapers, waiting for someone to change us, wipe us.  I should be toasting you, thanking you, for allowing me to have the easiest job in the universe. Cheers.
Shaping a company is, in a sense, similar to training a geisha. You have to mold not merely the physical form, but also the character. The two must harmonize. Are they still there? [camera pans to right, Harry, Dwight, and Jim watching Robert in conference room] They want a decision who gets the big client. Well, they can wait. I���ll still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime. You know, I trained as one.
You don't want to hear the other one. You love marmalade.
Andy why don't we discuss this at a--
Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me?
Now. Let's find you something fun to do here, shall we?
Double.
Let's get Jim in here. [Jim shoves out of fram in his chair, Robert looks for Jim] Where's Jim?
Jiminey Christmas indeed.
[chuckles] Please. Andrew, my wife... has brought up an issue that requires your attention. So, uh, if you'll excuse me, I should step out, get to the ATM before that homeless man sets up camp for the night.
Shopaholic.
[more emphatically than Jim] Yes. You do. [nods at the Search Committee, then looks over at the camera with a smirk on his face]
[loudly knocking on the window] In four seconds my wife is going to be coming through that door. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen. [to Mrs. California] There you are! Honey how on earth could you miss the elevator?
Big Mac idea.  That sounds encouraging.
Dwight! How nice of Gabe to show you where I live. Come around. 102.
Andy, can you inspire? Do you have that skill set?
Andrew sometimes I feel like you don't know me at all.
Let's you and I take a walk. Oscar, you're in charge of the bar.
[to the keyboardist, Curtis, and the drummer] Hey, you found us!
He just hung up on me mid-sentence.
Yeah.
-pep talk. Sexuality is a spectrum. It's a paradox to think of any sexual activity as 'normal.' It gets better but it also gets vastly more complicated.
You want a three and half day weekend for Columbus Day?
You were dining alone? All those people are you?
Hmm.
Andy, just answer the question.
Not much we can do about this until he gets here.
Andy would you be so kind as to show Susan around the office. Show her the various departments. Find a place where she���ll shine.
Ohh, unfortunately, yes.
It���s a wrong answer.
It's been ten days since I had sexual intercourse.
[enters] Oh, still here. Terrific.
Fine.
Dwight.
Yes, that's it. Push yourselves, boys. It's not a party if you don't do something that scares you. I need a breather. Oh. Oh. You two keep going.
Andy! Andy, could you step in here, please? We'll fix this.
Wine collection.
I once believed that a gay person could be somewhat straight. It wasn���t until my marriage to Angela that I realized how���charmless I find the female body.
The crib was full of dirt. Baby struggled to free itself from underneath, reaching and clawing, gasping for air. Embalmed bodies rose from their sarcophagi, lurching toward baby, for they were mummies.
Andrew, if you say no one more time, you're fired. So... is there anything else you wanna say?
[chuckles] I will get offered the job. That's a... call I've received many times. The slight hopefulness in their voice, the pregnant pause... while they wait to hear my response, and then... my response.
Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I could spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here.
I don't think you would have shown up to work nearly an hour late for no reason.
All life is sex. And all sex is competition.
Can everyone just, please��� I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and ��� how should I say this ��� Columbian whites. What ��� what is this about, uh, Binghamton?
How do you mean?
[speaking at the same time as andy] This is atrocious.
Lovely. Wait, where is this taking place?
Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor?
It���s true.  They���ve been preserved for thousands of years.  They���re all over.
no, Nellie, she-
Oh.
Thank you.
I never said that.
��� is communicating a message to the other. Nothing is mutua-- this isn't very helpful. You're gonna want to hear the sexual metaphor.
I love my wife.
[laughing] Nellie, really, nine fifty?
Well, that, that is what you want then, the marmalade.
[Andy continuously knocking on door] Yes, for god���s sake Andy. Yes, come in.
She likes you.
It's a basil plant.
This is preposterous.
Are you telling me that there���s no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands?
So, Thomas Oregon is an evil figure?
And there are no rules to that game. That wasn't so perverted, now was it?
Absolutely.
Great....ok.
Let me tell you some things I find productive. Positive reinforcement. Negative reinforcement. Honesty. I���ll tell you some things I find unproductive. Constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues. And then, inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so that you can get to sleep at night. No, I do not believe in that at all. If I invited you to lunch, I think you���re a winner. If I didn���t, I don���t. But I just met you all. Life is long, opinions change. Winners prove me right. Losers, prove me wrong.
I'll say a few words if that's alright with you, Andy.
Just fine, Kelly? Everything alright?
Double.
Andy, why don't you tell us about the best erection of your life? Or does anyone else have any remarkable erections they'd like to share? [Creed, Kevin and Meredith raise their hands]
[interrupting] I���m afraid you���ve lost my interest.
That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object... whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we've had already, you won't be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim?
I am not.
That was bad.
Yeah.
You're clearly under a lot of... stress with the moving and the work situation you've found yourself in.
I hope so. The corporate party was wretched. I am so tired of the Black Eyed Peas. It's rock-n-roll for people who don't like rock-n-roll. It's rap for people who don't like rap. It's pop for people who don't like pop.....ah, heartbreaking. [gestures to Andy in Santa costume]
When I come back next week and this report shows me no mistakes, we can talk about names, all day. Our favorite names, silly made up names, normal names said in a silly voice. Wouldn't that be nice?
Who else agrees with Kevin, that we're wasting facilities, manpower, on our underselling products when we should be pushing our top-performers? [everyone raises their hand, Robert laughs] There you go. Consensus.
I am not. Huh.
Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery.
No [laughs] my god.
Likewise, I'm Bob. Bob Kazamakis.
Nah, it's good.
No.
Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.
When I put in the screening room, I bought three movies: Caligula, Last Tango in Paris, and Emmanuelle 2. Last two movies I actually watched in here Marley and Me and On Golden [bleep] Pond.
Tell my wife you're lying.
Nellie?
[censored beep] ha, Jesus.
The fifth one is for you, Erin. You could take it or leave it. To take it would be to accept that you're at a party and you're an adult woman, with an adventurous spirit. To leave it would be fine too.
Whoa, no, wait, wait, wait, whoa. [tries to catch it with racket, misses, lands on floor]
What are your thoughts.
You know I suppose someone should enjoy the place before I hand it over to the staging experts at Remax tomorrow.  Let's try this: everyone, tonight, my house, wear a swimsuit. Let's just call it a get-together. And let's say no food.
Excuse me, has anyone seen Andy this morning?
I just did.
Oof. [laughs] Wouldn't wanna be a Sabre employee right about now. [laughs] I'm actually the CEO.
Is this a video conference you're having with 'Drake, featuring Swizz Beatz'?
Yes, ���course. Why don���t you list the things that would keep you from helping me.
[on the phone] Andrew, I've picked up two possible gifts to bring this afternoon. One, a pot of marmalade.
I also mentioned the marmalade to my sister and she's very interested.
The five day Hindu celebration in December honoring the god Ganesh, Patron of the Arts.
Guys, please help yourself to some drinks from the fridge.
Hold one finger up to Susan. You���ll just be a second. You numbskull. You were given a very simple task. I could not have been more clear with you. Now say, ���are you taking your medicine?���
You lying son of a bitch!
Andy, where shall I put your basil plant?
I've been married thrice and each has ended in an acrimonious divorce, I'm not sure I'm the best person to give love advice....I was hoping you were gonna make me feel better.
Oo!
Yeah, hello?
I'm sorry?
Dwight, the job is not right for you. Now, when something comes along that is right for you, I'll try you out. Now get the hell out of my place.
Do I look like someone who would waste my own time?
If the office superstore was supposed to put us little suppliers out of business, why are we still here?
Harry���
You guys mind if they join us?
I pictured myself here every night eating a leg of mutton, the juices dripping down my bare chest, wiping my fingers on the walls. Then I met the vegan.
Are we done?
You guess? So, there is something you want that you do not have.
This room I liked for the view. I dreamed that I would watch my guests walk to their cars at dawn, their faces flushed with the shame and regret for the choices they made the night before. [laughs]
Par for the course. Par for the...freaking course. I'll be in the party room having a cookie until 11. Haha! Yule-log.
Mmm. Wow.
Oh, that sounds nice.
There���s something about an underdog that really inspires���the unexceptional.
I'm just so touched that she's so interested in my work.
Oh, hi there.
Ah.
[to Dwight] Why is Jim treating the magician poorly?
Kevin, you've been quiet. I'm curious to know what your game-changer is.
What are we talking about?
Amongst them was a man, tall, slim.
I had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. Total waste of two bears.
Join us. You must see what you were laughing about.
Ah, please. Here���s what it is. It���s a doodle.
No, no.
Jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times.
Can you call security, tell 'em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this.
Can I have it?
My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn't he decide who the manager is?
[laughing] Kevin!
Cheers.
There���s someone else I need to thank. His name is Oscar Martinez.
The ticketing software paints a picture of a sloppy, careless, error prone office.
I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said��� [Andy walks out]
What's the struggle? He made a great call, hired a great person.
I saw an episode of how they make paper on Sesame Street. [nods at Dwight mockingly]
No, that's absolutely the case.
End the mistakes. That is all I ask. [gets up from chair] And you can't have a favorite Iron Chef. It depends entirely on the secret ingredient. Sometimes I feel you don't know food at all.
It's the standard one. The one everyone has.
I'm selling the house, actually.
[enters room, everyone quiets and separates] I���d like to invite the following people to join me for lunch: Jim, Dwight, Angela, Darryl, Kevin, Toby, Phyllis, Oscar.
Haha! There he is. You mind lending a hand? I'm typing up a memo to share your ideas with the board.
I���m never uncomfortable.
I would be eternally grateful. It���s not a bad thing to have the CEO owe you one.
Shalom. [sighs] Give us just a minute. Stu and I are just finishing up our lesson. Trust me. One nine-minute bout is a cardiovascular equivalent of running uphill for three hours. [grunt] I could go to the gym three times a week or I can wrestle Stu once a month. [slaps the mat, they wrestle]
I did not know about the sales figures.
I can expense it.
It depends Jim. Do you find one-day only Jet Blue sales to Buffalo interesting?
Where did this come from? Did Andy say that?
Sit down, Dwight.
You can just put it down.
It seems Andy is the only one with this problem. Fascinating.
You feeling fulfilled in your life?
Jim, you alright? What are you doing?
Because it's too terrifying to imagine. Now we're cooking. What is it, Kelly? What is this great fear of yours?
It's a command.
Everyone, conference room, now. [Dwight and Gabe stand up, falling over]
Pam, when���s the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn���t hold the memories in?
Who is it?
Everyone. I���d like to introduce my wife Mrs. Robert California. Mrs. California this is everyone.
I'll see you next week Will. [at the club, playing squash]
It's mid-recession in a depressed area of a faltering state and I've got the most expensive house on the market. The one percent are suffering too, people. I wanted it to be my Playboy mansion. A temple to wine, revelry, sex, intrigue... this was hot on the heels of Eyes Wide Shut, mind you. Then I met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. Now she's left me and forced me to sell the place. The ultimate insult? They're calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room. [Jim laughs] Does my turmoil amuse you, Jim?
Last week an accounting mistake resulted in a client getting their order for free.
I don���t- I don���t wanna say-
No.
Thank you.
Sometimes the flowers arrange themselves, Jim.
I'm not accustomed to people saying no to me. [laughs]
Oh my.  It was just actually cookies the whole time?
Please. [laughs]
Andy, why don't you just take a seat?
Who are they?
Andy you should leave. Now.
Nellie.
Thank you. Why do we love dogs? Want me to tell you why? There is no answer. Our love for them confounds reason!
Well you can't say no.
We'll talk. [walks away]
Oscar is the one who opened my eyes to who I really am. For the first time���
Where can I get a drink? Oh...
I���m not gonna change my list, Andy, and I don���t use ballpoint pens.
A beautiful monster cost me my forties and my dream home. I think I'm entitled to the occasional bad day.
Cookies. Cookie placement.
[on the computer screen] I���ll say it again for mis amigos latinos. Yo soy homosexual.
Ugh, I hate ties! I feel like I'm being strangled like I'm at some erotic asphyxiation sex club over on I-84. The red room say? Or Dominick's?
To the kitchen. Onward!
Who's pumped for the quarter finals, huh?
My body has somehow become acclimated to southern Italy. Isn't that strange? I've never been there! Oh, ah, yes, that's nice. Thank you.
I was looking over your projections, and I think we can do better.
I'd love to give you a little rundown on what I've learned about this place.
Hey, my friend, trust me. This is for the best. I never understood that corporate mess.
Now then, how are we today?
Nellie! You've been terrific in your interim capacity. But, Andrew is the rightful manager so if you would just give him his office-
Let���s do it now. What���s number one?
I never allow sexual desire to influence a business decision. So I find it best to excuse myself temporarily until I've had a chance to make love and then go back and analyze the situation rationally. Buffett operates the same way.
Right.  I mean you���re an accountant.  Those bogus prospectuses must drive you insane.
No.
I am the CEO and I am telling an employee of mine what to do.
Elmo, god���s sake, it���s the Elmo era.
