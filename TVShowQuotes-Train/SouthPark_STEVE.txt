Token?  Alright, Token. We know you must be very confused about what you saw. 
Nonononono no, listen, listen: if I didn't answer your questions, then we have given bad customer service!
Yes, hello. This call may be recorded to ensure good customer service in the future.
All righty, if you guys keep this up, we'll raise the money for summer camp in no time! 
Hey, wait a second. You mean that this whole thing was just a setup by your mom?
All right. Well, just keep working on those donations. 
Oh yeah, the Prime Minister, eh? He sure has screwed up things for Newfoundland. Life just hasn't been the same since he made sodomy illegal.
Listen carefully, my friend. You are stuck in a paradox. It turns out there are three things you cannot do in virtual reality. You cannot die, you cannot get grounded, and you cannot call Customer Service. This is why you are having problems.
Oh God. One of them is a war veteran.  We're gonna have to give him some change.
Yeah. And you all went the wrong direction on it.
Uhhh, nononono my friend. I am Steve with Customer Service.
What? But Token's never seen a porno before. He wouldn't know what to—Oh God! 
The people you are talking to are just computer programs, my friend.
Hey boys, are you excited for camp next year?
A big congratulations to our fundraising champion! After selling the Handicar rights to Elon Musk, Timmy has raised 2.3 billion dollars for summer camp.  Great job to all of you. This is sure to be the best summer camp ever! 
But the customer service - was that reliable? And did I accurately and politely respond to your concerns?
Let us in! For God's sake, they're coming! No! No, I'm sorry, we don't have any change.
I know this is very hard for you, but we don't have a lot of time.
Ohhh yes yes yes! That I can answer! His name was... But-ters!
Of course, we could always take my boat, eh?
Hello, Eric. My name is Steve from Oculus Customer Service. There seems to be an error with our virtual headsets, and on behalf of the company, I would like to apologize and try to help.
Hello, hello my friend, are you still there?
Have I answered your questions satisfactorily and offered GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE?!
Have I answered all your questions in a satisfying and courteous manner?
All right, did I take care of all your customer needs in a timely and satisfactory fashion today?
Yeah, we gave it our best, but our best wasn't good enough, eh? 
My friend, my friend, a customer who is in virtual reality called Customer Service, and it has created a customer feedback loop. Okay? Here in India we call it a customer feedback vindaloop.
Francis has raised $29.32  And Timmy has raised $2,063.00!
Ohh yehhs, yes. What is your name please?
That does not matter! There is only one thing that matters!
Listen, my friend. This is gong to be very hard to comprehend, but none of what you are seeing is real.
Nononononono, do not fuck me, because I am you and then we will just be fucking ourselves. Now, have I provided answers to your questions in a courteous and prompt fashion?
Oh, yes, ah, yes my friend.  Oculus Customer Service, this is Steve.
Well what is more important, my friend? The result, or good customer service?
He doesn't care! I can continue! All right, listen very carefully my friend. The headsets we sold you are having some minor problems.
Yes, no, sorry, but because you bought two business-class tickets I can NOT refund the fares.  That's right, there is nothing we can do. All right. Have I answered all your customer concerns in a timely, polite manner? Thank you for calling Korean Airlines Customer Service.  El Pollo Loco Customer Service, this is Steve.
Ohhhh yes yes yes yes. Many people are calling about this. We have NO idea what's going on. Have I answered all your questions in a timely manner?
I understand your shock, my friend, but you have simply been in the virtual world so long you have forgotten.
Oh no, you don't! You're my girl! And I'm not lettin' you walk out on me!  What the?! 
This is going to be very jarring for you, but, there has been a malfunction with the headset you ordered from us. Right now, you're actually in your room at your computer wearing an Oculus headset, but, you're in a coma-like trance, my friend.
That's the paradox! Please my friend, please! I am not real! You are not real! Have I answered your questions and provided good customer service?! This call may be recorded! 
Kyle. I need to advise you that this call may be recorded to help with better customer service in the future. Is that agreeable to you?
Not just a sec! We've got a whole lot of wet campers down there!  What's going on?! 
What do you mean have you answered all my questions?! NO! You have not answered ANY questions at ALL!
Uhhh let's see, ah, it looks like... one of you is going to have to put on the Oculus headset and go into the virtual world and convince your friend to get to an access point. Could you try that, my friend? 
Yes. And that is why we are trying to locate all the headsets and do a recall. Do you understand? It is a Total Recall.
I I have others with me. We we have nowhere else to go. One woman here is pregnant.
