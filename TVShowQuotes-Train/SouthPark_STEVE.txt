Listen carefully, my friend. You are stuck in a paradox. It turns out there are three things you cannot do in virtual reality. You cannot die, you cannot get grounded, and you cannot call Customer Service. This is why you are having problems.
That's the paradox! Please my friend, please! I am not real! You are not real! Have I answered your questions and provided good customer service?! This call may be recorded! 
Ohhhh yes yes yes yes. Many people are calling about this. We have NO idea what's going on. Have I answered all your questions in a timely manner?
This is going to be very jarring for you, but, there has been a malfunction with the headset you ordered from us. Right now, you're actually in your room at your computer wearing an Oculus headset, but, you're in a coma-like trance, my friend.
Hey, wait a second. You mean that this whole thing was just a setup by your mom?
Hello, hello my friend, are you still there?
Uhhh, nononono my friend. I am Steve with Customer Service.
Oh, yes, ah, yes my friend.  Oculus Customer Service, this is Steve.
Token?  Alright, Token. We know you must be very confused about what you saw. 
All right, kids, you know what time of year this is?  That's right, it's autumn! And that means our fundraising for next year's summer camp is in full gear. Is everyone psyched for next year's summer camp?
Have I answered your questions satisfactorily and offered GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE?!
A big congratulations to our fundraising champion! After selling the Handicar rights to Elon Musk, Timmy has raised 2.3 billion dollars for summer camp.  Great job to all of you. This is sure to be the best summer camp ever! 
Panasonic customer service. How can I help you?
Yes, hello. This call may be recorded to ensure good customer service in the future.
Kyle. I need to advise you that this call may be recorded to help with better customer service in the future. Is that agreeable to you?
Oh no, you don't! You're my girl! And I'm not lettin' you walk out on me!  What the?! 
Oh God. One of them is a war veteran.  We're gonna have to give him some change.
Just hover, honey. They can't do anything if we're just hovering.
What do you mean have you answered all my questions?! NO! You have not answered ANY questions at ALL!
What? But Token's never seen a porno before. He wouldn't know what to—Oh God! 
Ohhh yes yes yes! That I can answer! His name was... But-ters!
My friend, my friend, a customer who is in virtual reality called Customer Service, and it has created a customer feedback loop. Okay? Here in India we call it a customer feedback vindaloop.
Yeah, we gave it our best, but our best wasn't good enough, eh? 
I I have others with me. We we have nowhere else to go. One woman here is pregnant.
Hey boys, are you excited for camp next year?
Not just a sec! We've got a whole lot of wet campers down there!  What's going on?! 
All right. Well, just keep working on those donations. 
All right, did I take care of all your customer needs in a timely and satisfactory fashion today?
All righty, if you guys keep this up, we'll raise the money for summer camp in no time! 
Nononononono, do not fuck me, because I am you and then we will just be fucking ourselves. Now, have I provided answers to your questions in a courteous and prompt fashion?
Let us in! For God's sake, they're coming! No! No, I'm sorry, we don't have any change.
That does not matter! There is only one thing that matters!
Well what is more important, my friend? The result, or good customer service?
Yeah. And you all went the wrong direction on it.
I understand your shock, my friend, but you have simply been in the virtual world so long you have forgotten.
Francis has raised $29.32  And Timmy has raised $2,063.00!
Nonononono no, listen, listen: if I didn't answer your questions, then we have given bad customer service!
Hello, Eric. My name is Steve from Oculus Customer Service. There seems to be an error with our virtual headsets, and on behalf of the company, I would like to apologize and try to help.
Yes, no, sorry, but because you bought two business-class tickets I can NOT refund the fares.  That's right, there is nothing we can do. All right. Have I answered all your customer concerns in a timely, polite manner? Thank you for calling Korean Airlines Customer Service.  El Pollo Loco Customer Service, this is Steve.
He doesn't care! I can continue! All right, listen very carefully my friend. The headsets we sold you are having some minor problems.
Hello? My friend? My friend, I believe we are having some technical issues with our phone line. Please hang on, I'm going to call Customer Service.
Of course, we could always take my boat, eh?
But you didn't answer any of my questions!
But the customer service - was that reliable? And did I accurately and politely respond to your concerns?
Listen, my friend. This is gong to be very hard to comprehend, but none of what you are seeing is real.
Oh yeah, the Prime Minister, eh? He sure has screwed up things for Newfoundland. Life just hasn't been the same since he made sodomy illegal.
Yes. And that is why we are trying to locate all the headsets and do a recall. Do you understand? It is a Total Recall.
