Kyle. I need to advise you that this call may be recorded to help with better customer service in the future. Is that agreeable to you?

Just hover, honey. They can't do anything if we're just hovering.

That does not matter! There is only one thing that matters!

All right, did I take care of all your customer needs in a timely and satisfactory fashion today?

Nononononono, do not fuck me, because I am you and then we will just be fucking ourselves. Now, have I provided answers to your questions in a courteous and prompt fashion?

I know this is very hard for you, but we don't have a lot of time.

What do you mean have you answered all my questions?! NO! You have not answered ANY questions at ALL!

Have I answered your questions satisfactorily and offered GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE?!

Yeah. And you all went the wrong direction on it.

The people you are talking to are just computer programs, my friend.

Yes. And that is why we are trying to locate all the headsets and do a recall. Do you understand? It is a Total Recall.

Oh yeah, the Prime Minister, eh? He sure has screwed up things for Newfoundland. Life just hasn't been the same since he made sodomy illegal.

Oh, yes, ah, yes my friend.  Oculus Customer Service, this is Steve.

Hello, hello my friend, are you still there?

Token?  Alright, Token. We know you must be very confused about what you saw. 

Listen, my friend. This is gong to be very hard to comprehend, but none of what you are seeing is real.

Oh no, you don't! You're my girl! And I'm not lettin' you walk out on me!  What the?! 

Ohhhh yes yes yes yes. Many people are calling about this. We have NO idea what's going on. Have I answered all your questions in a timely manner?

Hey boys, are you excited for camp next year?

All right. Well, just keep working on those donations. 

Nonononono no, listen, listen: if I didn't answer your questions, then we have given bad customer service!

Hey, wait a second. You mean that this whole thing was just a setup by your mom?

Ohhh yes yes yes! That I can answer! His name was... But-ters!

Have I answered all your questions in a satisfying and courteous manner?

Uhhh, nononono my friend. I am Steve with Customer Service.

My friend, my friend, a customer who is in virtual reality called Customer Service, and it has created a customer feedback loop. Okay? Here in India we call it a customer feedback vindaloop.

Francis has raised $29.32  And Timmy has raised $2,063.00!

Hello, Eric. My name is Steve from Oculus Customer Service. There seems to be an error with our virtual headsets, and on behalf of the company, I would like to apologize and try to help.

Panasonic customer service. How can I help you?

Well what is more important, my friend? The result, or good customer service?

Ohh yehhs, yes. What is your name please?

Yeah, we gave it our best, but our best wasn't good enough, eh? 

But you didn't answer any of my questions!

Of course, we could always take my boat, eh?

Not just a sec! We've got a whole lot of wet campers down there!  What's going on?! 

Let us in! For God's sake, they're coming! No! No, I'm sorry, we don't have any change.

Yes, no, sorry, but because you bought two business-class tickets I can NOT refund the fares.  That's right, there is nothing we can do. All right. Have I answered all your customer concerns in a timely, polite manner? Thank you for calling Korean Airlines Customer Service.  El Pollo Loco Customer Service, this is Steve.

He doesn't care! I can continue! All right, listen very carefully my friend. The headsets we sold you are having some minor problems.

Uhhh let's see, ah, it looks like... one of you is going to have to put on the Oculus headset and go into the virtual world and convince your friend to get to an access point. Could you try that, my friend? 

Hello? My friend? My friend, I believe we are having some technical issues with our phone line. Please hang on, I'm going to call Customer Service.

That's the paradox! Please my friend, please! I am not real! You are not real! Have I answered your questions and provided good customer service?! This call may be recorded! 

This is going to be very jarring for you, but, there has been a malfunction with the headset you ordered from us. Right now, you're actually in your room at your computer wearing an Oculus headset, but, you're in a coma-like trance, my friend.

I I have others with me. We we have nowhere else to go. One woman here is pregnant.

All right, kids, you know what time of year this is?  That's right, it's autumn! And that means our fundraising for next year's summer camp is in full gear. Is everyone psyched for next year's summer camp?

I understand your shock, my friend, but you have simply been in the virtual world so long you have forgotten.

All righty, if you guys keep this up, we'll raise the money for summer camp in no time! 

Oh God. One of them is a war veteran.  We're gonna have to give him some change.
