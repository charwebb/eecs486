Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?
[on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]
Alright. [they stand up] Excuse me.[They sit down] I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal...
I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.
Yes!  I think we should look into that.  If you could just speak up louder...
Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?
It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?
So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?
[to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.
You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
I didn't ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away]
Oh, just somewhere in the Poconos. I was just surfing.
Alright.  I'll tell everybody here that you say hi.
Oh, um. [pulls item from bag and hands to Pam] Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it.
Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.
I wasn't. But thank you. [to Pam] Do you know anything about this party?
I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.
Yeah, we did. Hey, how long���how long do we think that���s gonna take?
That is a lie, that is a lie.
Nothing much.  Let me ask you something.  It's actually little awkward.
I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.
[bounces ball off wall with Toby] So that's what this sound is all day.
You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  We'll be fine.
I was blue group, so it was second from the top.
I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. [holds up same book] I've only sold one copy.
Check this out though, spin serve. [serves, and Dwight scores] Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...
And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.  [everyone claps and makes comments]
Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
So how does it work? It���s like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or���
Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? [Karen smiles and gives herself away] Wow. Ok. You got me.
Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.
Wow.  Um, ok. [pops Dwight's orb with scissors]
Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.
Yeah, I'm aware of that.  But he's also being super annoying.  And I'm not a perfect person.
Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?
Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?
Okay, guys, guys, guys. That almost sounded like business, and we are trying to focus here today, okay?
Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just...
Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' and everyone's just staring at her.
Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.
Let���s not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you���re expecting a fax today, please don���t yell out, ���Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.��� Ok? That���s nonsense.
[Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you're going up there?
Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...
Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
Wow. [sees guy at Erin's desk] Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar.
Um, thank you, Ryan, uh, I don't know, I think I made the mistake one day of telling someone that I like penguins, and here we are.
[as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.
Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?
I'll make it worth your while, I promise.
I don���t know how else to tell you, okay? I���m doing everything I can every week to bring home something...
We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.
[on phone] I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
No, I told you I don���t like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.
Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?
I think I did a pretty good job.
You know, that's probably not gonna last too long, you should go to a hospital and get a real cast.
Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?
Alright, alright, gang. Let's just settle down. You're yelling in her face.
No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.
Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back.
No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar?
Okay, you know what, Dwight. What if you got a really serious disease like Ebola.
Yeah. All right. Bye. [Kevin sinks putt] All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?
No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
Well that's great.  [shakes Ryan's hand] You're talking about your court ordered community service?
Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?
[laughs and swings his arm out which doesn't come close to touching the reception desk] I'm always this close.
Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.
[chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.
[louder] ���Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!���
That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
Well, Pam I'm not gonna lie to you, he's chances are none. Um, he's 41 years old, he is losing his hair and his cell phone ring is 'Mambo #5.' So...
[explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it's a tradeoff.
Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans!
Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
[Jim's phone goes to voicemail] This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.
[hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down]
Oh, it���s happening!  Let���s just keep it between you and me for right now.
I really felt like I almost lost her, and���and nothing is worth that.
Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.
Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.
Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood.
[Gets up and looks out Nellie���s office window] He���s running!
DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island?  Yes! Meredith?
Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.  [someone dims the lights, signifying that it's game time]  Ok, see you next week.  Bye.  [to Karen] Again?
Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.
And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.
Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.
Actually if I had fewer outside classes, I probably wouldn't be stuck here at a paper company.
Pam, Pam, it's time.  Let's go to the hospital.
OH, that's great. I'm really happy for [starts to walk away]
[Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?
Animation? All her by the way. [points at Pam]
I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?
Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.
Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.
Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole 'Woody came to life' thing so quickly?
Well, you seem to have this under control.
Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.
Okay.  Sshh.  I know.  [hands the baby to Pam]
This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah.
What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
Yes! [as other costumed actors come in and join Andy in song]
[shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.
Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.
Okay, the limo���s gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready ���cause I want to pack in a lot.
...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.
But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!
Hey dude, you know what a 'rundown' is?
Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn���t going to show up?
[on cell phone] Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.
Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90.
Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over?
You're right, we didn't dance.  It was more like, swaying.  But still romantic.
[silently counting] Three, two, one... [Erin turns on the office lights, all laugh loudly]
Um, this one interesting the power comes from the font in this one. 'Schrute Space,' very medieval, very England. Um, this one's forceful, this one's very Dwight. 'Quiet! Dwight Schrute Working,' it's good.
I... Why would you just say something like that?
Oh. You don't have to tell me this.
DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim.
Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  [cell phone rings; Dwight's voice saying 'Idiot, Idiot, Idiot'] Oh, that's my new 'Dwight' ring.
I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.
Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.
Mmm, that's where you're wrong.  I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require.  So, I think we should go get some.  Now, please.
[driving, sighs, laughs] No. you know what? No. Because... I'm not that guy. And [laughs] we are not that couple. [turns around]
Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses.  Uh, four dollars.  And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble.  And that's a grand total of... [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars.
Oh, I just mean if you, if you didn't lock the door, then we could be upstairs where it's warmer.
Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...
Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then... [reading text message] 'How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight.'
Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.
If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...
I don't know. Hey, have you seen my baby?
You didn't hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?
Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine.  So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along.
[Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.
For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin���
I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
[Philip is crying] I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?
Okay.  That is me, but I didn't order the cake.
I bought it.  It's ours.  Let's go inside, I'll show you inside.  [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor.  Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet.  Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall]  Yeah, I am really sorry about this.  I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there.  Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.  [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so... [shuts the door]
Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.
Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.
It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out.  We're not going under.
Are you really sure we should be leaving?
Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.
Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?
You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
Oh no, no, no. That's ok. [Jim shoves some snacks in his pocket as he gets out of limo] Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center?
By the way, man, this place is... beautiful.
But you said that you went out with her this weekend.
Um... Whoa. [picks up ringing phone][in managerial voice] Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm  hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.
So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.
I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
No, I hear what you���re saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?
So, you just couldn't take it anymore, huh?
Chapter 2 ��� Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.
Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I���m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don���t worry, he���s the best in the biz.
Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.
Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
I don't know. [looks at Stanley, who took his mug and is drinking out of it] Oh! That's... not... yours.
Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.
OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad.
Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?
Are you sure you���re okay with me putting in this much money.
I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --
Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly.
Why did I transfer to Stamford?  I think that's pretty obvious.  I got promoted!  And you can't beat that view... right?
So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
I'm excited, I've actually never been to Gettysburg. Uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so I freaked out and we turned the car around. But I'm older now, I can outrun a zombie.
Party looks fun doesn���t it?  Everybody seems to be in there having a great time.  So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.
Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
I love Star Wars as much as the next guy���
Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
Dwight, you wrote that memo. Okay, it's not an official memo.
Do we all have our copy of 'Threat Level: Midnight', by Michael Scott?
Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor.
[Pam starts sipping an empty glass] I think those might be empty.
And I took it right back. It was like...
[sings] Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,
[getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks.
Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.
If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her.  It'll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy.  Uh... June.  Summer.  So, that'll be nice.  And that's that.
Okay, so what do you want to do?
Chapter seven: The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.
I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.
Well, we���re here. Perfect. ��[covers sleeping Phyllis with his jacket]
You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.
Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?
Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.
Travel.  I've been looking forward to it.  It's gonna be... really nice.  Gonna find myself.
I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...
It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.
Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It���s really great.
It���s pretty great, right? I mean, we���re coming along��� [to coworker] Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis���s timeline
[Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.
You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.
Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.
Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten...
Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.
Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?
Ok, we didn't dance.  I was totally joking anyway.  I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance.  Right?
Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing...
Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right.
All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.
Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal.
Every time there's a silence, your brain's like 'Heh-heh-huh-huh' [imitating crying].
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us all to believe that he was the father... by telling us he was the father.  But then we got this e-mail from Jan.  [waves paper and reads from it] 'Hi, everyone!  Jan here, writing to share some wonderful news and to quash a rumor.  First, the great news - I am expecting.  The beautiful baby inside me will be ready to meet the world this fall just a few months before the launch of the new Serenity by Jan line (shameless plug, I know, don't hate me, LOL).  Anyway, I also wanted to clarify that the father is not anyone that you or I have ever met.  Remember, no matter how excited someone is about my baby, it does not make them the father.  Best, Jan.  P.S. Hope to ship you something soon.'
Yeah, was it 10? Yeah, I have it on a mix tape from junior high.
Hey. I was just about to call you.
Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?
I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
No- Ok. Well, we'll talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?
What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!
Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.
[sings Olympic theme song] This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.
No, I won't.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.
I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.
Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, she's so beautiful!  Oh, my God.
Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be
Andy revealed himself to be a double agent.  At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent.  And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent.  Oh, and it is 6:00.
I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So...  I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--
[Jan enters the office, pushing a stroller] Jan.
Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.
Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey.
[grunts] Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?
Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
I think you should do it. That's great!
I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.
Hey! There she is. [Pam laughs] How you doin?
You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.
I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.
Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?
Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.
Mad?  How could I be mad?  We're having a little girl.
Oh.  He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.
Sure, yeah. [laughs] Hollywood. [Ryan Howard pulls out 3 thick scripts] Alright.
Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands - including Pam]
[reading from computer] ���Side effects of EMF include: headaches...���
[on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.
Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.
Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
[Turns off Dwight's music] Whether it's this time or next time.
Yeah, I'd say she's happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8:00 AM.
[driving] I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should. [sighs]
How would that work in well?  I just want to know.
Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.
It is... more of a spicy brown, actually.
Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who���s the strongest? Well, there���s only one way to solve that ��� flat curl contest.
[on voicemail] Hey, it's Jim.  Leave a message.
Wait, should I have left the car running? [both laugh]
New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?
Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that.
Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.
Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!
We got to see Ping.  [Pam nods] And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. [Pam nods] Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. [Pam nods] Which for me, has ruined them for life. [looks at Pam, who is staring at him, nodding]
Uh��� [clears throat] Well, it���s about Athlead. I���m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?
I'm gonna write you up for not working.
Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.
[laughs] What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?
Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?
Honestly, I don't mind. [long, awkward pause until thermos is empty] Did you want me to wash it for you or...
What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?
And in this room here, if you look closely, you will find out a few clues about who lives here.  Um, he likes biking, obviously, and uh, what else?  Uh, he likes tour guides, I guess.  And if you're very perceptive, you'll notice that he didn't do a great job of cleaning his room [kicks water bottle under bed].  Ok, and uh, that's the tou-
All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.
Well, the group tour is now leaving, then.  Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows.  I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.
Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
I have one, too. Jim. Jim, Is Jim. My name is Jim.
Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right?
Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?
If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.
Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.
It's not--- It's not about me.  I mean, this your dream.
I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?
This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.
Come on, Michael says we should go now.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this.
fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,
Oh, Andy.  You know what?  We don't have a
Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he���ll be calling in any second.
No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back.
Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings]
I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening.
Things are a little bit... different here in Stamford. [shrug] It's not bad.
Oh, there's no game.  We're just trying to get these chips for Karen.
So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try.
Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually.
[approaching Reception] Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?
Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.
[under breath] Oh, no, not while I'm here.
Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.
Hey. It���s nothing. Alright? I���ll text you when we get there. Let you know what���s going on.
Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
Huh. Well, you know, you can���t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what���s most important. That���s my new thing.
[To Dwight] So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?
[Dwight imitates the 'Jim face'] Look at that.
[looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off]
Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company.
I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- [pulls out a pie chart] How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.
Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?
Where do you want to go for dinner?
Great. [to a group of guests]  Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.
Nope. Can���t accept that job. It���s not a real job.
Oh, tomorrow, that's gonna be tough 'cause I already laid out my outfit, so...
Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?
No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay [others enter] Hey everybody!
Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?
I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in.
What about a gift basket full of cash?
That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
Michael went in there with him too.  It's pretty sweet.
Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?
[takes her hand] Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, you're so pretty.
We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.
You're only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but.
[ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.
You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.
All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to.
Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?
Nah, you definitely weren���t kidding.  And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. [hands Andy slip of paper]
You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?
[listening to and editing Jo's book on tape]
What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me���[gets interrupted by Andy].
...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but...
Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday.  So, keep that goin'.
Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.
That's a good one. [a red sports car drives up] Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?
And who cares?  It's a stupid veil, right?
We need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
[to Michael] Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.
Okay. I���m really sorry I told the guys I���d be there for the board meeting.
I forgot if there was an 'e' between the 'l' and the 'y.' I still don't know.
Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of ���Pilot���]
Barely, I... I don't have all the facts.  Frank and Bean...
Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this���
Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.
[on phone, leaving a message] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. [hangs up and exhales sharply]
Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?
OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.
Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
[outside] So I'm still in the process of converting the garage.  It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect [opens garage door] for an art studio.  [Pam looks around and then looks at him] Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---
Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?
Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
Is that not what happens when you're high?
Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...that's it. That's really all we were looking for.
You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.
Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can���t give 100% to two things at once you know.
[drawing two family trees on a whiteboard] Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through [draws a question mark] delusion.
Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on. [to everyone] Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. [to Katy] Desert Island. Five movies. Go.
Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped.
[in the kitchen] Oh, here's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-
Yes! Phyllis! [claps] Phyllis, just put your foot right through here [lifts strap on box of paper]. Right through the flonk.
You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.
Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works.
I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.
Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.
That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we don't need a new system though.  Happy with ours.
Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but...
No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!
Dwight, it's not a factory at all. Do you have to do what you are doing? [Dwight is tapping each of the bobble heads on his desk and making them bobble]
What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?
I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates...
Phyllis says the same twelve clich��s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.
So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.
Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years.
Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.
[both laugh] You know that I was doin' this.
How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.'
Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?
I think she'd be a really good salesperson.
I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise. [taps Bluetooth earpiece] Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.
I [drops out] at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please don't call again.
Yeah, oh, I know. Looks great. [Dwight throws the purse over his right shoulder and gets back to work]
Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.
The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ...
Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
No, no. I want to hear you tell it.
OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.
Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss.
Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding.
[Michael steals the ball] Yeah, Michael. Go Michael. [makes shot]
Alright, let's conference room it up! [everyone is now in the conference room]  Here's the deal guys.  There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.
Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---
No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.
That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can ..
So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.
Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.
Slowly, slowly.  Let's just get to the elevator.
I don't know because I everything I own is there.
I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.
[Pam is asleep, resting her head on Jim's shoulder] Um... Hey.
Mm, hey driver. Why don���t you take us to 3030 Adams?
Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.
Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?
I won't.  But, you will wash and buff our car.
[imitating game announcer] You win. [Darryl throws empty can on floor] How good did that feel?
Oh do you mean when I get the job?
Is that... I didn't know that was your... okay, so we're in agreement, this is not ideal... situation.
I think I left my wallet in your house.
I looked at you coming around, and I said, ���Wintergreen.���
That���s obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
Uh, I can't get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can't...
Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...
Yeah, alright Kev why don���t you come with us?
[on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.
My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this.
That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot.
15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.
Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... [Pam starts laughing]... spy on our other branch. No no no.
I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn���t love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid���wonderful���boring���amazing job.
Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen...[Jim bites his lip again] You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!
Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...
Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question.
Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.
Okay, you could just say you don't know what's going on.
It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
He's just mad that we're all having fun.
Cece���s really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these.
Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you...
Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen.
Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or...
You know he's doing all this on purpose.
What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
Will do. [hangs up]  I'll stop calling.  [walks into lobby]
Good one? [Toby puts on the lens cover and scurries away awkwardly] That's a cool camera.
Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.
[talking on phone] You sound tired. Everything ok?
Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it���s a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...
Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?
Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.
Well, turns out he actually made it up there.
That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
[playing Call of Duty] Oh? Someone's left out in the open, taking a little siesta. Not smart. [shoots] Yes! Finally killed you... [Karen's desk is empty]
Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?
I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.
Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with.
Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we���d save her from Ryan right?
Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?
I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.
Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?
Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!
And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
You know what?  Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition?  I'd love to see that dunk of yours.
Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos.
You know what it���s not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-
I���ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I���d be proud to take.
Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?
No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, 'world's longest engagement', um, we're all expecting it, you know?
I can always kind of win at roulette.
Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.
[laughs] Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.
Okay. Have you ever seen the movie Sixth Sense? Maybe you are already dead.
That's impossible. [Dwight climbs through ceiling hatch] Dwight!
Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.
Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.
Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.
OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.
Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?
Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.
Customers have to use the coupon code from the website.  And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.
[pointing to computer monitor] So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view. [picture of Dwight and Mose on a see-saw]
Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] 'The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert.' Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.
I'd hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70's theme party, or a 70's theme meeting, or a 70's theme convention...
Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it.
Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something.
Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-
And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.
Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.
Jan didn't come back for her car last night.
I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?
Either way, Dwight��� I can���t be there for you. I���m sorry.
Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.
Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger.
This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.
So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word 'Philadelphia'?
Oh, hey, man. [Daryl walks over to Jim, angrily and stares at Jim] Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview.
Here you go again! What is your deal today?
Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]
You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?
Good advice Beesley.  Thanks.  See you out there.
[on the phone] Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!
I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment,  is the only one who raises her hand]
Not even a thought!  It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!
Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open.
Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that. [Dwight smiles at Jim] Really? Smirking?
No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.
I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies [holds up index cards] - that's just unfair.
Another bullets heads towards Agent Michael Scarn, but he jumps out of the plane without a parachute.
So I guess I'll just... work on my short game.
Yeah. [Pam puts her hand out for an earbud] Definitely.
OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.
I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.
Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.
Come on, Gabe, you can���t handle his hamstrings. You���re getting hypno-thigh-zed.
I'm pretty excited about today. I baby-sit Toby's daughter Sasha sometimes. So, she's the coolest kid. She has seen me play with dolls, though, so I don't know how cool she thinks I am.
Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?
Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker.  And a great number two for the office.
If I didn���t do certain things without telling Pam, she���d be married to Roy. [chuckles]
Hey it's me. So uh, don't worry. Everything's ok.
Nope, not a prank. I think it���s time for you to bury the hatchet.
Nnnno.  Uh, turns out, it was just a really bad idea involving fire.  But I think I fixed it.
You know what?  Maybe it's in the ceiling.
Doesn't matter what the name is. Se��or Loadenstein, that's stupid.
[Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.
Yep.  Yeah.  She's blind, is that a problem?
I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?
Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..
Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
No, no, no, definitely, definitely.  Yes.  Next weekend, then.  All right!  I love you, too.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what the best play is. Do we tear everything up, or do we buy a horse on the Internet? I mean, I don't know what to do. What do you think?
If this job is in a well, I don't want it.
So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.
Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who���s excited?
Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?
I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- [hears door, hides]
For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.
I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but it's always buried behind like a ton of black licorice? [points to pile of candy] Bought it all. Now it's like red city in there. So, enjoy it.
[to Karen] Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. [Karen steps into lake] Yes!
Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it.  We'll figure it out.  We'll be okay.
Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
Not enough? I don���t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it���s against the rules but I���m gonna need a favor from you guys.
You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
Oh, I didn���t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.
No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done.
Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about...
[as he and Pam flip their cards] John Stamos.
I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.
OK, here we go... Digest of business terms, CliffsNotes on business economics, and a sales encyclopedia.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork.
Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.
Who wants Phyllis as Santa? [most everyone raises their hand]
Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.
[Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop.
OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?
OK, I'm gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael's office] to do some work. So I will be in here.
She looks at it when she���s on the potty, and she makes the faces.
All right, I am connecting and ... you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this:  Go to applications--
Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs]
So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?
[Walks back into The Office] Yep, I did say that.
I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!
We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man.
Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...
Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?
This, man. I can���t do this to Pam.
We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
You know what?  Let's go.  We got to go to the hospital.
Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?
Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...
Oh by the way how's your side project going?
You should actually thank Erin, she's the one who agreed to babysit.
[pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
Oh, come on, Pete! God, that���s just sad. If he doesn���t watch himself, he���s gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.
Tony the tiger.  You don't hear that much any more.
Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. [Andy hums Six Flag ad] Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?
Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.
OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.
It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.
The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was...[car alarm blaring] was in the...
[holds up the retrieved lead] It involves you too.
Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.
Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.
But you know I wouldn���t hire any of these all-stars.
I am not kidding. [shows camera an engagement ring] Got it a week after we started dating.
Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.
Well we all want a good party, right?
I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.
Can I just talk to you for a second?
Dwight, I uh, I have something to confess.
Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.
[watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They've been in there for 45 minutes.
We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together.
Today.  Now, maybe.  'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.
Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.
OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.
[office phone rings at Jim's desk] This is Dwight.
I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope]
The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.
Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away]
Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.
[Michael, Dwight, Andy and now Pam are in the circle and training their 'weapons' on each other, Jim walks in]  Really?
Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]
Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- [texting on his phone]
Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?
No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.
Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.
I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.
Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?
Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!
Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.
Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...
You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley's face]
Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it.
There.  Now we're even.  [Pam laughs and mimes taking a picture, they kiss]
No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.
Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. [Jim puts a pencil into the time clock and pulls it out broken in half] We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
Oh, did the press ask for a story?
Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up.
I didn't think you'd notice. [laughs nervously] Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him.
Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.
Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.
I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?
Love you too. [hangs up phone, Pam sits on a bench crying]
[Sighs] I'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes.
He's not a part of this. You know that.
There���s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor ���
What the heck? Is that, uh... [bends down, cuts phone cords with scissors]
So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so...
Well... that's not gonna hold up in court.
I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?
Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?
And then you go to school for three years.
No. Okay. Um, I���ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.
I'm sorry. This is for a news audition?
Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away.
When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. ��I just wanted... to go home. ��This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013. ��You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space.
At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.
You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I���m gone.
How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.
[overlapping with Pam] Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed.
Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
That is good. That's it. That's what it is.
Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?
Is this a bad time to be doing this?
Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?
Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?
I think that's probably all we need to hear from...
Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types]
Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?
What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? [Pam laughs] Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.
I don't know about Stephen King, I mean...
Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?
Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way?
Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that���s only gonna make things worse.
Yep.  No, I mean I really liked it.  I thought was uh, a fun read.
Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?
Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.
Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?
Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry.
Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
But what are you gonna do about that?
Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight...
They weren���t really talking that much about money. They just said, We���re good with investing and then I...and I...
No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...
Office romances. Um... [laughs] I think you should probably ask Pam 'cause she's in an office romance, technically.
[walking to his car] Hey, it's me.  It is 5:03.
Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.
Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like.
Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim. [shakes head] I got nothin'.
Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? ���Guten Prank��� number one.
[sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome.
Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her.
No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal.
Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.
[watching baseball game on TV] Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out.
This is hilarious, but we���re gonna stop with all--
But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.
How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.
[time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?
Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?
There���s a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.
Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.
Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?
[Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What���s up?
Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?
Yeah, definitely didn't need help with that, but, yeah.
Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it.
Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good.
Careful...  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
Are you serious? [starts typing on the computer and Andy begins to lean in toward the computer]
This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -
[mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?
You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.
No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.
I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.
Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that it's Friday.  And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.
Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.
Good night, Dwight. [Jim leaves, Dwight continues crying]
[as Andy and Kevin shout 'yeah!' in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.
Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be...  Can we get a late checkout?  I don't...  I don't think she heard me.
So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?
Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward.
Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
Well, you know you can't actually poison him.
No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.
Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.
Oh, one hundred percent.  We all want to see you tattoo your ass.
How far away did you think we were?
Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.
You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?
[Pam approaches as he sits in his car]  Hey.
I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.
Yeah, I didn't think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.
Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?
[hushed voice] Uh yeah. Trust me, I���d rather be with you guys.
[interrupting] Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right? [tosses black licorice into trash]
Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work.
Hey it���s Jim Halpert.  I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight.  Because I���ve read a lot about this really great documentary.
Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?
I���m sure you did not. What was your question?
Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.
Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.
[in unison] I do not think that is funny.
Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.
No. I just missed my wife.[Gives Pam a hug and a kiss]
Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.
Well I���ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn���t believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.
Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.
Okay. All right, come on. [picks up Cece from Pam, whispers to her] Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip.
Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?
���Gotta go! Darth Vader's launching a huge attack.���
[points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.
And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.
You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also? [Pam nods] Yes we will be doing that. We'll be getting a dozen.
I had plans to meet a friend tonight.  Which I had to cancel.  But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer.
Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.
Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.
I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.
Pam, I couldn���t get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.
[in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff.
This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.
I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in --
I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill.
Oh Dwight, Dwight, [Dwight pukes on his back windshield]  Ohhhhhh!
That might be a little difficult with the one computer.
Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe.
He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash.
Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?
Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.
Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.
I'm sorry, wait, so is the question 'How'd I get to be so awesome?' [laughs] Because, I don't have an answer for you. [laughs]
[seeing Cece gone from the couch he left her] Uh, MeeMaw, where's Cece?
I got this. [taking Katy's bag from Michael]
New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door���
No, see? Right there, that���s the problem with your method. ���Cause I still don���t know if you���re saying ���Sea World��� or ���see the world,��� and it���s taking a lot of time to explain it.
Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys. [to Pam, under his breath] Can I have your sunglasses?
Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. [Pam nods reluctantly]  And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date.
Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...
What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.
Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.
OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.
Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.
Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.
Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. [To Pam] Hey! How are you?
Listen, this isn't a favor, all right?  This is a good idea. We all win.
[motions for her to follow him] Come on.
That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.
That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80's movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I don't do that, I think I'll be alright.
OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.
[sarcastically] Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started. [starts to write on a piece of paper]
Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?
[aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever.
Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
Does it save time though? ���Cause we���ve been here for about an hour.
Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I���m not looking south, I���m not livin���.  That���s what I always say.
[flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?
Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  I'll talk to them.
Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, ' You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.'
Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.
[touches headset] Call you right back. What were you saying?
Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic.
Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um��� I don���t know how to tell you this, but��� we have a little bit of a problem.
Yeah, right. I mean, unless they���re willing to pass some tests.
It���s just a list of our names, split into two columns.
Oh no, I didn't want to see you.  Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, I'd say it was equal.  So, good to see you...
My name is Jim Halpert and I am a sales rep, which is a very important job. Um, without me dozens literally dozens of small businesses would go paperless.  They would have to write on their hands, or bed sheets, or who knows you know. Total chaos, total chaos. I mean or they could get their paper somewhere else. Staples maybe. I don't know.
You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?
[leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen]
I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--
[turning around to Karen] Wait, are we playing teams?
I really don't know how it happened, David.
[peering nervously through conference room window] Oh, I don't have anything to say. I'm just hiding from Dwight.
It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.
So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.
Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, [starts snapping] you're a Jet all the way, right?
[dictating to Pam] Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
Okay, what was this look? [Oscar does the look.]
[after Darryl eyes him drinking from a thermos] It's mine. Don't worry.
The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.
[shoe falls while climbing ladder] Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. [grunts] Creed. I was never here, all right?
Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.
And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
Okay, you know what?  I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  He'd probably know...
That���s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
The one I have. I'll use the one I have.
That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it's a murder.
I really think we should join forces on this one.
And I found out that there's a bus at 5:00 a.m.
Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...
Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.
Michael, can I talk to you in your office?
There���s actually not a rule that says that.
Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. God, it's freezing, I gotta go in. You stay though for like five minutes.
No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?
Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea.  Let's go out.
Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?
What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?
[speaking into the mallard and looking a Dwight] Hi buddy.
Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
Why don't we head in your office to talk?
Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.
Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.
We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.
Ow, What are you doing? [Jim fights back]
I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.
Is that really how you want to get this job?
Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.
Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.
[laughs] I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um... [nods]
Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
[reading text] Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.
[shakes Michael's hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
[Michael walks in] Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets.  Do you want to-
[Jim and Dwight sitting next to each other in talking head interview] Go ahead.
And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?
Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
Maybe we should just wait and find out.
And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.
Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who���s gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.
It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.
I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.
I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.
Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don't worry about it.
All right, well it already went through, so...
I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah.
Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.
That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.
Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]
I just���really wish there was something I could do. [looks off]
So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight
Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more.
Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six.
Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.
That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.
Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...
I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.
The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational. I mean, he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year. Which is probably why this branch will be downsized.
The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.
You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.
Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?
[on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.
[Creed takes toy from toy drive box.] Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy
Okay. I���ll see you in a little bit.
Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing.
Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.
No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please.
I was just... I'm in love with you.
Hey! [Runs after her and looks into her eyes] I... [hugs her tightly, Pam doesn't hug back]
OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?
Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish?
We���ll see. You are an assistant who���s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.
At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision.
It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!
Wow.  I guess word got around.  That's a nice... honor.
The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. I'm gonna find him.
[as Pam has another contraction]  Oh!  Oh, alright.  That's a good one.
A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?
Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.
When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?
Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now.
Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.
No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten.  Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing.
How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.
When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?
No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.
Sorry it didn't work out. Hope you find what you're looking for.
You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I���m here.
Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.
Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.
Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.
Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.
As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.
Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...
Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.
That's actually a good idea.  We'll all take a brief intermission. [To Pam]  Hey, are you hungry?
What? [Karen's player shoots Jim's player, 'You killed Jim Halpert' appears on the screen, Karen giggles]
Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.
A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.
Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
[after 'the kiss'] You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.
[snaps back] No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand. [half of office raises hand] Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand. [other half of office raises hand]
Well, yeah I don't want to see her get physically harmed, that's for sure.
[on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.
Eh, she's nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.
[whispering to Pam in corner of room] So, they know.
Are you really gonna marry him?  [Pam nods] ...Ok.
So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
Yeah. [Shot shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse]
Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?
I���m talking to him this afternoon, but don���t get your hopes up.
Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam.  Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
[to babysitter] So... how do you guys know each other?
But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.
I���m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You���ve got a regional manager.
[laughs] Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or...
Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
[Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]
Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it.
I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video.  I knew we'd need a back-up plan.  The boat was actually Plan C.  The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago.  Pretty much the day I met her.
Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.
It's still happening right now actually, so uh...
Alright. Let's clear this up. [on phone] Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?
You see that?  I'm pretty sure she's...  Hi.
Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.
But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.
Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We're going to the hospital now.
Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?
It's Mose. Who do you think it is?
Andy, it's the last day of the quarter. We've already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.
So this is my life.  Until I win the lottery [laughs].  Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?
You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.
The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California��� for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.�� He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don���t really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.���� And he chose���
[In the parking lot, holding his side, walking to the taxi, Pam follows] Oh...what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. [To taxi driver] One second. Oh...
I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.
Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.
No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.
Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
[glances at Pam] Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.
I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa.
Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation?
We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It���s like everything I did, he just wouldn���t go for it.
Okay, 'A,' Halbert. And, 'B,' I think a more appropriate statement would be, 'The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests.'
Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage...
[to Dwight] All right. So... I guess this is it.
You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine.
So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.
Do you need us for any of this?
Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?
Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
[Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell?
Dwight and I are both writing letters to our clients. I'm just sending a quick note to say how much I appreciate their business, and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation. It's just... different styles.
I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again.
Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.
Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?
Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs.
I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand]  Just the guys.  Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem.  I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.
Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.
Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God.
I think I got a pretty good sense of that one.
[to the buyer] Hold on a second. [to Pam] The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about���
Toby and I used to sit together until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much.
Ah.  That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them.
No, it's not, because you don't really work here.
You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?
What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
A toast, better make it good.  To avoiding a class two felony charge.
Psst. You think this thing's gonna go much longer?
We gotta get someone else in there right now.
[Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.
Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.
[after Pam checks her cell phone] What's going on?
We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.
Ok, so promise that you'll wait till we leave the parking lot before you go to the bar.
Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.
Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind.
I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I���m helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I���ve ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong.
Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.
[overhears loud monster noises] Its Monster dot com.  Singular.
Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
Right! [Jim laughs as he answers the phone] Hey, what's up? Everything ok?
I mean, it's just that- [clears throat] You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you...
Yeah. It���s real. It���s the only way you���ll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She���s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
I���m really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?
Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. [hangs up phone]
To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?
We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.
Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.
And I don't support her choice to hit you.
No, let's let her rest.  I'm sure there's still twelve on each.
Well, it could happen. Have you ever seen the movie Outbreak?
I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it.[Pam laughs] OK, good luck!
I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes.  Tadah!
The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that���s final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I���m not risking that again.
Okay. There���s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.
You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.
Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?
He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things.
Hey. [Andy pushes things aside and sits on top of Jim���s desk, kicking things in the process.]
Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
What? [looks in box] Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?
How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran.
Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first.
But if not, there's always the army. The infantry.
Look, Pam, I don���t know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It���s gone. That moment���s just gone. I missed it.
[stammers] I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.
This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, 'just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.'
Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair.
You know, it's getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.
Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.
Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.
I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.
Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?
Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?
I think it'll take you a little longer than that.
[holding up a sign that reads, 'Dwight picked the wrong day to put a wooden mallard in my office']
[on phone] Hey, Brenda.  This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat.  And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right?  Um, so gimme a call back.  You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one.  Yikes.  Uh... give me a call back, I hope.  I'll talk to you later. Bye.
You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.
I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy.
Okay, it���s not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.
I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...
So beautiful. [Pam's starts to cry.  Jim pulls up chair to sit next to her] Hey--
He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.
Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.
Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people...
[grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second?
Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just��� we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.
Ah, let's do it. [laughs] Oh, that's healthy.
I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.
So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
It's not.  It's different.  But it's a good book.
All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.
[holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe.
[holds mug next to Andy's head] Make the face. [Andy smiles] Yeah, I don't see it.
Does the Department of Health know about this?
I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.
The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes!
Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don't know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.
I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
These are actually forks and knives from the break room.
[laughs] You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office]
Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.
And you went to New York to do this.  So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?
Michael, we only told our parents last week.
You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.
Andy, we're gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.
OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.
I don't know what else we can do here.
But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.
Ok. Well, hey, you're not here. You don't know, Ok? It's intense. They made me eat black licorice.
If anyone can do this, you can do this.
Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?
Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.
The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he���s gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it���s not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It���s strange.
Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?
Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.
[On the phone with Dwight] Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.
Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?
And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.
So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
[on phone]: Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ...
Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
[slinking out of the room] Alright, you are welcome.  I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.
All right, what the heck? Let's do it.
Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.
[pops back into Jo's doorway] Thanks again by the way.
It���s Ryan. ���I���m sorry. I lied. I���m not in the bathroom. I can���t do it. I need to see my mom. I���m going home.���
Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.
Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.
[whistling, places cup of coffee onto Dwight's desk] Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do.
I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.
Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.
Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --
[on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.
Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
Dwight. Dwight. [Dwight's car comes screeching into view]
Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.
[reading screenplay] Bullets are flying everywhere.  Ooo, wait, last page, big finish.  Here we go. Agent Michael Scarn kicks open the plane door with a karate chop.
You know, it's weird.  It's practically a shot for shot remake.
Co-managing is a give and take.  You have to pick your battles.  One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them.  He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.
Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.
I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. [behind Jim, Dwight climbs telephone pole] Oh he'll be fine. I made it up there.
[walks quickly to break room, opens cabinet and finds mugs of Oscar, Creed and Phyllis]
Oh, great. [reads] 'Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy.' Oh that's not good.
Oh, [clearing throat, deeper voice] Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh...
[to Pam] Are you cool to just hang out?
You good?  I'm just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...
You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!
Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--
OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes���and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that���s���an amazing gift.
Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.
Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.
Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. [starts walking away]
Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal. [in voiceover] I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.
Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
The big gun thing. [Dwight grabs at phone] Stop!
Ah, well I think I'm gonna see Katy.
Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.
I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] ...no.
Okay, that is a 'no' on the on the West Side Market.
I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.
Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try.
[cell phone rings] Excuse me, one second. Hi.
Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly?
No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.
I've always gotten along well with Toby.  Uh, we're friends.  But I don't think we'll stay in touch necessarily.  I think I'll probably get updates on him from Pam.
Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?
Story's kinda bland.  It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?
I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.
Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.
You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
And I have started a business in Philadelphia. [Pam shrugs]
Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.
Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5:00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes.
[crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
Ahem. This is for you... and [puts blanket around her shoulders] ...Happy Birthday, Kel.
I just didn't, you know, want a deal.
You did not have sex with Pam's mom.
Yes, it is harassment and I'm going to be suing the winking face. I've hired the angry face as my lawyer and you will be hearing from him pretty soon.
I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.
Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.
[talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?
[collects Dwight's weapons from around the office; holds up a hand scythe]
[demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.
Alright, here we go!  You're doing great!  She'll be here soon.
Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, it's totally hypothetical.
[to Eric] You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.
Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.
Oh! That was really. [Dwight hits purse against table] This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.
Okay. The annex it is. I���ll be sitting at your desk if that���s okay with you.
Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted.
Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.
[Overlapping] When's the last time you upgraded your printer?
Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?
I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.
[Pam starts nodding in agreement] Why are you nodding?
Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.
Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?
It's not even real yet. And I'm not gonna tell her 'til it's real.
I'm not writing, 'Horse Hunt.' I don't even know what that means.
Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.
Not really a question. [starts to laugh] Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk.
[long pause and then he sighs and nods] Yes.
Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah.
Well, then I guess you���re ready for this. [gives her the Christmas card]
So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.
Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?
I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok?
All right. Now I think it's time for you to go.
Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
Michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative.  Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I've ever known.  Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before.
I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it.
So, where did you learn how to play?
Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along.
But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon.
I don���t know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I���ve been faced with a tough decision, there���s only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.
Is it me, or are we just a little off today?
Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out?
Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela.
Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. [laughs] Oh, text message from my brother. 'Pam cool. Welcome to the family.'
Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night.  So...
Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
And, also, any forms that you are going to need...
Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.
Have you ever seen 'em do that? [walk outside and the parking lot is covered with snowmen]
Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second...
Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.
Yeah. Yeah. It���s a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to...
Uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'Cause otherwise we can't do any work.
Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?
Go bag's in the car...  Keys, my keys, where's my keys?
Hey uh, Michael.  Don't jump on the bouncy castle.  You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured.
So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.
I am gonna need your advice [starts playing loud opera music, everyone can hear it, Creed starts crying] I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think?
One more.  Why are you talking like that?
Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to 'Happy Birthday.' And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.
Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?
Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now. [crumples up beans, stomps on them, and throws them in a box]
So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...
Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.
No, that was his wife, so he's on his way.
Oh good, so we don't have to work.
[blows a raspberry, Erin looks shocked, Kevin chuckles]
- two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.
Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults.
Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.
Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
That���s pretty good.  What about uh, for a thousand points?
No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five]
Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham! [mimes punch] Gotta go through me first.
Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?
All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this.
You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if he's, see if he's back.
What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing.
Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.
No, I did that before, it added nothing.
And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear.
It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming.  But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel.  I just can't grab onto him.  It's infuriating.
And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.
Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, 'Mom, there's a ghost in my closet.' Now, you say one of two things - one, 'You're just having a bad dream,' or two, 'Let's go see what it was.'
Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.
We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on.
Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.
[on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big.
[to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay. [runs]
Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]
Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.
Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.
Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?
[hovering over Meredith's desk] Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.
Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.
Oh, don���t look at me cause I think you���re making a terrible choice.
I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.
You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.
Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?
If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.
Well, I should hope so. [Michael takes phone] Who is this?
Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.
I would love to hear the other mottos.
And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.
I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people.
So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?
Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right?
I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
This... is the future, because... This is the past. I���ve been through a lot of issues in my life. I���ve seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I���ve been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause]
How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too.
[sighs] Hey David, how would you like a guy who���s not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?
[tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no.
Ok, um, this is��� [leaves DVD with her]���I���ll be right back.
So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.
You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.
It's still on a bike path though right?
Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!
Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.
Okay, I'll just go get the other guy.
Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
Well it���s not that easy. It���s kind of sometimes difficult.
Ok, so that's a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. It's pretty smart, right? [walks into Vance Refrigeration office] Hi, how you doing? I'm Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.
[Meredith's hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh!
So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
[whispering] Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable.
The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
So, as it turns out, Dwight is right. How bizarre.
Well... yes, that's probably what it is.  So what do I do?
[hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done.
[ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?
I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it]
But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.
[Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.
[on the phone]and I���m back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?
[presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]
No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.
See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.  It's-
OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...
[to Pam] ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good.
Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?
Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.
Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.
No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.
Oh, hello Mater. Good news: I've married. Tell Fater. [hangs up] Such a nice woman.
Sorry, man, I can���t focus on zingers. There���s too many potential clients.
Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--
Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you���re not the best with the phone.
My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with.'
Have you asked her what she wants to do?
Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here.
Got it.  They're like the penguins of the airplane family.
Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?
Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into?
[on phone] Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. [to office co-workers] Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out. [lowers voice] He said it should just be under an hour, so... [everyone groans] we did it.
Well, I think you handled it pretty well.
I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
It's true. I'm having a party.  I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up.  [sighs]  He is very real.
Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?
But there is a reason why I'm here!
Yes, he did.  You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.
Chapter 9 ��� The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?
Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally.
Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman.
That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.
We don���t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-
No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so...
That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right?
Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?
Don���t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.
Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
What award would you like to give Dwight?
Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?
What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?
Doesn���t seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.
You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?
Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or...
I need you to breathe in my face right now.
It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.
[Jim and Pam are walking outside] I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.
[walks into his office and sees the mallard back on his desk] Dwight, you brought the mallard back.
[Michael give Jim a 'World's Best Boss' mug] Thank you.
[scoffs] I... will never say a word.  And now, we are even.
Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything.
You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.
[while Dwight and Kelly are arguing] Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one.
[sighs] I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.
What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.
Wasn't it...  It's kinda like a...  Like that.
Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.
I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
Hey! Can I talk you? For a second?
And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.
Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.
Karen and I are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time. I don't know what to tell you. Right now? Dead heat.
Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -
There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.
Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes.
No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!
[at company picnic] All right, you ready for this?
[on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.
[seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. 'Soo-ven-yay.' Mr. 'Jacques Soo-ven-yay.' Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.
[coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks.
Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.
19. [grunts] I had a really hard work out this morning.
It's a killer new dance move. [re-enacts leaning back] Do you wanna talk in your office?
Ah, ah, ah. Where's the 'please'? We're not animals.
No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular.
Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
Toby? Mm hmm. [looks back to Michael] I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...
[on phone] All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. [hangs up the phone and rubs his eyes] Whoo! [Erin jumps in the background]
Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.
Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.
I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
Getting my wife a week off from work.
So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.
Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.
Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?
Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen.
Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned.
Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this.
If your client likes Italian food, you bring him to Cugino's.  And if your client likes a little action, you bring him a gambler.  And if your client hates Cornell, you bring him Andy.
Shut up, you, shut up!  This is the dumbest thing we've ever done.
I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
[using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight]
[ahem] You can... [slightly effeminate] You can do it Ryan.
Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises.
I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy.  But I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  [reading from various books]  Five to seven minutes.  Five to seven minutes.  Six minutes.  Different, but not really.  Five to seven minutes.
Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.
Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.
Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit...
Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.
Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.
Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously.
Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight���s night, okay?
I think you're good.  Doing a good job.
Ah, gotcha.  Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.
Thank you. You know what, screw this! [pulls Pam into a big smooch]
So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I'm saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn't he?
What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life.
Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here.
No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you!
What? Yes, that is exactly what I mean. Wow. You are very good at what you do.
Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on.
Well, if Pam says she won���t go, then���[chuckles] we���re gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph.
Oh, it���s the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela���s been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.
I'm Jim. [Jim hi-fives Abby] Annnnd... let's sell some paper.
Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people.
Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
[motions he is on the phone] Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. [comes over] Okay. [sees notebook with two lists of staff names] What is this?
We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?
I like the wild card.  I'm already liking the wild card.
Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?
Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.
Andy ��� this whole idea of our situation being just like war?  It���s just not true.  We just work at a paper company.  And you���re our regional manager.  And guess what man?  You don���t have to prove anything.  We like you as regional manager.  Andy if you don���t believe me take a look at what���s on my head.  I���m wearing a very pink hat.  I���ve been getting weird looks all day because I���m pretty sure ���DM does GB��� means something kinda sexual.  But guess who���s wearing them?  All of us.  Just for you man.  That���s huge.
I bet I should. [takes cell phone photo] That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you.
Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.
What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone.
What I���m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I���ve ever said.
But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.
Quick question - do you play the guitar?
You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
[to camera] Who is this guy? We are killing it.
Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy.  Thank you.
Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--
Hey guys let���s just all admit it. Ok? Dwight���s better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he���s never, ever going to go back on it right?
But it���s Dwight who���s bring in all the weirdos.
All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
We were... I think she was just trying to-
Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.
Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know.
Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.
Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires.
Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything?
We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just - [blows air] - all in.
OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.
Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing]
Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird.
But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh.
All depends on the conference room meeting itself. [phone chimes] Uh, okay.
No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.
Okay, here's uh, this is very simple. 'Dwight's Workspace,' nice.
Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.
What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing.
Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.
You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.
[Jim moves his head closer and Pam taps him gently in the face] Oh, ok.
Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]
If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --
If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, 'Well that's pretty premature to think,' but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.
Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?
Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think...
Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.
Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky.
No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think.
By the way, they do need an extra day next week.
Michael, look I'll just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.
Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?
Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.
Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.
Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?
What? What am I gonna do? I don���t ���
OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later. [hangs up]  That was a good story.
Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.
Dwight. This, [picks up balloon] fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?
You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.
I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody.
Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.
You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.
Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.
Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
Hello? [laughs] No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK. [punches button on phone]
I'm sorry.  She scares me. [walks away, Pam keeps eating]
Is this real? [Pam dumps Michael's screenplay on Jim's desk]
Um, like stapler tennis or something like that.
That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag...[looks up to ceiling where there is a red tape X over Dwight's chair] Oh my god.
You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.
Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.
Wow, can we make it a different moment?
Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  I'm glad.  Any real potential there Beesley?
Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo���s here. Let���s do this. Change if you need to.
Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.
Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]
[wearing a tuxedo] I don't know. Is it classy enough?
Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.
I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? [pause] I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.
Now, wait a minute.  You're not gonna punch a wall, or me, or anything like that if you don't win the point, are you?
Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.
Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.
[brings Michael into his office] So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?
[to camera] Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?
I don���t know how else to tell you.
Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.
[goofy voice] Frank and Beans. [laughs] Always makes her laugh.
Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!
Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.
I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.
I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it���s good for the environment too.
Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone.
Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.
You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager.
Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.
You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.
Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. [Michael and Dwight enter] Guys?
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by]
OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.
Thank you for all of this. This is so helpful. You know what? One last question. Um, who is that fine older gentleman in the corner? [points to Creed]
Let's be honest, it's not totally my fault. [indicates Pam]  Shared responsibility.
Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
I've had a Foreman grill for about six years, I've done about 85% of my cooking on it, but I've never burnt myself, probably because I don't use it as a pillow.
Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don't. Riveting.
OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.
No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.
You know, I just think you should know that-
Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?
No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You're way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.
I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
[laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn't do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. [looks at camera] You know what, just come here.
Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work.
You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.
How do you hate it? It's a cake.
I'm gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids.
Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.
Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings.  Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.
Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.
You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
[A note is on Jim's computer that says, 'It is time. Parking lot at noon.' Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]
Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
I don't really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.
Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.
Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.
Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.
Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.
I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.
No way. I think she likes this stuff.
Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker.
Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again. [Pam rolls her eyes and walks away]
Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.
Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica.
Ok, he didn't fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.
[Carol walks through door looking upset] [waves] Carol.
You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine.
Like hypothetically��� if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.
Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.
I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.
[grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.
Um, you know what, I actually didn���t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.
Three, two, one! [pulls sheet to reveal Christmas tree]
[on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.
Well, I can't be the only one who didn't -- [sees mugs on Angela's and Meredith's desks]
Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it.
Hey, Phyllis, Do you have any games that you play in the office?
Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?
That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.
Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion.
What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!
[approaches Roy back at the wedding] There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?
[entire office is chatting] I'm saying, all I'm saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying.
You���re not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I���m in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You���ve agreed to this.
David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.
No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.
That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?
I can't believe you guys.  I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
Nice.  That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.
I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day.  So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna.  ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name.
Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit.
[Jim slams lunchbag on table] I just totally blew a sales call.
Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'.
Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?
[naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?
Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad.
[raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?
In the box. [hits it straight into the floor]
No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not...
Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.
Okay alright. [gets up] I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.
All right. ��Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues]
Closed. [Michael leaves his office, gives Jim two thumbs up, which Jim returns]
That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. [Jim sees Roy and trails off]
Oh, also, while you���re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.
Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.
No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?
So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?
[looks bored. Taps finger on desk. Head falls to desk]
No, it- [high-pitched feedback as Jim starts to leave, feedback changes as he moves, turns over the mallard to see the listening devics, sighs, places mallard back on the desk]
I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves.
Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I'm gonna need four. [kisses Pam]
Hypothetically. Hypothetically you were making out in the woods.
I don't know though. I mean, you know that was a hit.
Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, let's go to the hospital.  Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.
You���re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty.
[ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what?
I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here.
You know, at the end of the day, it���s really only two days. I mean, I���ll be back in the office. ��If you need me for an emergency, call me. ��I���ll be there...
cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or...
Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.
Is Ryan gonna fire me?  I don't know.  I know that I've done everything I can, and I just brought in a huge sale, and... am I insane, or was this kid a temp two years ago?  Because in the three years that he's been here, I think all he's ever done is start a fire and grow a beard.  And it's not even a good beard.
Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close?
Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
Yeah. You know what? I���ll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.
With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number.
Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.
Nah, I think it's mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.
[sits down next to Denise] So, high school.
And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green.'
Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again?
Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?
Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.
You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.
Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head:  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.
Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.
And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.
Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause. [group agrees, protests]
I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.
And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD.
Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk.
I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?
Are you not gonna put out the torches?
Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.
[dancing with Pam. They kiss] See, now you don���t owe me anything.
But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.
Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.
You know, truth be told, I think all you���ll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I���m gone.
No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.
Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.
By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?
In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment.
I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
You are really good at modesty. She���s a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kids��� room. There���s a hippo leading a parade of 500 children���
Pam!  You don't think he'll mind if we take the shampoo, do you? [holds up large bottle]
Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.
It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven.
Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?
A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?
Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?
Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.
Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]
If it's the same thing, then why did you write 'workspace'?
-I just don't know if I can do it.
Chapter 4 ��� One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-
You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.
[he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!
I just don't know if he's presidential enough.
I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That���s it. You look really, really good.
Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.
No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.
Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.
Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. [Windows reboot sound] Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?
We bonded. We got to- [Dwight starts dropping into the bus on top of Jim]
This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I'm not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley's tie is really the story of the day...
Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?
Call me when you get in. [kisses Pam]
We'll see.  I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.
Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]
You pet the animals and they pet you back.
Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. [Reveal Jim behind Quad-Desk] Thank you.
So what did he say? Was it my fault?
Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.
Well it's just that you had no hair on Friday.
Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now?
Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
[trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.
How much time do you have left on your break?
No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.
You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.
OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. [Everyone talking Phyllis pours Jim some eggnog, as Daryl walks in] Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?
I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one.
[pumps fist] ...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.
Pam and I are good buddies.  I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.
You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?
I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name.
Ah...[sees Dwight's wallet and open email] I'm gonna s- [see's Dwight watching from break room]
I'm just killing Germans, any way I can.
And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor?  Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages?  That'd be great.
[inspecting the hole in the wall] Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall.
[to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.
[Michael playing air guitar on pool table] Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this.
Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn.
That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.
Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.
[Opens folder and reads from Dwight's file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good.
Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go. [hands her an envelope with money in it]
I have no idea.  We went right for the copier.
I've spent so much of my life telling myself 'Please, don't end up like Stanley,' and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes.
But I think it���s big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea���.which, by the way, I can���t wait for.
[on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled?
Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...
OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me.
I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.
I don���t know, for such a crazy number I���d like something pretty crazy.
Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement.
Good. I like it. You know what. Pretend to smoke. [Dwight pretends to smoke]
OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday.
But that would make more sense. [Pam sighs]
Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?
[conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.
Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
Oh, man, I���d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that.
Really?  Do you wanna get back to that?  I could go.  I should go.
And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.
I'm gonna help you through it all right?
No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place.
Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?
We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.
If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.
All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.
Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.
Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.
Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-
Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's���I think she understands... what this is.
Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?
What is that? [looks at sign that says 'IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.'] It is your birthday period.
Take care of my wife. I will be back.
Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?
Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. [Pam laughs]
Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.
[picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.
Only if you tell me what you're writing.
Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.
I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?
Angela, it���s Halloween. You have to sing ���Monster Mash���.
Mmmhmm.  Why don't you start by telling me what you got.
This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that���s for fueling only. No savoring.
[as Dwight tries to take paper out from under him] Hey, can you not?
Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?
But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.
[on phone] Please don't pick up, please don't pick up, please don't pick up.
Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.
This is actually a big potential sale, so...
I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  He's winning.  I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.
No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.
Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children?
Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.
My friend's basement. All right, ready to start?
Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?
Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard.
[clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up]
Forget it. It's just a dry erase board.
No, he didn't. [Dwight mouthing 'yes, he did']
Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.
I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money.
[after entering daycare] Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.
And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]
[walks in, see's Oscar, Stanley, Creed and Kelly sitting in Michaels office] Okay, I thought I saw people missing.
Gettin��� a lot of mileage out of this, aren���t ya?
Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
In Philly, so, that doesn���t really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.
It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.
Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.
I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.
Okay. But what is he more famous for?
Now how do you know how it works?
Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
[enters] Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They���re going to make you pay for the fish, and��� they wanted to know when you can start.
I don���t even know where the stairs are!
Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days.  How's your summer?
I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]
Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy.
Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer]
Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
LOVE the hair. [Ryan walks up driveway with blonde dyed hair]
Andy, can I talk to you for a second?
I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?
Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman.
You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. [both laugh]
Then you did nothing wrong. We should go.
Wow, what do you put our chances at?
Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-... [Jim bites his lip]
Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands]
Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1:15.
Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
Um... let's see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king.
That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
Dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level. And he apparently has a girlfriend, so... I guess there really is someone for everybody.
What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
Oh, my God, thank you. [hugging both] Thank you.
[to Jordan] Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.
OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use [finds a mug] uh, oh -- Snoopy.
I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.
Hey, come on.  Let's go to the hospital.
Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna���
Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we���re scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix ��� me asking the boss of the company I���m abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash.  So��� problem solved. Thanks, guys.
Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.
To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.
Stanley. Uhh��� you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
No, you what, seriously, you should have it.
So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.
[Reading Pam's palm, while she has on extremely padded gloves] Wow, that is really interesting.
So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.
I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything. [laughs]
[quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.
Oh man, that's crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.
Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me
I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
[in the conference room] Hey Pam, can I see you for a second?  So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day.  So he generously offered to wash our car.
Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry.
Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight.
Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?
And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
You���re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh���
The next year he really stepped things up.
What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
I'm going home, and I'm taking my baby with me.
I don't know.  Feel like... Friday night crowds...
That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?
Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.
Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met...
OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. 'Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall.'
All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.
Right in the sweet spot. I think you���re gonna be really happy.
He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
Pam, I���m not explaining this to you-- Pam, I���m not going over this again.
This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.
[a text tone goes off] Is that my phone?
Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.
���Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you.���
[Michael is seen debating on whether to come back in to the office] Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?
Alright, let's get this started.  I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.
Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.
Yeah.  [Jim leans in for a kiss but Pam turns away]  She's fine.
That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
Hey, do you guys have any other games?
Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.
Well, maybe you should get back to work.
I promise you, we don���t need a warning-
This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?
How long is this? [flips through pages]  Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings.
Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...
[after tense pause] OK. Here ya go. [roughly hands Darryl his thermos]
[Pam storms out of the break room] Hey...
Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? [points at self] This guy!
You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.
Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
[hands Pam Andy's phone] Are there any messages?
Oh!  See I'm here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
You will never want to leave your room.
Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?
I feel like a stranger in my own country.
Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second.
[getting up quickly to silence Michael] No, no. Nope.
Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
I can't.  She's too strong.  She's, careful, though.  You don't want to break it.
The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... [shrugs] Oh well.
So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.
[Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom.
And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.
No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!
[Irish accent] Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us.  Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.
That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?
Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.
No, I mean, great detective work.  'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?
Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.
Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win.
There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.
Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul.
But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.
[on phone]  Hi, yeah.  This is Mike from the West Side Market.  Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah.  You have 'em in the warehouse.  Great.  What is my store number... six.  Wait, no.  I'll call you back. [quickly hangs up] Shut up [to Karen].
Do you really have to do that right now?
Prank! [throws money from Dwight���s wallet on the floor]
You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!
What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?
There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.
So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning.
You could���ve just called that an alliance too, right?
You know what? I could use a little help.
Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.
No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard.
No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I���m not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody.
[on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]
Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.
Get in the car? [Jim and Pam get in the back seat]
Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?
Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?
Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some fire crackers and they start popping]
So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.
No. I can't. It was like, hours ago.
Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work.
There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!
Dwight, you can���t just hire someone ���cause they���re your friend.
Yeah... .you want me to come in your office?  Oh.
So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.
You really think you can make it up to me with food?
God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]
Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else.
Oh. Adorable, right? [opens kiddie bathroom, sees man on toilet] I walked in on someone in the bathroom.
Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now.
Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.
My god, I���m so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.
That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...
���Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA��� Dash JH.
There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay?
What's that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don't, because I've got my eye on you.
Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?
Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.
Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.
Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?
[on the phone] Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs...
Do you know the industry is in decline?
Oh man, it was great. They were great.
And then an older gentleman asked you 'Boxers or briefs?'
You know what?  I'm just going to call a cab from here.
[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm excited.  Oh, definitely.
Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input���
Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?! [Kelly and Erin screaming as Dwight bashes their heads together, everyone attacking each other and yelling]
Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.
No way. Let's do this [crumples post it and throws into mug. Misses.] Oh.
It didn���t have a buster sign around him?  Why don���t you draw him?  Why don���t we see this whole thing.
Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.
Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. [pulls up Dwight's game] Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.
Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head]
[coughs] Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one!
Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert���s notebook.
No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap.
So, the plan was seven minutes.  But we're calling an audible, because that's her call.  Because she's the quarterback.  I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.
Well what if we can't do it quickly.
Okay, okay, it's no big deal.  So you're not a computer geek.
Yeah, no one can snap with their little finger.
Alright. [Jim's phone rings] Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?
Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance.
A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?
Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down.
Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies.'
Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!
Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office]
Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.
[trying to hide from Michael what they're doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]
If you want to come back then, that'll be fine.
She's wearing a onesie [holds out his cell phone, Oscar leans in but Kelly grabs his arm]
[not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [sic] energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  [David laughs] So that's a... bonus.
Well, Andy has a mug just like that.
Because it is Halloween. So if you���re going to sing a concert, it���s a good idea to throw that one in.
I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn���t know. Um��� actually I did tell Pam and we decided ���no���. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I���m thinking there���s another conversation coming. And, it���s hard to know when that will be.
He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.
No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]
Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.
All right, you know what? [picks Pam up and carries her off the court] Let's do this.
[Holds up Hooters t-shirt] Just you know politics, literature.
What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just...
Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical.
OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?
My charity is the Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's Department, because Dwight's a Volunteer Sheriff. So I thought this was a perfect opportunity to support/mock him.
Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don���t want to meet that person.
Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.
You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.
No. [Michael gets up and walks into his office]
All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
[waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?
Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. [Towards unseen cameraman] Is bold the right word?
How many words per minute does the average person type?
Okay, you could just show up late though.
[Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah...
Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you [in a more and more seductive voice] and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? [Kevin gets up to join the 'hot' team to their great joy] Does that end the debate?
Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?
So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.
You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.
I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...
So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright! [knocks on side of truck]
Oh wow.  So that���s two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?
Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?
Or a high school girl. Let's go [mouths 'wow' to the camera].
Guys, what is going on?!  [Pete and Tom burst out in laughter]
Okay now really think hard about this one:  One year.
Uh, what does -- what does that mean?
Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.
Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.
I may have told some people that.  I'm nervous.  I'm about to get married.
[walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?
No, nope. What else? What else? You watch The Hills? What is Heidi thinking?
It's, okay, it's Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.
Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to...
Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.
But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
Oh, Clark. I���m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.
What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?
...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
[In Kitchen] We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.
I saw the movie. I just don't know every line from the film.
[on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.
Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he���s gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--
Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.
Okay! First of all, stop using my name.  And second of all-
Ah, good. Good luck. Doing good. [goes to the index cards and writes another race down]
Oh, Pam? Can I see you in here for a second? It's important, so...
Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical.
I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.
Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.
No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is: really sorry.
[shakes Michael's hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them]
I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow���s his wedding day. You can���t be anything but happy on your wedding day.
Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading 'Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!']
Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing.
You know what you should do? Take a vacation.
Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?
[noticing that everyone is giving him a sympathetic look] How does everyone know already?
It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.
I'm not gonna- [cuts himself off, Kevin walks in]
Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...
I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.
I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?
I wouldn���t be too sure about that. Just saying.
[points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean?
Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
Not important.  Because you're not dating her.  Because it's a felony.
You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...
[in the stairwell on his phone] Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!
The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says 'You wanted me' enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.
He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.
It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or...
Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago.
Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I���this will be so huge for our family.
You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.
Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today?
And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.
Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch.
what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
Let's go driver! [clapping] Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...
Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter.
Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here...
No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.
Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.
So, I guess I'll see you in [looks at watch] ten hours.
Well, that is because that is the gift that keeps on giving. Oh, my God. I left today's paper on my desk.
OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...
Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so... [imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles, Michael comes over by Jim laughing]
Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.
[answers phone] Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.
All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... [to Dwight] what is this?
Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything.
Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?
Mose has been weird? That���s so unlike him.
I���m on the phone. I���m on the phone.
Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them.
Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don���t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
[on the phone]I can have it to you by the beginning of next week.  Alright? Thanks very much. [hangs up] Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?
Pam gets a little down.  Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago.
Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better.  I only slack off when things are good.
Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.
[on phone] Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a...
Try this. [takes Dwight's 'Asian' race and switches it with the one he wrote]
Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents...
You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it���s just gonna make you cry?
You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.
Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.
[attempting to move car seat] It's like The Hurt Locker!
Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.
[On the phone] Right, oh let me just check the pricing list.  Hold on one second...
Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.
So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.
No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.
Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.
Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
I'll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!
Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.
Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.
How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.
I promise you, you don���t have to do this for me.
[sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.
Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.
Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
[reads demerit] 'Jim Halpert, tardiness.' Ugh. I love it already.
[starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ...[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
I found Dwight's wallet in the parking lot.
Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in��� March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so��� [sits on floor]
Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...
I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that's not happening, I'm not averse to just buying them all off.
Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--
We should help him out. [Jim and Pam each take a French fry, eat it, and then look toward the bathroom]
Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?
I think they're going to the conference finals.
So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back.
We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.
Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!
Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.
[gets up to leave room, Michael gestures for him to stay]
Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.
I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...
Just then, Agent Chang gets a bullet in the head.
I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife���
Well, then why are you wasting everybody else's time interrogating them?
Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...
Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small-[pointing to Angela] Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!
Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away 'Survival Skills' and 'Self-defense.'
[after a pause] That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.
Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.
Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about? [Michael leaves]
When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?
[taking away Dwight���s handset] Go ahead David, I���m listening.
Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.
I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.
Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally]
Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?
She's, um, she's in New York. She's at an art school.
Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves]
We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.
I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh]
I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...
Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?
Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?
Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.
These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one.  [Michael stands on podium] Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal. [everyone claps]
Oh, okay. Oh, do... that's what the tape is for. I didn't know.
I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.
Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?
No, No, we'll just board that up.  It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.
Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?
How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go.
Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him.  And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.
Now, this is the projection over three months?
No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.
[Michael is wearing a wig that is very close to Jim's actual hair, and he is wearing fake earrings, and speaking in a punk-ish deep voice] I totally don't know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?
Let me guess, you think you should get it.
It���s from the teapot. Everything you���ll ever need to know is in that note. [Pam reads the card] Not enough for me? You are everything.
Oh my God!  Wait, this goes back two years.
I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So���my pitch is���me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.
Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?
Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.
I think today was a good day to have two managers.  'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing.  But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy.  It's because they're doing it for the kids.  And I get that now.
Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
[sitting on a stack of paper] Yeah, well, if you're only free till three on Sunday and I can't get there till one, then it's gonna be pretty tight.
Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?
Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.
That'd be great, thank you. [Erin throws package, it hits Kathy. She thinks it was Jim who threw it]
Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend.
No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-
But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.
I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks?
Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends.
[mimicking Stanley] I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
[snickers at Pam's sketch] That is pretty cool.
Thank you, sir. [Tips his glass to Daryl]
Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?
I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.
I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp...
[to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know.
And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat]
Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.
Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so...
Alright Pam, alright [gives her hi-five]. Nice work!
All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]
That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?
Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud.
How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.
Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry. [Pam looks at Jim] Sorry. I think I'm just hungry.
No, don't worry about it.  We'll just got double or nothin'.
Oh.  Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.
And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back.
Later, Kev. [Puts French Onion Potato Chips on Pam's desk] Have a good weekend.
I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, I'll just be in, you know. [closes door behind him to supply closet]
Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.
I really don't know.  How you doing with all this?
Okay. I can���t say that that���s not fair.
[looks in  the refrigerator] Hey Dwight, my tuna sandwich isn't in the refrigerator. You wouldn't know anything about that would you?
Come on man, just give it a couple days.  I think you'll be all right.
How embarrassing is it? That's not fair. Here...
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone.
Oh, I actually talked to my wife and we���d really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor.
[whispering] I don't even know who you are anymore.
[back to Pam] Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.
Well it���s sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
[starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn.  Four seconds.
Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.
Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?
Yeah, woah. [deeper voice] Yep, absolutely, go ahead.
Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?
[On phone in hallway] No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.
So, you used to share that cubicle with Kelly, right?
Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.
Hey, so this isn���t matching up with this���and I���m not sure which one���s right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?
I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!
Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column.
Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.
Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or...
Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.
Darryl, it doesn���t matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.
Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.
Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.
I didn't say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.
[using black voice] Good afternoon! [Darryl smacks his arm]
And that's why it's on my desk, Phyllis; it means a lot to me, and now that I know it was from you, it means even more.  Moving on!  Uh, ok, so that's the end of the tour for now, and if you liked it please tell your friends: 'Whenever you're in Scranton, visit Casa de la Halpert'.
That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.
No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it.  I'm told it started as a team building exercise.  Unfortunately I really suck at it.  We didn't play many video games in Scranton.  Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor.  And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus.
[whispering, going into the bathroom with Cece] Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!
[Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing, Jim imitates her] Can I do something for ya?
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.
Time. Space. Gender. [Dwight mouthing words] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] No, that���s --
To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle.
He has not stopped working for a second.  At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work.  It's exhausting, being this vigilant.  I'll probably have to go home early today.
[as Pam stares at him] I can feel you looking at me.
Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?
Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.
You���re not serious, are you? You didn���t get any of the recital?
Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out. [closes door]
Why's it smell real? [Pam shows him a hidden car-freshener] Ah... good one.
[on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.
That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
Okay. Let's start with the 'I love you' level.
[on the phone] Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.
Oh yeah, how long's this meeting going to last?  [Stanley mumbles, looking at his watch]
[waiting outside the bathroom for Pam, he is holding a hand-picked bouquet of flowers and pacing] These are for you.
Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.
Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.
I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.
Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.
[walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] 'Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.' [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!
Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didn't tell you that.
Cece���s ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I���ve been working with her on her move. It���s called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It���s kind of like this. It���s pretty cute, right?
Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all.
She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.
Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.
Yeah, you don't have to, ummm.  Alright, yes, that's not gonna be awkward at all.
[Jim and Pam approaching the wedding venue] Is this his house?
Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.
OK, I don���t have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we���re just starting couple���s counseling. Uh, which doesn���t sound any better.
We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.
No, you're not reopening the case.  The case is closed.
So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.
This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left.
Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?
Hey, you know what? I got you a cake.
Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, 'For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?' and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?
Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.
Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
I love you.  Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!
Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
This is way more than I make now.
You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.
[As he's walking out] That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!
Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.
Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this: umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. [reveals Dwight's purple belt]
You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.
Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
You cut more than you had to, didn't you?
[on phone] Absolutely.  I couldn't be more sorry about this.
I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.
Well, that is... because you didn't realize that... I was left-handed.
So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam.
[yawning] What about an energy drink or something?
Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.
[on the phone] Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great. [goes into a private room where Pam and the doctor are, the voices are inaudible, but the camera can see through a window, Pam and Jim look in shock, they hug and Jim goes back out into the hall to call Dwight back, trembling] Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs! [laughs] Ohh! [goes back into the room to hug Pam]
Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?
Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you���d ever set foot in in this town?
No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.
Okay, you know what?  You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.
I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me.
No, I didn't. [Michael laughs] You know why?
You know what, just in case she's looking you should put some stuff in it.
No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.
And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]
Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.  And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.  Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay.  I believe she thinks she saw it.
I have to.  Pam, if I'm not there, someone's going to go to jail.  Or die.
I mean, do you like it? You having fun? [Andy snorts, unsure how to answer] Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun���.and you did that.
Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.
[to Karen] Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole.
I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!
Don't. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!
Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
Okay, that's insanely complicated and the first thing I'm going to do is erase it.
Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.
We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.
It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.'
Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. True���[touches his nose] Oh no.
Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.
Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.
Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?
I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why.  Interesting.
So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume.  And a moustache.
Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer.
Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.
Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?
Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?
Good eye - it's an oval.  [Andy compares his arm length to his side of the conference table] You're measuring the table.
Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while.
Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.
Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?
He���s got a bank vault. That���s a start.
Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.
No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right.
Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.
Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.
Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool.
Sorry. I���no, no, no, what I meant���what I meant actually was���
[changes channel during commercial, sports scores appear on screen.]
I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.
[Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course
No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.
Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own
[on phone] I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
Oh, burn.  Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too. [they laugh]
It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-
Uh, can you get this rundown for me?' [impersonating Charles]
Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?
And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?
I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses.
Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?
You can't yell out 'I need this, I need this' as you pin down an employee on your lap!
Cool. Thanks. [puts his hat on Erin's head]
Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.
Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly.
No, it's not 'ugh.' It is... office camaraderie.
You���re gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy���s gonna record it. So we���ll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?
And I was still just a paper salesman.
Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write?
So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal.  It's Lackawanna County.  Our whole county.  And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch.  And I could work here for years.  And years.  [groan] Years.
Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working.
I liked you better when you were the temp.
Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?
Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?
Because you said 'do you wanna hang out'-
So what is going on, girl in the computer?
Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.
Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.
The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs]
Alright, well, we're never leaving the house again.
No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...
Well there is some bad news.  [accent] There has been another murder.
Hey, man. It���s halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don���t. I���m in. Yeah, yep, I���m all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. [hangs up] Yeah!
[telephone ringing] [shows note to camera 'It's OK. She'll call back!']
Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.
Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.
So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.
[in women's bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.
[sees a pole poking out Dwight���s pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight's wallet]
Yeah sorry everyone else didn���t come.  I think they���re just tired.  With holes in their shoes.  And they have dysentery.
Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
So I guess I can assume that was personal.
Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs]
She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that���s fine.
Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?
I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here: Michael handles more of the 'big-picture' stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...
I���m sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment.
It's Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that.
I haven���t heard of it, obviously. But I���m out because I am significantly younger than you-
[on phone] Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background]
I'll just leave that suit in your office then.
I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
That's weird, if it's not locked, why isn't it opening?
You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
All you're gonna need to [faking a bad connection] and-  it- and then go to--
I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball.  Oh, how much?
Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now.  Totally.
I���m doing this just for me? Is that what I���m doing? I���m doing it just for me. If that���s what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?
You making this up as you go along, aren't you?
Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot.
That's okay. [Hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby] Oh, no, it's not. I'm sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?
Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?
Here's the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because they're set up to do that kind of thing.
He's good at his job.  And I like working for him.
You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks.
Alright, then I will catch you later��� What do we do now?
I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really...
Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... [Ryan walks in]
This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
Are you sure you once knew how to do this?
Another round, boys? Great. [Jim walks to the bar]
Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.
I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.
Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do ���opportunities.���
I... why don't we go back to this animation.
I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.
All right, guys. It didn���t work out for any of us, so��� we���re still on the same team. Let me get these.
Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.
Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...
K, Kevin, are you saying ���See the world���? or ���Sea World?���
Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
Hey, uh, does Mr. Nortman still teach here? He's a jerk, right?
Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that.
No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this!
Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.
Yeah, who'd have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up; smiles]
Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?
[sounds of a car crash] What was that...
You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
OK.  You know what?  Here we go. [stands up] Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged.
[phone] Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.
I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.
It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.
All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.
All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player.
Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it.
Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.
And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says 'No, Jim, here's a way.'
Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
[opens door to Gabe's office] All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again. [Gabe motions that he's on the phone] 'Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.
I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.
You did not force me to do this.
It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.
He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?
Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can...
But that doesn���t matter. This does. It���s the only thing that matters. We���ve had some really nice days together.
[leaning against Creed's desk] So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party.
The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.
Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He���s putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I���ve done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight���only good surprises. ���Guten Pranken���. [chuckles]
OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?
What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?
I don't think we have to do this again cause it's gonna take a whole. [everyone clinks glasses]
Those are like my favorite movies. I didn't really think you could win Desert Island, but I think you just did.
No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'.
You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?
No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair.
I���m taking some time off from work���well, my other work���because we needed it.
Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.
Can you figure out how to upload Cece���s dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.
Alright, I���m gonna go warm up the car.
I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?
Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.
Well, I mean, I don���t even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so��� These things go down all the time.
I don���t know. I���ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
Well we are here now, so let's just--
Uh, I think you dropped this [hands over piece of paper]
Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes]
What about music?  Do you have any music?
Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything.
Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.
[Michael in his office playing music loudly, Jim walks in and turns the volume down, Michael trailing off on singing]  We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.
Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20.
I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.
I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.
Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.
Anything. [Dwight begins to fill his new purse] Good. Yup.
[goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait.
[to camera, holds up a bean] Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture [walking around the table] of who you think deserv-- who's that? [picture that Michael drew of toby, looks like a monster]
[looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled 'administrative' and 'assistant.'
Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
Dwight, come on. Don���t end on a bad note.
Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.
I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.
Nope.  Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office]
Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.
You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing���none of these people are good enough.
I don���t know. He wasn���t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn���t hire his wife.
Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don���t worry. I���ll figure it out.
By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?
Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.
We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an 'Andy for Manager?' pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.
We tried to find the fairest way to do it.
Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.
When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.
Okay, I can't find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found 'em.  They're here.
But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.
That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.
Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one [holds up paper]. Originally given by Benito Mussolini.
Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that.
I don't know how we'd go about doing that.
Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.
I don���t know what to tell you, man.
What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...
[puts his phone in his coffee mug and calls Gabe]
Don't. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator.
No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back.
Oh, yeah, so we���ll just do that later.
All right!  [sitting down behind Michael's desk] I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but...
Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore. [Dwight follows red cord through office past Phyllis' and Stanley's desks]
Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?
Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case���let���s get to work.
Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.
Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play?
And as you know, I was a paper salesman. [whispers to Darryl] Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked. [group overhears and chuckles]
Ah, dinner.  Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.
[cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.
Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?
I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.
Not gravel, obviously. [both chuckle] No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-
Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date.
Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'.
What?  I did not do that.  That sounds disgusting.
[swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine?
Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.]
Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--
[closes folder] You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?
Uh, by the way. Have you heard Dwight say the word immunity, yet? Because if I can get Dwight to say the word immunity, it might be the greatest day of my life.
[Dwight hands Jim a piece of paper] Oh, what's this?
