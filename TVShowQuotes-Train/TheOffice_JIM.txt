Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.
I don���t.
And we don't know how.
I found Dwight's wallet in the parking lot.
Mmm...
I don���t know, for such a crazy number I���d like something pretty crazy.
[on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.
Good.
Oh good, so we don't have to work.
Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?
Yeah, you never know.
Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?
Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.
Take it easy.
No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.
Yeah!
Well I think Meredith was just --
Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.
Right.
And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it.
In Philadelphia.
Dwight come on, come-
Yeah.
When?
I bet we would.
I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.
Oh, I-
That is not the expression.
Yeah.  Sure.
And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.
Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?
All right.
Getting my wife a week off from work.
Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first.
Oh, hi.
OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
Mmhmm.
That was slightly harsh, don't you think?
No one's moving!
OooOK.
Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
Oh, God. [hangs up phone]
[reading from computer] ���Side effects of EMF include: headaches...���
Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?
Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play?
Alright. I will definitely do that.
We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in.
Fantastic.
[seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. 'Soo-ven-yay.' Mr. 'Jacques Soo-ven-yay.' Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
I think today was a good day to have two managers.  'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing.  But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy.  It's because they're doing it for the kids.  And I get that now.
You know what?
Yeah, bigger actually.
Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.
I bet.
Okay.
No.
Is that really what you think?
OK, great.
Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents...
Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these.
Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.
Are you serious?
New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?
Birthday.
Wait a minute, what is this?
That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit...
Oh, yeah, it sounds like it.
Great. [Jim and Pam walk away]
You look a little worried.
Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
Hey.
Yes, he did.  You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.
I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.
Classic.
No? Come on.
Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.
Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.
By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.
I can't believe you guys.  I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over.
No, I didn't.
Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown.
Yeah?
Yeah!
Oscar?
Hmm...
There is one condition, Michael.
And then you'll be saved.
Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!
Elaborate.
[picks up phone] Jim Halpert.
It wasn't me.
Unforgivable.
Oh��� okay. Where would we go?
Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
You knew it.
Uh, you know, we'll see, we'll see.
Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
No it's not.
Okay. Thought people read more books.
Yeah?
I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
It's 'cause I'm more of a player.
Yeah?
Wow. Oh!
No.
[Jim Face]
I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand]  Just the guys.  Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem.  I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.
You couldn't of memorized that?
No, can't.
We don���t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-
[Dwight and Andy stacking boxes rapidly] Nice.
Yes, let's have a word.
Michael, look I'll just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.
Thank you, sir. [Tips his glass to Daryl]
Okay. And how do you feel?
Okay.
Athleap.
What?
[sighs]
[attempts to shake Dwight's hand] Goodbye, Dwight.
Leave the telescope.
He did pick a good one.
I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working.
[on voicemail] Hey, it's Jim.  Leave a message.
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.
An urban thing...
Alright, I���m gonna go warm up the car.
Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her.  It'll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy.  Uh... June.  Summer.  So, that'll be nice.  And that's that.
Wow That's terrible, I really liked him.
I know!
They���re terrible.
Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
I don���t know how else to tell you.
Yikes.
I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.
Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.
No, I'm not making bread.
Yeah.
That's because Mark's my roommate.
Yeah.
I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.
Oh, there he goes.
You knew it.
I don���t know what to tell you, man.
Look, Pam, I don���t know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It���s gone. That moment���s just gone. I missed it.
I'm the one who complained about you.
No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You're way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.
I'm on it.
So Pam was right?
That's not a good idea.
[mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?
That doesn't exist anymore.
Nobody tell him!
I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.
I don't know.
Yes! [as other costumed actors come in and join Andy in song]
Two for two, keep it up.
Except pass that breathalyzer.
Whoops.
Okay that's five.
Michael - [Michael signs] Great.
That's true.  That's right.  Yeah.
A formal warning, seriously?
What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
You play? [referring to keyboard]
You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?
All right!
They weren���t really talking that much about money. They just said, We���re good with investing and then I...and I...
Wow, that is delicious.
That's harsh.
No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?
Oh, I don't smoke. Sorry.
To one without a cubicle.
[to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay. [runs]
How many words per minute does the average person type?
I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...
You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it���s just gonna make you cry?
How you doing?
Dwight!
Thank you.
Right. There, first...
Tell 'em.
Thank you.
Oh, you guys doing a little construction?
I'm sorry, wait, so is the question 'How'd I get to be so awesome?' [laughs] Because, I don't have an answer for you. [laughs]
What are you doing?
That would be fun.
Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?
I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes.  Tadah!
I'm sorry?
Thanks.
Okay.
Oh no?
All right, what the heck? Let's do it.
I guess I will swallow my truth.
Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so...
Wow. [cup tinkles]
Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
Oh my god. That's less romantic.
No thanks.
Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.
Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it.
Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that. [Dwight smiles at Jim] Really? Smirking?
Who's that?
Oscar, how are you on that side?
[after Darryl eyes him drinking from a thermos] It's mine. Don't worry.
Don't. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator.
No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!
[slinking out of the room] Alright, you are welcome.  I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.
You got it.
No, not at all.
Nothing. Guys? Timer's still going? Er?
You are bleeding through your shirt.
So, terrible idea.
That's inspired.
Yeah.
Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.
Bye.
So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal.  It's Lackawanna County.  Our whole county.  And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch.  And I could work here for years.  And years.  [groan] Years.
Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?
Can I go?
[hangs up Michael's phone, leaves room]
Hey, Dwight. It's Jim.
Not gonna change.
[unbelievingly] Okay...
Oh, thanks man.
Nope.
My charity is the Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's Department, because Dwight's a Volunteer Sheriff. So I thought this was a perfect opportunity to support/mock him.
Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.
Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
[entire office is chatting] I'm saying, all I'm saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying.
Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.
Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
Alright!
OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?
Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.
Hum.
I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?
Is there really?
Is that really how you want to get this job?
Good. What? Nothin'
[Pam storms out of the break room] Hey...
Thanks a lot guys, Good job.
Six-month anniversary. What?
Hey!
Oh, well, Dave is an adorable baby.
Anything. [Dwight begins to fill his new purse] Good. Yup.
What do we want?!
MmmHmm...
Absolutely not.
Hey.
Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago.
Nope.
Sounded good.
Oh, they're my client.
No.
All right.
How long have you been a man?
...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.
The empanada guy!
Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?
OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
Oh, great.
No, no, no, no...
What?
When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. ��I just wanted... to go home. ��This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013. ��You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space.
This... is Parkour. [turns laptop to camera, shows Parkour instructional video] Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. [Michael is shown climbing/walking on various objects in office] The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.
So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.
You know what?  I'm just going to call a cab from here.
Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?
Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.
Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
No, I'm serious. There's always something better.
So, don't tell.
Okay. [keeps eyes open]
Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?
Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.
What does that mean?
The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
I'm really sorry. I can't do it.
Totally reasonable.
Hello.
Not my favorite, but...
No... sport.
[whispers] That's a good point.
Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam.  Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
Michael, you shouldn't have done that.
Andy, where are you?
Wow, hey.
Wow.
Right.
Okay. This is it.
Cool. Thanks. [puts his hat on Erin's head]
We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just - [blows air] - all in.
That's ok.
Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
Hm hm.
Essential.
Are you really gonna marry him?  [Pam nods] ...Ok.
How can you even be sure?
Scared me.  How's the party planning going?
Exactly. Here we go. Let's do it.
Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?
I know.
Ah, show me how this works.
I will.
[to Pam] Hey.
OK
The big gun thing. [Dwight grabs at phone] Stop!
Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.
Wow.
Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.
Nope.
Post-it Notes. Wow, that purse holds a lot.
Dwight!
Ohh! Good-bye.
If anyone can do this, you can do this.
Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman.
: Uh, is that it?
I have one, too. Jim. Jim, Is Jim. My name is Jim.
Well, Dwight's a purple belt, so...
What are you doing?
Is that not what happens when you're high?
We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.
What?
Alright.
Nope, it's because it's genitalia.
[on phone] Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background]
No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think.
What do you mean?
Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...
What happened to you?
Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here.
And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
Cathy, go.
[holds up the retrieved lead] It involves you too.
I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn���t love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid���wonderful���boring���amazing job.
You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.
Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
Do you honestly believe that?
No, thanks. You having fun?
David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.
Hey Pam! How are you?
Okay, I will. [idiot voice]
He definitely stole my iPod.
Either way, Dwight��� I can���t be there for you. I���m sorry.
Well it���s sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
The one I have. I'll use the one I have.
How many shoes do you need?
He never called a meeting.
Oh.
Good night.
That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.
Oh no, we're just sitting here.
Uh, Larissa Halpert.
DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
Hey, David. You got Jim here.
I love you, too.
[Gently taps Pam on the forehead] Tied up.
Hey, Abby. I wanted to give you this for all your hard work today. Look. Michael signed it and everything. Official.
Nothin' much what's up with you?
[office phone rings at Jim's desk] This is Dwight.
Mm-Kay, Well, it can't be zero, Kev.
No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith���s face.  And if that  makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.
Oh, yikes.
O-Kay.
Absolutely correct.
There is soda inside.
Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn���t going to show up?
Anything else?
Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses.  Uh, four dollars.  And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble.  And that's a grand total of... [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars.
We got to see Ping.  [Pam nods] And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. [Pam nods] Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. [Pam nods] Which for me, has ruined them for life. [looks at Pam, who is staring at him, nodding]
Oh, ok, cool.
Um...
Did you just come up with that?
The mall?
Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time? [Abby nods]
Oh!
[to Eric] You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
I think you mean a girl's
That's increadible.
Oh, are you firing Creed?
Bye.
To what?
Okay.
No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.
Dwight, come on. Don���t end on a bad note.
You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.
Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.
You're breathing very heavily.
All right.
All right.
Yes.
Hey, alright.
Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay.
Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott.
Really did [Text bleep] He responded L-O-L.
What are the two levels?
But ..
No big deal.
Dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level. And he apparently has a girlfriend, so... I guess there really is someone for everybody.
What?
He's fine. He's indestructible.
[thinks] The friendships.
Dwight! Dwight!
Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20.
Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.
So, the plan was seven minutes.  But we're calling an audible, because that's her call.  Because she's the quarterback.  I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten...
Oh-ho, I am in.
Yeah.
A small blonde woman?
But you're leaving...
Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.
I'm trying, yup.
You can't do this.
I don't-
You really think you can make it up to me with food?
Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?
[taps car] Lincoln.
What?
Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
Ferris Bueller.
Okay, make a commercial.
Yeah. I like talking to her too.
But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.
Tell me about it.
Okay. Have you ever seen the movie Sixth Sense? Maybe you are already dead.
Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
Wow.
What's that?
That's a lot of reasons! [suspicious]
Whoa. Who is this guy?
Alright, we're driving ourselves, actually.
We're gonna stay.
Everything's fine.
That makes sense.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, I did. [they kiss]
You really don't have his phone number?
Yeah. All right. Bye. [Kevin sinks putt] All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?
Oh initially I did.
Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually.
Thanks.
No, it's not 'ugh.' It is... office camaraderie.
[to Pam] Wait for it.
Oh wow.  So that���s two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
985,000,000,000,017.00
Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.
Potential future nonsense.
Thank you.
I would love to hear the other mottos.
I have to.  Pam, if I'm not there, someone's going to go to jail.  Or die.
You are not my superior.
Mmm-hmm.
Ok.
Why?
Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?
Umm, what happened?
Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.
Nice.
Michael went in there with him too.  It's pretty sweet.
Hey, how are you and Darryl?
[hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done.
Yeah.
Michael, this is a conference room meeting.
You all right? You ok?
Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe.
Left.
Mmm-hmm.
Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too.
Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?
Michael.
You buy a purse.
Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.
This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, 'just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.'
It stopped.
You gonna wish me luck?
I know. It's very cute.
I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.
What are you talking about?
Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
Is that it?
And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]
No, they don't.
You gotta play along man.
No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please.
I'm not talking to you.
All right. ��Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues]
[singsong voice] Who wants a hot chocolate?
But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.
Yeah. At least for one more dance.
[naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?
How'd you get gum in your hair?
Hey! Can I talk you? For a second?
Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
[sarcastically] Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started. [starts to write on a piece of paper]
-I'm just gonna watch.
Kathy wants to leave our clump?
[inspecting the hole in the wall] Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall.
Well, the grass is always greener.
Hey, of course.
Oh, sure.
I'm sorry, Phyllis.
Yes--
Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.
Yeah, you don't have to, ummm.  Alright, yes, that's not gonna be awkward at all.
All right-
I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
Here you go again! What is your deal today?
Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.
[hands David his papers] There you go.
No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk.
You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
[Pam starts sipping an empty glass] I think those might be empty.
Wow.
That's okay. [Hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby] Oh, no, it's not. I'm sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?
Bye.
What are you doing?
Ah! [Harry walks in]
Not much what's up with you?
Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, she's so beautiful!  Oh, my God.
Wait, there's not gonna be a shotgun?
Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
Okay.
What about a gift basket full of cash?
What?
It would look bad.  Sorry.
Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything.
I think you mean The Sting.
Inappropriate.
Wait, should I have left the car running? [both laugh]
Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.
You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
Yeah.
Okay, okay.
So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.
Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?
I know.  Yeah, it's...kinda--
Whoa, whoa.
Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.
Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
Hey man. I am so sorry about that.
[ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what?
Why not?
Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.
He didn't mention me, did he?
You alright, Santa?
Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to...
Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here.
Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-
What kind of offer?
You're good... you're good at sales.
Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didn't tell you that.
[whispering, going into the bathroom with Cece] Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!
Nice job.
Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.
Wow. Alright. Can���t wait to meet her.
[Whispers] Please stop that!
Ha ha ha.
Okay.
Does Mose have nightmares?
Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that.
You watched it.
I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.
Time. Space. Gender. [Dwight mouthing words] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] No, that���s --
Guy's going by. Shh.
Sure.
[Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course
I understand that.
It's not--- It's not about me.  I mean, this your dream.
Okay.
Come on.
Two minutes...
Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.
Oh yeah, definitely.
Which one?
[interrupting] That Pam's pregnant.
Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.
Oh, I like you.
Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.
[shudders] Whew.
OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
What about, uh.. [points at Meredith]
Oh, thanks man. Appreciate that.
Really?
Do I?
We do.
That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom.
Yep, it's English, it's 'impossible.'
I didn't say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.
Look at that.  Bob ordered hot food.
They do?  So, cars are flightless airplanes.
Oh, Pam? Can I see you in here for a second? It's important, so...
Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that.
[as Pam screams]  Doing great, push again.
Louder, son!
Hey Dwight.
Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.
Most apartments these days have like three.
Ready?
Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
So good.
Peepa.
[waiting outside the bathroom for Pam, he is holding a hand-picked bouquet of flowers and pacing] These are for you.
Just about... yup. Now.
Okay.
Good, how are you?
Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along.
It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about?
Nope.
That's great
No, was it good?
No she doesn't wa- She's not here.
Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.
No, I...
She's... high-maintenance.
We should go on a double date.
You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
It was not rotting.
Alright. [Kelly squeals]
[answering phone] Jim Halpert.
What about cars?
To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?
I did not do this.
Yup.
Alright. Let's clear this up. [on phone] Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?
I was blue group, so it was second from the top.
Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
Dave.
That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
Captain Crunch.
[laughs and swings his arm out which doesn't come close to touching the reception desk] I'm always this close.
Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don't. Riveting.
[picks up the phone] Michael Scott here.
Andy!
Katie Holmes.
Okay.
I'm not.
Agoraphobic?
Okay.  That is me, but I didn't order the cake.
No way.
Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?
[overlapping with Pam] Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed.
I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people.
Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard.
No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?
Right.
Hey.
All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this.
He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
You're only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but.
Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?
Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
Permission denied.
The future mother of my children.
You can't lay down.
OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.
[sighs] I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.
Toby works here again.
I bought it.  It's ours.  Let's go inside, I'll show you inside.  [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor.  Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet.  Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall]  Yeah, I am really sorry about this.  I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there.  Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.  [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so... [shuts the door]
Done.
Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.
Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
[hugs Dwight] Congratulations, buddy.
You have a toothbrush.
Where we going?
Oh, I can do that.
Stanley, please, this is serious!
An Earl Grey tea for the lady.
What's gay-dar?
Really? I thought I'd take Roy.
Who was driving?
Okay, 'A,' Halbert. And, 'B,' I think a more appropriate statement would be, 'The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests.'
[while Dwight and Kelly are arguing] Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
About you two hitting it off.
It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. [Towards unseen cameraman] Is bold the right word?
Okay, so what do you want to do?
That's okay.
No, no, dude, no.
Nope. Baskets have it.
Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or���
[In staff meeting] See these forms...
How far away did you think we were?
You still do that thing?
Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands - including Pam]
The last���
Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?
I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?
You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.
Hmm? No.
The office.
So, how was the resort?  Did you ski a lot?
She is dating Ryan, I think.
This is way more than I make now.
Closed. [Michael leaves his office, gives Jim two thumbs up, which Jim returns]
I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he���s gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it���s not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It���s strange.
Nobody asked, Bob!
Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?
Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, let's go to the hospital.  Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.
You could just be saying it to get the job.
Don't.
You know I have to do this.
He can't hear you?
Customers have to use the coupon code from the website.  And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.
[points at bearded man] Who's that?
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we���re just starting couple���s counseling. Uh, which doesn���t sound any better.
Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things.
Oh... Good.
You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing���none of these people are good enough.
Oh Dwight, Dwight, [Dwight pukes on his back windshield]  Ohhhhhh!
Andrew.
Well, I tried. [Michael laughs]
Ok.
Well, turns out he actually made it up there.
Absolutely, yes.
Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head:  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.
Wish you were home.  Uh, anyway...
You're creeping me out.  I'm gonna go.
What?
Shh!
Right, the one from England.
Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.
I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.
OK, sure. Let's do it. [Pam laughs]
Here we go.
Ow!
But there is a reason why I'm here!
Hey.
No. We're not.
Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years.
What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing.
Into a lake.
That's-
Members of the office, hear ye.
[on the phone] Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great. [goes into a private room where Pam and the doctor are, the voices are inaudible, but the camera can see through a window, Pam and Jim look in shock, they hug and Jim goes back out into the hall to call Dwight back, trembling] Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs! [laughs] Ohh! [goes back into the room to hug Pam]
What?  What?
One Charlie's Angels. One. Let's go.
It is right. I mean, it's impossible.
Yes, okay. Bye.
He plays piano?
Well, I think you look great.
You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.
Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on. [to everyone] Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. [to Katy] Desert Island. Five movies. Go.
No, that wasn't fun.
Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them.
No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
Oh, OK.
Ding Dong.
How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.
Yeah?
Oh.
Yes.
Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?
You up for a game?
[Pam is asleep, resting her head on Jim's shoulder] Um... Hey.
No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.
All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.
If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...
Hmmm, I don't think so. Nope.
That is me. Wish me luck.
Which one?
That's very...
Don���t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.
Uh hum.
OH, that's great. I'm really happy for [starts to walk away]
Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if he's, see if he's back.
OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me.
[grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.
No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.
Stanley. Stanley.
Obviously.
[off camera] ...what?
I think you should retrace your steps.
Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.
Yeah.
Is that your office?
I'm going with grape.
Thank you for all of this. This is so helpful. You know what? One last question. Um, who is that fine older gentleman in the corner? [points to Creed]
Right? I was just thinking...
Holly, will you marry me?
I���m just gonna call you back. Thanks.
Alright.
But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon.
I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok?
Because you said 'do you wanna hang out'-
Hey, and if you���re ever in Austin...
Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.
Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.
Right, cause that's what we are talking about.
Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...
No.
Conference room?
Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.
I can't believe how bad this looks.
[holds up card] This one's a map.
All right.
Nope. I'm numbering the paper.
Okay.
Let's find out. [starts typing]
That's good. You know, with the kid.
Me, too.
I got it.  Alright.
Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.
Alright buddy.
What?
What?
Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.
Great. What's new with you?
Love you too. Bye.
Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.
Hey.
[Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.
It's a real handsome duck.
Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.
Yeah!
No.
But he did, right?
Boy I---
I have no idea where we���re gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.
Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
And you went to New York to do this.  So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?
You know, it's getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.
Where's Dwight?
Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.
Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.
Love it. Keep it goin.
All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... [to Dwight] what is this?
Funny? No? Nobody laughing?
The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes!
Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.
Right.
OK.
Yes. All right. Great. [leaves]
At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it.  I'm told it started as a team building exercise.  Unfortunately I really suck at it.  We didn't play many video games in Scranton.  Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor.  And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus.
Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.
Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
You wouldn't dare.
What?
So you're not doing it.
Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults.
Don't open your eyes.
Mmhmm, yeah.
I don't know what else we can do here.
Yes.
Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.
Oh, I don't know.
[hovering over Meredith's desk] Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.
Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?
Dwight, don't be gross.
So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright! [knocks on side of truck]
Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.
[Jim and Pam are walking outside] I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.
Doesn���t seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
[to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
Pam.
Well, then keep it.
Wow. Psychopath.  [Karen grins widely at Jim]
Yes.
And that's why it's on my desk, Phyllis; it means a lot to me, and now that I know it was from you, it means even more.  Moving on!  Uh, ok, so that's the end of the tour for now, and if you liked it please tell your friends: 'Whenever you're in Scranton, visit Casa de la Halpert'.
Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?
[to Karen] Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. [Karen steps into lake] Yes!
This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.
Do I have any say in this?!
[sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome.
Good!
Hey.
You're right, we didn't dance.  It was more like, swaying.  But still romantic.
No.
I'm sorry? Pam.
[laughs] It���s called Ghostbusters.
Uh, yeah, ream.
Ah, good. Good luck. Doing good. [goes to the index cards and writes another race down]
Forget it.
Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?
None of this is time sensitive.
Oh, wow. That's cool.
[to Michael] It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
Oh. Any team sports?
Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
Yeah.
Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.
No. No.
Hey.
He plays guitar, he likes naval history. He's a bowler.
Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
Dragging.
Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret.
I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.
Okay, that is a 'no' on the on the West Side Market.
Oh no. I was just -
Yeah. Okay, maybe.
Mm-hmm.
Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?
[Jim and Pam approaching the wedding venue] Is this his house?
OK, Kenny.
Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I'll... I'll finish explaining the rules. Let's... let me explain it first, and then...
O..ok. Um..good.
This shouldn't happen at work.
Hmmm, I'd say 1 in 6.
I tried. He will not listen.
You writing your name over there?
You were right.
No, no, no.
Got to be kidding me.
So what is the problem?
Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously.
Yup...
Why is that, why is that weird?
That is good.
Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write?
Not Night at the Roxbury.
Um, what's going on here?
To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.
It was.
[chuckles] He's so cute.
You should actually thank Erin, she's the one who agreed to babysit.
All right, guys, stop.
But that doesn���t matter. This does. It���s the only thing that matters. We���ve had some really nice days together.
Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
That's pretty funny.
Definitely not.
I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.
All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
Austin Powers.
Let's start with... your mom.
The Beets Motel? That is, wow.
Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading 'Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!']
All depends on the conference room meeting itself. [phone chimes] Uh, okay.
Dwight, he's gonna kill the store.
What?
You all right? [Oscar nods]
[on phone] I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
I [drops out] at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please don't call again.
What?
See how easy that is?
Yes. You don't love Holly.
Yeah.
[on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.
I'm sure it's fine.
That's the Christmas spirit.
Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry. [Pam looks at Jim] Sorry. I think I'm just hungry.
Because not everybody knows about the party.
[singing the intro to The Lion King's 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight'] A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
That's pretty cool.
Oh. Oh!
Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.
Okay.
Andy.
Oh, nothing.
[on phone] Hold on one second.
Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
Interesting, what's that like?
It was-
Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward.
Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.
I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] ...no.
Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?
Alright.
Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.  [someone dims the lights, signifying that it's game time]  Ok, see you next week.  Bye.  [to Karen] Again?
-give him to me and... perfect.
It's stupid. It's, it's just office pranks.
He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!
Uhhh.  Can't.
We should take a look at those surveys.
um��� I mean-
No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.
You know what? Maybe we should talk.
After you sir.
And that's when I knew. You?
So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
[whispers to Pam] Ok, your turn.
It didn���t have a buster sign around him?  Why don���t you draw him?  Why don���t we see this whole thing.
Wow, what do you put our chances at?
Mm-hmm.
[as he and Pam flip their cards] John Stamos.
How much did you pay for it?
[Gets up and looks out Nellie���s office window] He���s running!
Yeah, yeah.
No, I'm not gonna call you that.
No. Let's talk for a long time.
Absolutely not.
Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.
Seriously!
Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?
Try this. [takes Dwight's 'Asian' race and switches it with the one he wrote]
Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don���t want to meet that person.
Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
What?
I had plans to meet a friend tonight.  Which I had to cancel.  But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer.
Not really a question. [starts to laugh] Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk.
Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.
I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.
Pam?
Nobody's for.
No, like baseball. A baseball team.
Oh yeah?
Hey.
Do you want a corn dog?
And I took it right back. It was like...
No, why would you think that?
Michael! Michael, pull over!
[in Darryl and Jim's Philly apartment] Hey.
Is that the buzzer from Taboo?
Come on Dwight! Use words.
You mean your thoughts and feelings?
Truce?
I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.
Okay.
You're welcome.
Wow, that is��� wow.
That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?
At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision.
Um. He sticks to his guns.
[shoe falls while climbing ladder] Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. [grunts] Creed. I was never here, all right?
Yeah, gotta eat somewhere.
Thanks. [both eat cake]
I'm not going to Utica right now.
[sounds of a car crash] What was that...
Are you sure you���re okay with me putting in this much money.
I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?
[on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.
Okay.
I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.
We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.
[on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]
Seriously?
Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...
[ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.
Hey.
Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad.
Wow.
All right.
No, no. I want to hear you tell it.
Right?
Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
Yes.
Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.
Hey, you have a second?
It���s from the teapot. Everything you���ll ever need to know is in that note. [Pam reads the card] Not enough for me? You are everything.
[to camera, holds up a bean] Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture [walking around the table] of who you think deserv-- who's that? [picture that Michael drew of toby, looks like a monster]
Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.
Oh, you don't know her.
That's what I'm saying.
That I thought we were millionaires.
Private Room.
Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.
Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.
No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this!
Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that.
I'm couching it!
[On the phone with Dwight] Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.
Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? [pause] I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.
We have plenty.
Ah, they moved the shower.
Chapter 4 ��� One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?
Pull over, pull over!
[to Michael] Why is Packer back?
We should probably get back.
Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or...
Michael, I told you.
No.
[makes kissing, puckering sound]
Well, there is no inner...circle.
I just���really wish there was something I could do. [looks off]
I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one.
Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you���re not the best with the phone.
That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot.
Oh, that could be interesting.
For me, it was.
Am I going down a road?
Who else is he mean to?
Which we are.
I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So���my pitch is���me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.
Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger.
Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.
Alright.
I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh]
[Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.
False.  Black bear.
No, I really don't want to.
Ooh, easy. That's not it at all.
Ten. It was the full ten.
Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three.
I did... say that.
You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
That's it.
It's locked.
Here we go. [Meredith's phone rings. Jim and Andy groan.]
[at company picnic] All right, you ready for this?
Wow. Busy morning.
Okay.
It���s, it���s nothing.
Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.
[Michael is seen debating on whether to come back in to the office] Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?
Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece?
Alright! Let's do it.
Which Spice Girl?
Yeah.
[clears throat] I am ready.
Good to see you, too.
What?
Hey.
Let's give it a shot.
Got it.
All right? I���m gonna wait.
You all right? What���s going on?
[scoffs] I... will never say a word.  And now, we are even.
I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.
[reads demerit] 'Jim Halpert, tardiness.' Ugh. I love it already.
Nope.  Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office]
Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
Pam?
Ok, so that's a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. It's pretty smart, right? [walks into Vance Refrigeration office] Hi, how you doing? I'm Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.
Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?
Sorry.
I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope]
Space dust.
Alright.
[Michael in his office playing music loudly, Jim walks in and turns the volume down, Michael trailing off on singing]  We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.
Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.
Oh, she's good actually.
I disagree.
Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?
Okay, great-
Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.
No way. Let's do this [crumples post it and throws into mug. Misses.] Oh.
Yup, coming. [opens door] All right.
Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?
Do Snowboarders hate animals?
What are you talking about?
Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.
[not watching Mose]  More spins.
He knows what he's doing.
Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'.
Oh, come on!
Well, I mean.
Nope, not at all.
Alright.  Time to go.  Okay.
Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement.
Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.
Good-bye.
Everyone. Everyone just keeps looking at me.
Don't beat yourself up.
Me neither. Whew.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... [shrugs] Oh well.
No, not exactly.
I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.
I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.
So happy right now.
Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?
Michael's stupid scavenger hunt.
Yes.
Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six.
That'd be great.
No one.
[as Pam stares at him] I can feel you looking at me.
[laughs] You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office]
Ah, hey.
What happened?
Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close?
I think we'll be okay.
Really?
Did you break the shredder Kevin?
Come on, Michael says we should go now.
And who cares?  It's a stupid veil, right?
Hey, do you guys have any other games?
Yes, it is harassment and I'm going to be suing the winking face. I've hired the angry face as my lawyer and you will be hearing from him pretty soon.
Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
Right.
But you just met her.
Anything would help.
Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
No, you can't fire me.
Ok.
Stop what?
[looks at camera] What?
OK.
No.
Psst. You think this thing's gonna go much longer?
I don't... I don't think so.
Yeah. You know what? I���ll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.
Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.
Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!
Who is it?
Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.
Oh, my God! Wow.
What?
Now how do you know how it works?
No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so...
What a night.
5 dollars.
That was a great idea.
Um... What's in the bag?
Uh...
And in this room here, if you look closely, you will find out a few clues about who lives here.  Um, he likes biking, obviously, and uh, what else?  Uh, he likes tour guides, I guess.  And if you're very perceptive, you'll notice that he didn't do a great job of cleaning his room [kicks water bottle under bed].  Ok, and uh, that's the tou-
I didn't have anything, Jan.
What?
[Irish accent] Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us.  Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.
So instead of working, you want...
Ooh... fancy.
Hi! [Awkward]
Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?
Okay, DVDs. Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Toby, go ahead.
We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?
I think you're right.
That's it.
Look at that one though, he's smiling!
What have we got here?
You are?
No, we used to. Now we're friends.
Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so... [imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles, Michael comes over by Jim laughing]
Not much.
If your client likes Italian food, you bring him to Cugino's.  And if your client likes a little action, you bring him a gambler.  And if your client hates Cornell, you bring him Andy.
Well, that's--
Hey. It���s nothing. Alright? I���ll text you when we get there. Let you know what���s going on.
Oh, I expected more from young Halpert.
You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.
Do you?
I am working on it.
Thanks for inviting us, by the way-
Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
Kev's out.
I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise. [taps Bluetooth earpiece] Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.
That's not true.
I said I was working on it.
Do you take requests?
I think I left my wallet in your house.
M. Night Shulman?
And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.
Beesly, are you threatening me?
She looks at it when she���s on the potty, and she makes the faces.
Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?
Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.
[snaps back] No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand. [half of office raises hand] Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand. [other half of office raises hand]
Yeah?
Cugino's pizza.
You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.
It's fire.
Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here.
Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!
I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa.
We're going to the hospital, Michael.
Nice.
Oh. Hadn't noticed.
Whoa.  Whoa.  Wait.
Ummm... no idea.
Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?
It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.
Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Dwight, Dwight.
Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.
What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.
[Opens folder and reads from Dwight's file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
How?
You sure?
Right! [Jim laughs as he answers the phone] Hey, what's up? Everything ok?
Probably.
No, we're good. Thank you, though.
Every time there's a silence, your brain's like 'Heh-heh-huh-huh' [imitating crying].
Ok.
Right. Let's do some good.
I'm Jim. [Jim hi-fives Abby] Annnnd... let's sell some paper.
Okay. I���ll talk to you tomorrow.
Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.
Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen...[Jim bites his lip again] You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!
You know, I just think you should know that-
Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing.
It's all good. Are we all good?
Why?
Oh, this looks promising.
I saw the movie. I just don't know every line from the film.
No.
Yes.
Yeah.
Oh, cool. [opens his plastic bag]
Hey, Ryan. How's it going?
You making this up as you go along, aren't you?
No way.
No.
Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.
Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people...
What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? [Pam laughs] Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.
I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
Well, Andy has a mug just like that.
You know what?  Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition?  I'd love to see that dunk of yours.
He's gonna throw up.
Oh, thank you. I've been working out.
Do you want to play-
Lord, beer me strength.
I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
Mmm-hmm.
[Phone rings] Oh God.
Nope, just going to see Pam.
She's not your grandmother, is she?
Hypothetically. Hypothetically you were making out in the woods.
Having a great time.
I can't hear you.
Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but...
Cryogenics. Beer me five.
Really.
Cause there was dinner, by candlelight.
Nothing.
Oh.  Like nobody.
Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.
It's pretty good actually.
Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why.
Wrong, for so many reasons.
Nope. It's over.
And I have started a business in Philadelphia. [Pam shrugs]
Uh...
Well you gotta figure this out.
Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or...
Hey.
I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?
Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.
[to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know.
Pam.
What a horrible, horrible movie that was.
Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.
Oh.  Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.
What?
Is that Mose?
Yeah, I think so.
[shaking hands] How are ya?
Why?
I'm just gonna get...
No you don't.
Alright.
Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?
That's an overreaction.
It's a killer new dance move. [re-enacts leaning back] Do you wanna talk in your office?
[Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you're going up there?
All right. Take care.
A semester?
Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish?
Right.
I'll just leave that suit in your office then.
What a great year for the Dundies.
The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
You got it.
Yep.
Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in��� March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so��� [sits on floor]
[pointing to computer monitor] So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view. [picture of Dwight and Mose on a see-saw]
Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.
Well, he'll be here really soon, Kev.
Well, it's what you wanted.
I thought it was a workspace?
Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...that's it. That's really all we were looking for.
Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.
Do you speak Spanish?
No, no, no.
That���s all right.
Take it easy.
Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children?
[sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?
There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for.
Only if you tell me what you're writing.
Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
You know, man, it's really you're call.
Hey, hey. Okay.
I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.
Is that trash talk from Pam?
Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.
Of course I did.
Ok
Puppet.
All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.
Sorry. That was a family emergency.
Thanks Meredith.
Seventy and clear, that's nice. Where's that?
Thanks, yeah.
Second drink?
I don't know.
No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]
Not important.  Because you're not dating her.  Because it's a felony.
I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--
Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.
[sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.
Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
Yeah, it's all right.
[Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.
No, that's Andy's office.
Theater.
I love you.  Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!
Ew, the exact opposite, actually.
[after tense pause] OK. Here ya go. [roughly hands Darryl his thermos]
Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
How old do you think I am?
Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90.
I am Bill Buttlicker.
What?  I did not do that.  That sounds disgusting.
Don't...
Hey.
OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.
What? No.
Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.
I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
Yeah!
[nervous laughter] Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months...
You are?
Congratulations!
No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.
Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?
Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.
[looks bored. Taps finger on desk. Head falls to desk]
Oh hey, Dwight.
What do you want?
Alright, here we go. [taps page] Michael...
Party looks fun doesn���t it?  Everybody seems to be in there having a great time.  So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
Yeah, me neither.
Was that it? No, that wasn't bad.
How old are you?
The mob, maybe NASA.
I wouldn't understand or a secret?
I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again.
Well, I think you handled it pretty well.
Okay.
OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing: I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party.
You hired him?
The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that���s final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I���m not risking that again.
If it's the same thing, then why did you write 'workspace'?
It's still happening right now actually, so uh...
I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.
You���re not serious, are you? You didn���t get any of the recital?
Will they still air 'Rudolph?'
What are you reading?
Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?
He's a jerk.
Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.
No.
Your agenda-taking pleases him.
Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small-[pointing to Angela] Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!
You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?
Okay, that's insanely complicated and the first thing I'm going to do is erase it.
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and we're basically there.
Um, oh man, I don���t actually know.
I just... couldn't wait.
You know what you should do? Take a vacation.
[Christian Slater impression] So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, 'What's going on?' Well, you're not alone.
Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.
[back to Pam] Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.
That is a mistake.
Mm, hey driver. Why don���t you take us to 3030 Adams?
Ahem. This is for you... and [puts blanket around her shoulders] ...Happy Birthday, Kel.
Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker.
No.
No.
But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.
Are you kidding me?
Got it.
Oh, it���s the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela���s been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.
So...ah, who's gonna take the dog?
What's up?
Okay.
No, I'm not gonna do that.
You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.
I don���t even know where the stairs are!
Second.
I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
You know what's crazy?
Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just...
A futon?
So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.
Huh.
[Dressed as Dwight] It's kind of blurry. [puts on his glasses] That's better. [exhales] Question.  What kind of bear is best?
I don't know if I can.
...and paper.
Lousy Picture.
Both.  They're both worse.
Mm-hmm.
Yup.
Yesss. And you're Abby, right?
Not his mom's car.
Let's do it.
Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.
He welcomes you.
Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
Okay, so--
[Andy playing the sitar] Hey.
[Dwight hands Jim a piece of paper] Oh, what's this?
And then an older gentleman asked you 'Boxers or briefs?'
I miss you.
Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
Hey, can't really talk now, what's up?
Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.
Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...
Hi.
Yes.
So Andy is in rare form today.
You know that���s���
Oh, come on, Pam.  I-
Mm-hmm.
Three times.
Really? Does he do good work or--
Jimbo!
You didn't hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
Are you really sure we should be leaving?
Uh hmm.
I don���t know. I���ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
No, let's let her rest.  I'm sure there's still twelve on each.
Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
Hey, Ryan?
[reluctantly] Spinning would be more fun.
Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight.
Why'd you do that?
Today.  Now, maybe.  'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.
No, I told you I don���t like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Can't wait.
No, don't worry about it.  We'll just got double or nothin'.
Go get 'em.
Great.
Michael.
Did you just say you remember him?
Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad.
So you have the directions.
Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right?
I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
Look who���s back.
Really? Way to earn it. Hey, Andy?
All right. [smiles]
No one should be planking at all.
What?
I'll make it worth your while, I promise.
You look great.
No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.
We���ll talk about it later.
Ryan Howard. Ryan! [claps] Gold medal.
Ok.
Pam.
[collects Dwight's weapons from around the office; holds up a hand scythe]
Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires.
You don't even drink tea.
Oh, thank you!
Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.
A- ah--
[answers cell phone] Hey!
Who else we got?
It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.
Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.
Okay.
Thank you for choosing me.
Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
Yeah, that... Yep, that feels about right.
Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right.
I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill.
Those are the books that sum up the other books.
OK...
Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
Are you... interested in her guy friends?
I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
It was pretty uneventful, actually.
Where'd I find what?
Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.
The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
I have nothing to do.
Could, keep that down.
Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.
It is really special.
Was it your scores?
Mmm-hmmm.
Ah, ah, ah. Where's the 'please'? We're not animals.
Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.
We can go.
That���s not it.
Sure.
[over the phone] How old's Kelly?
How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
Nobody!
Not even Harry Potter?
No.
Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.
Come on, get inside.
I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy.  But I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  [reading from various books]  Five to seven minutes.  Five to seven minutes.  Six minutes.  Different, but not really.  Five to seven minutes.
These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one.  [Michael stands on podium] Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal. [everyone claps]
No.
[in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff.
[under his breath] Didn't think you'd notice...
No.
Later, Kev. [Puts French Onion Potato Chips on Pam's desk] Have a good weekend.
Wow.
I thought you liked the store?
Ahh. [puts his arm around Pam]
Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. [starts walking away]
I'm probably never gonna see you again.
Really, what kind of celebrity?
Really?
I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
Cece���s ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I���ve been working with her on her move. It���s called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It���s kind of like this. It���s pretty cute, right?
Yeah, I'm aware of that.  But he's also being super annoying.  And I'm not a perfect person.
Of course.
I did, yeah.
[holds mug next to Andy's head] Make the face. [Andy smiles] Yeah, I don't see it.
1. Here we go! [turns on wipers]
[whispering to Pam in corner of room] So, they know.
Good!
No, I won't.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.
You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!
I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day.  So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna.  ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name.
Really?
Oh, my god!
Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can...
Unless you think he can���t handle it.
Personal conversation.  Seventeen seconds.
Then take a different way home, man!
No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--
Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.
Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.
Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over?
Nothing.
Actually, yeah.
Just... quit stalling.
All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.
Closing ceremonies.
I have no idea.  We went right for the copier.
No. She wasn't.
Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing?
You know what? I could use a little help.
Uh, it's in the lot.
I know. We're pretty excited, too.
So what did he say? Was it my fault?
And, um...
Alright.
[under his breath] Nice to meet you.
Okay.
Is that what happened to you?
Right.
Dammit Dwight!
You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?
I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...
I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- [pulls out a pie chart] How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.
I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
It's hard to tell so far.
Hey, are you kidding me?
Dwight, let me see your coffee cup.
Just one.
And say what?  'Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?'
No, no, no, Stanley.
Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly.
Please?
Absolutely not, I'm mad at you.
What?
Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. God, it's freezing, I gotta go in. You stay though for like five minutes.
Have you ever seen 'em do that? [walk outside and the parking lot is covered with snowmen]
Honestly, I don't mind. [long, awkward pause until thermos is empty] Did you want me to wash it for you or...
Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?
Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.
Yeah. Good to be back.
It's my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello?  Well that's great. [hangs up phone]  Turns out the paper was there all along.
Yep.
Those are the doves.
Yeah, was it 10? Yeah, I have it on a mix tape from junior high.
Oh my God.
Not bad right. [swinging golf club]
And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.
Andy ��� this whole idea of our situation being just like war?  It���s just not true.  We just work at a paper company.  And you���re our regional manager.  And guess what man?  You don���t have to prove anything.  We like you as regional manager.  Andy if you don���t believe me take a look at what���s on my head.  I���m wearing a very pink hat.  I���ve been getting weird looks all day because I���m pretty sure ���DM does GB��� means something kinda sexual.  But guess who���s wearing them?  All of us.  Just for you man.  That���s huge.
Wow. And just out of curiosity, how much is it?
I love their sandwiches too.
Oh my god. That's so romantic.
You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?
Ooh, definitely in my top five.
See, that's weird.
I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.
You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
Yes, he is finally nigh.
Hey.
[front door slams, Kelly walks by] Hey, Kelly.
Yeah.
Caleb!
[on phone] Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. [to office co-workers] Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out. [lowers voice] He said it should just be under an hour, so... [everyone groans] we did it.
Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he���s gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--
That's amazing.
I'm really too tired to do this.
Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the... [Jim bites his lip again and pounds on table]
Good!  What's goin' on here?
What are you watching?
But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.
Aww, best book?
Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk.
Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or...
Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
Green walls.
So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.
If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --
[on cell phone] Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.
Hey, Phyllis, Do you have any games that you play in the office?
[snorts] Ew.
Enjoy, enjoy.
Absolutely.
I know.
I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really...
What is that chestnut?
Our fake winnings
Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.
You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
The next year he really stepped things up.
And I was still just a paper salesman.
You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.
No, I hear what you���re saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?
Ok, um, this is��� [leaves DVD with her]���I���ll be right back.
That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.
Travel.  I've been looking forward to it.  It's gonna be... really nice.  Gonna find myself.
No, we don't.
Mmm...
Yeah.
Back door.
Well, this is William M. Buttlicker.
Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days.  How's your summer?
Yeah.
Mmhm.
No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.
A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?
Things are a little bit... different here in Stamford. [shrug] It's not bad.
Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.
I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment,  is the only one who raises her hand]
Well, I mean, I don���t even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so��� These things go down all the time.
Why would you do that?
Yep, Spongebob Squarepants.
All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
Well, you're... in... prison, but, mmhmm.
Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.
Andy... is having a
Shut up.
[to Pam] What?
Absolutely, I will do that right now.
Nice. Well, what's it all about?
Ugh.
Actually if I had fewer outside classes, I probably wouldn't be stuck here at a paper company.
She does not like him.
Half.
Respectable?
Nice job, I think you got 'em.
Yes. It is.
Hey!
Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it.
Now, were those for the team?
Okay.
I may have told some people that.  I'm nervous.  I'm about to get married.
Oh boy.
No, no, no, definitely, definitely.  Yes.  Next weekend, then.  All right!  I love you, too.
So, where did you learn how to play?
I can't believe it was me.
OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
Oh
I���m gonna try a different spot. Okay?
Alright, let's conference room it up! [everyone is now in the conference room]  Here's the deal guys.  There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.
So I guess I can assume that was personal.
Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone]
Good. I like it. You know what. Pretend to smoke. [Dwight pretends to smoke]
Um... Whoa. [picks up ringing phone][in managerial voice] Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm  hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.
I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.
Why did I transfer to Stamford?  I think that's pretty obvious.  I got promoted!  And you can't beat that view... right?
Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.
Yeah, okay.
Chapter seven: The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.
Loggins and Messina.
Yeah.
Oh no, I didn't want to see you.  Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, I'd say it was equal.  So, good to see you...
Oh, really?
[Overlapping] When's the last time you upgraded your printer?
Really?
So?
Yeah, who'd have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up; smiles]
Maybe we will someday.
By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?
Nice. Third book?
How are we doing on contractions?
I'd say like... 10,000 to 1?
Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into?
Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
How embarrassing is it? That's not fair. Here...
Mm... not really, no.
Yeah. [Doug walks away]
Good luck.'
Darryl, it doesn���t matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.
No, I didn���t notice anything.
Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on.
You're a jackass.
Karen and I are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time. I don't know what to tell you. Right now? Dead heat.
All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to.
You got it.
Yep.
Michael, that is hilarious.
Uh... [looks at Pam]
Hey.
[whistling, places cup of coffee onto Dwight's desk] Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do.
All right, I am connecting and ... you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this:  Go to applications--
You did not have sex with Pam's mom.
[confused] Okay?
Wow. [applause]
Oh yeah.
Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen.
Okay, you know what?
Oh, I'll walk you out.
Aw, thanks, man.
[On the phone] Right, oh let me just check the pricing list.  Hold on one second...
No, actually.
Alright, alright, gang. Let's just settle down. You're yelling in her face.
You are?  [Andy hisses] A cat?
So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.
Hey... [reveal Dwight's Mega-Desk]
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone.
Okay, someone look it up.
I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...
[long pause and then he sighs and nods] Yes.
Hey!  Welcome back!
I think I���m a little too busy these days to s--- [whispering] Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.
Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes.
Yeah, she does like Elmo.
Hey, it's snowing.
Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?
Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.
I wasn't here that day.
Hey, Toby.
That sounds lovely.
Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
Pam!
Pam? Get us back into it.
I made a sale.
All right, I'm gonna go now.
Really?
No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.
Nothing... nothing at all... it's all good!
Oh, yeah
Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
No, I'm not calling Karen.
[on phone] Hey, Brenda.  This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat.  And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right?  Um, so gimme a call back.  You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one.  Yikes.  Uh... give me a call back, I hope.  I'll talk to you later. Bye.
You were right.
Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything.  And mastered the violin.  Oop, and sold more paper.
The minister just told me that it���s tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
Okay now really think hard about this one:  One year.
You good?  I'm just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...
Nellie
Aaah!
Dwight says 'Hi.'
[growling] Nice.
When did you need that rundown by?
Hey it's me. So uh, don't worry. Everything's ok.
Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim.
That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.
What?
Ow, What are you doing? [Jim fights back]
We just passed the exit for Corcroan.
[On phone] ...W R K.
There they are.
You sure?
Well, then I guess you���re ready for this. [gives her the Christmas card]
I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?
Can I have a raise?
Well, yeah I don't want to see her get physically harmed, that's for sure.
She's not really my type.
I just didn't, you know, want a deal.
Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?
How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran.
Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.
Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair.
So, not prison.
Sorry. Her day.
What are you doing here?
A place?
I just needed you to know. Once.
Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So...
You look really pretty.
No, that is what I mean.
No, I mean, great detective work.  'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?
[demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.
True love's kiss.
[enters breakroom] Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.
Kev, have a good weekend.
Mm-hm.
Hey man.
Hey it���s Jim Halpert.  I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight.  Because I���ve read a lot about this really great documentary.
Was that not the--
Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
Hi.
Don't do it.
Is that you singing?
Pam, I���m not explaining this to you-- Pam, I���m not going over this again.
No. Okay. Um, I���ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
Oh my God, Dwight, put that down.
She...
It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.
You okay?
Ah, well I think I'm gonna see Katy.
I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?
Michael, I really didn't mean to...
Thanks Michael.
She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that���s fine.
Alright.
Yeah.  [Jim leans in for a kiss but Pam turns away]  She's fine.
I don���t think it���s-
Are you okay?
No.
My bad.
Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him.  And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.
OK.
Oh.
I'm gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids.
Today of all days...
OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.
Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types]
God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...
Nope.
Not at all, can we go?
Which means absolutely nothing.
Hey.
Okay, just relax. Just need to relax.
Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul.
Hey man.
You are not going to believe this.
I think that's the question that you had...
What?
We are doing worst first dates.
You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.
Hey.
Story's kinda bland.  It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
You'd actually move to Scranton?
I bet I should. [takes cell phone photo] That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you.
Thank you.
Hey.
You mean on a weekend?
[Michael walks in] Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets.  Do you want to-
Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in 'Shagadelic, baby,' at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
No, I don't think so.
I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!
Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause. [group agrees, protests]
Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.
My friend's basement. All right, ready to start?
You know what?  Maybe it's in the ceiling.
Have a good game man.
Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this���
Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly.
Nope.
Wow.
Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?
What?
[Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing?
[laughs] What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?
Yes, beautiful girl in the front.
Good!  Fine!  I've got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee... [dialing phone]
Four months.
Right.
[continues working]
Don't call her 'the mom.'
Guys, what is going on?!  [Pete and Tom burst out in laughter]
Oh... oh!
What?
As a hostage.
Yeah, but I don't smoke.
Yes.
No. We took a walk.
Oh. Is that like your new thing?
Well, then why are you wasting everybody else's time interrogating them?
Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.
Oh yes. Ever since the storm.
Ooh, me three.
Uh--
Yeah.
Now, you listen to me, sir.
-I just don't know if I can do it.
Okay.
Of course.  What is like a hostage?
Mmm hmm.
We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.
I think you seem distracted.
Wow, we're having a little girl.  Oh, man.
Are you not gonna put out the torches?
Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?
We're going to Chuck E. Cheese.
[interrupting] Volunteer duty.
Hey, you got a second?
No.
We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's���I think she understands... what this is.
Oh, did the press ask for a story?
I don't think you understand -
Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.
I don't want to go.
That's Toys R Us, I think.
Hey guys, what're we talking about?
Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.
All right.  Then... it's a date.
Okay. Let's start with the 'I love you' level.
Dwight, you can���t just hire someone ���cause they���re your friend.
Get in the car? [Jim and Pam get in the back seat]
[on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big.
I'm going to take off actually.
Damn.
He's good at his job.  And I like working for him.
Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I���m waiting.
Oh, Aunt Phyllis.
Hey, crazy, um...so...that's it? You're just-you're fine?
To the shame room! [raises bottle]
Hey.
Well, you're pushing the milk out, right?
God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?
Agreed.
Let's go.
And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear.
So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
Is your password Frodo?
[checks sheet] Oh... Deshaun Williams.
There's like ten green ones.
Um, bottomless champagne.
OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
I know, I know.
And the desk.
All right.
Wow, what are we talking about?
Thank you, accounting department.
Wow.
So beautiful. [Pam's starts to cry.  Jim pulls up chair to sit next to her] Hey--
I liked you better when you were the temp.
Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me.
Okay.
Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical.
Oh, loves it.
Yeah. [Pam puts her hand out for an earbud] Definitely.
So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.
Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don���t worry. I���ll figure it out.
You set the bar so high.
Oh, yeah.
I got it.
[picks a card] It's the four of hearts.
[on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.
Oh, tomorrow, that's gonna be tough 'cause I already laid out my outfit, so...
Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?
Nope. Not guilty.
What does that mean?
Well, I can't be the only one who didn't -- [sees mugs on Angela's and Meredith's desks]
Did ya?
Come on Dwight. [sprays Dwight]
You know what? Maybe they just ate.
Or a high school girl. Let's go [mouths 'wow' to the camera].
Probably is.
And doctors.
You know what?
He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.
No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard.
Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Yeah, woah. [deeper voice] Yep, absolutely, go ahead.
Hey, come on.
I am not gonna do this.
Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!
So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.
I do remember, yeah.
Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Sure. That they should do one.
Did you ever see that movie?
Oh, okay. Oh, do... that's what the tape is for. I didn't know.
Oh, wow. So cute.
There���s actually not a rule that says that.
Michael, can I talk to you in your office?
She's, um, she's in New York. She's at an art school.
[Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.
Just check it.
���Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you.���
No, that's your conscience. Listen to it.
There.  Now we're even.  [Pam laughs and mimes taking a picture, they kiss]
I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
[coughs] Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one!
Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.
Thank you very much. It was fun.
[walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?
Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, 'Mom, there's a ghost in my closet.' Now, you say one of two things - one, 'You're just having a bad dream,' or two, 'Let's go see what it was.'
There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.
And you are not going to, either.
Oh, sorry gotta go.
Yeah.  Thank you.
Me, too.
Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.
Oh.
I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.
Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
Oops, that���s my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
You coming down?
Pam's sales are fine actually.
[enters restaurant with Pam] Hey, Brian.
[he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!
Really?
Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company.
You want music?
Which ideally would be me....
Oh, Dawson's Creek.
Why not?
It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven.
Animalian?
I���m very sorry.
Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.
So, you used to share that cubicle with Kelly, right?
She's amazing. This is very exciting.
What?
Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
No...
And a shower.
No, no, no, no.
So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager.
At the Yankees game. Yeah.
Sure.
Oh. Right, that style.
OK, I'm gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael's office] to do some work. So I will be in here.
Well, if Pam says she won���t go, then���[chuckles] we���re gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph.
Awesome, right? [leaves]
See ya. Nice girl.
That's impossible. [Dwight climbs through ceiling hatch] Dwight!
[Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
You define foment.
[laughs]
Okay. The annex it is. I���ll be sitting at your desk if that���s okay with you.
Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
Can I just talk to you for a second?
I���m not doing the Presentation.
Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.
That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, '100% post-consumer content.' What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second.
Ah, gotcha.  Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.
Because my car broke down.
I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates...
You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.
That was one time-
Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.
Have you asked her what she wants to do?
Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.
Not bad.
Oh, oh yeah.
Close.
Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.
Oh man. [laughs]
Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
Got it.  They're like the penguins of the airplane family.
Awesome.
Second-in-command to Michael.
[mimicking Stanley] I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks?
The torches are lit.
And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.
When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?
Definitely.
I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it���s good for the environment too.
Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out.
There it is. Alright.
Uh--
Yeah.
Really?
Definitely can't do that.
Maybe we should just wait and find out.
Pam gets a little down.  Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago.
This is impressive.
Hey, come on.  Let's go to the hospital.
No, I'm not gonna do that.
No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.
Well, I should hope so. [Michael takes phone] Who is this?
OK. All right.
Can you give us a hint?
Okay.
Does that include 'That's What She Said'?
Really?
Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.
What?
Hey.
Good one.
Three, two, one! [pulls sheet to reveal Christmas tree]
Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else.
Lay it on me.
But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?
I mean, you were gonna do this without me?
You���re the best.
She could put the cup right there.
Roy said that.
Isn't that thing huge?
I thought it was a fun idea.
That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?
I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.
No, I'm not doing that.
Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?
Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn.
You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.
Right.
And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to 'Happy Birthday.' And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.
That's a great idea.
No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.
Oh, um... [A long silence.]
Yes, yes.
No, No, we'll just board that up.  It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.
[on Bluetooth] Testing, testing. Hello, everybody.
[shaking head at the camera]
What'd you get?
[baffled expression]
Um... it's in Maryland.
This one taken? No. Good.
I deserved that.
Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm...
I'm not doing that. I'm just explaining.
I'm really excited to meet your Mom.
Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine's Day.
What?
I think I got it right here.
I ain���t fraid of no ghost. [Pam holds up drawing of a hand with the middle finger raised] Whoa!
All right. I think that went well.
All right. Did he hit you?
What does Level Red mean?
Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we���d save her from Ryan right?
Uh-huh.
No. Thank you, though.
[on phone] I'll take that down right now.
[whistles] That���s a lot of pros.
Nope we're not brothers.
Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?
Oh, no no.
���Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.���
Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim.
No thanks.
Can't believe no ones thought of that.
Andy, you've gotta be kidding me.
Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
I'd hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70's theme party, or a 70's theme meeting, or a 70's theme convention...
Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.
Ok, great.
Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.
Yeah. Right?
The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational. I mean, he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year. Which is probably why this branch will be downsized.
Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?
Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--
Oh, it���s happening!  Let���s just keep it between you and me for right now.
Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that.
[presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]
You mean Kevin?
I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.
We'll look into it.
Michael, don't.
Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman.
Yes?
Yes.
Thanks, thanks Dana.
Went well?
You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.
Which one's this? Perfect.
Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Mmhmm.
[starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn.  Four seconds.
I wouldn���t be too sure about that. Just saying.
If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here: Michael handles more of the 'big-picture' stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...
Okay.
That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
No. I just missed my wife.[Gives Pam a hug and a kiss]
The new guys called one.
Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.
Oh, God.
[while sighing] I suppose I am.
And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.
[chuckles] You got it.
Oh.
No, it- [high-pitched feedback as Jim starts to leave, feedback changes as he moves, turns over the mallard to see the listening devics, sighs, places mallard back on the desk]
What?
Thank you.
Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.
[Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell?
Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.
[confused] What? [Darryl points at his thermos Jim has been using] Oh, man! I'm sorry about that.
[after Pam checks her cell phone] What's going on?
Nnnno.  Uh, turns out, it was just a really bad idea involving fire.  But I think I fixed it.
Well, you're driving, right?
Did you go to second?
Yes, car seat's right there.
This was my decision, not yours.
I'm not gonna eat it.
Nice job everybody. Great work.
No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I���m gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.
Hey.
So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.
Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.
No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-
He's not a part of this. You know that.
Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?
Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo���s here. Let���s do this. Change if you need to.
You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks.
Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...
You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.
Let's start with the wildcard.
Just steer more now.
Kelly!
Who was that?
Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
What are you doing?
Feel better?
Will do. [hangs up] I'll stop calling.
Cool.
Oh, there it is. J1.
What's what?
Bring me players.
I mean... [speechless]
Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs]
You're doin' great, buddy!
Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right.
[Sighs] I'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes.
I missed you.
I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
[reading screenplay] Bullets are flying everywhere.  Ooo, wait, last page, big finish.  Here we go. Agent Michael Scarn kicks open the plane door with a karate chop.
That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.
Stanley?
Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own
Yeah... yep.
Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes.
So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight
How is it my fault?
One.
Just take the parrot.
[gets engagement ring from his pocket] Hey...
All right.
The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
So I guess I'll just... work on my short game.
Hi.
Mm-hmm.
So, none of that tipped you off?
Stop. What?
OK.
How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
We gotta get him.
I bit my lip at lunch today.
But what have you learned about her?
Is that Michael?
Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
Well that's great.  [shakes Ryan's hand] You're talking about your court ordered community service?
Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
I���ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I���d be proud to take.
Nope.
Bye.
Mose has been weird? That���s so unlike him.
Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.
I gotta get out of this dress.
Definitely.
Dwight! At least aim it.
Um...
What?
This is hilarious, but we���re gonna stop with all--
Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.
[walking to his car] Hey, it's me.  It is 5:03.
Hey.
Mmm.
One second 'cause that sounds really good. Is jackass one word or two? [Dwight sighs] One, right? 'Cause, 'cause of the show, it's one.
I just need some time.
I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap!
Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.
Ah...[sees Dwight's wallet and open email] I'm gonna s- [see's Dwight watching from break room]
All you're gonna need to [faking a bad connection] and-  it- and then go to--
Mm-hmm.
Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.
Don't-
Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people.
Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird.
That did. Pretty huge laugh.
You what?
Hey, uh, does Mr. Nortman still teach here? He's a jerk, right?
So how does it work? It���s like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or���
Well there is some bad news.  [accent] There has been another murder.
College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
Easy.
Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
Hey... What?
And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--
Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. [both laugh]
Oh, man. You remember that, huh?
No.
Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
You know what it���s not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.
Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous.
Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.
Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.
117 Mount Bergin St.
Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
What?!
Really?
Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.
[walks in, see's Oscar, Stanley, Creed and Kelly sitting in Michaels office] Okay, I thought I saw people missing.
Hey.
Absolutely.
Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you!
I'm pretty excited about today. I baby-sit Toby's daughter Sasha sometimes. So, she's the coolest kid. She has seen me play with dolls, though, so I don't know how cool she thinks I am.
Still want that.
Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. True���[touches his nose] Oh no.
Si.
[On business call] Yeah.
Thank you.
Yes.
What?
OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
What is that?
So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.
[snickers at Pam's sketch] That is pretty cool.
Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
[looks astonished] Ohhhh!
Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.
It's, okay, it's Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.
Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.
What was that?
Yep.
Mind if I join?
Okay, you know what, Dwight. What if you got a really serious disease like Ebola.
Really?
Another bullets heads towards Agent Michael Scarn, but he jumps out of the plane without a parachute.
Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?
Hey.
...which I guess I'll be taking.
Hey, Dwight. What's up?
Six on seven.
OK. careful, thanks. [takes bullhorn from Andy]
Stop. Dwight, stop.
Yeah, I guess.
Unbelievable.
Thank you.
[getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks.
Oh my God!
Just do it.
Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.
Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night.  So...
No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular.
Yep.
Okay. There���s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.
Shuckin��� the peas. ��You should go back to the first part, though. You are ��gonna ��cover for me?
Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?
Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work.
I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.
We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.
Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just...
Yeah... it.s scary.
Uhhh, the street?
You've seen it, right?
Urkel Grue.
You ready?
Ready?  One, two, three...
What'd you do?
Productivity?  My numbers are good.
How many L to a K?
Hey.
Okay.
Nope, not doing that.
Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal. [in voiceover] I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.
Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.
Not cool. [Dwight still laughing]
Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.
Yes! So when do you start?
Beesley, coffee?
All right. Name.
Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...
I am still in Philly, actually.
I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?
If everyone would like to see proof.
I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.
Uh, hmm. [thinking] Uh, hmm. What else?
So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that���ll print out���Hey. Meet your new desk mate.
No, I don't think I can...
Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
You just came up with that.
Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight...[motions to lobby]
Courtside seats. Sixers.
Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.
I think that's probably all we need to hear from...
Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves]
Sales form for you to sign.
Yep. Cool, man.
Uh hmm, definitely.
Damn it.
Yeah, I���m here. Are we all on?
Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.
We know that.
You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good.
So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word 'Philadelphia'?
I think I did a pretty good job.
You gonna answer it?
Mmm-hmm.
Kev, c'mon.
Five.
Gettin��� psyched up?
Paul Anka.
Good one.
Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.
You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.
Would you like to be our fourth?
No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah.
Um, thank you, Ryan, uh, I don't know, I think I made the mistake one day of telling someone that I like penguins, and here we are.
That���s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
Oh.
Oh! Goal!
Yeah...
Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?
Did you go to first base?
Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor.
Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
Are you alright?
Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!
Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.
Actually here for something else.
Oh, burn.  Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too. [they laugh]
What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.
Boom! [hands Oscar a business card.]
Not gravel, obviously. [both chuckle] No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-
What's that?
Okay. [Pulls desks apart] Just gotta...
...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.
Good, right?  Hello.
Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now?
No.
Mmm-hmm.
No.  They're in the conference room.
That will inevitably lead to mocking. So...
Alright.
That's a guarantee.
No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!
But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.
Go.
You did do it?
Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.
Sorry, Stinky, can���t do it. Too busy.
You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
Aah! Ow!
Call me when you get in. [kisses Pam]
It���s insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I���m stuck here trying to keep him on board.
I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
Okay, let's go.
That doesn't make sense, couldn't be.
Hey.
You shouldn't be talking about that.
I can't.
Hey, David.
Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?
We���ll see. You are an assistant who���s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.
Fine.
Was that your mom?
The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.
Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
I don't know, dad. I don't know.
I think you mean smug
Good.
And you'll be saved.
Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.
Yeah.
I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win.
Are you sure?
Smart.
Just give me one second. I'm just gonna grab something to eat.
Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.
You, too.
Oh, my God.
It's not on your desk.
Just keep him awake.
Okay.
No no no!
So, that's... It's great.
He's a grown man
See ya.
No, fake girlfriends are always wrong.
Like a boyfriend?
You���re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
You should take up a musical instrument.
Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5:00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes.
Three months.
[laughs] I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um... [nods]
Okay, I���ll call you right back.
You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I���m here.
Uh-oh.
[humming]
Yeah. No. Good.
Yeah, alright Kev why don���t you come with us?
[pops back into Jo's doorway] Thanks again by the way.
I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
Pam.
No, you're not reopening the case.  The case is closed.
Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?
[on phone] Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a...
... MICHAEL!
Yeah, I am too.
What's that?
What are you doing?  What, stop...
Was it?
That's okay, I'll do it.
Yeah.
Hmm.
Don't. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!
I must...
Whoo!
We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.
Uh hmm.
Can I change rooms?
[Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah...
[whispering] I don't even know who you are anymore.
You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, I'll just be in, you know. [closes door behind him to supply closet]
What is that? [looks at sign that says 'IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.'] It is your birthday period.
Ahhh.
We have discount prices on ink cartridges...
Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...
Yeah.
What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this.
Okay.
19. [grunts] I had a really hard work out this morning.
You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.
Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.
Nope.
No, you're not.
What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation?
So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...
Of course.
I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.
Shawn Marion.
What?
Yes.
And then you just changed desks, right?
No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.
[answers phone] Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.
Someone's in a bad mood.
We can't figure that out.
The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding.
Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted.
[peering nervously through conference room window] Oh, I don't have anything to say. I'm just hiding from Dwight.
No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five]
I guess. [Pam smiles and walks away, then comes back and kisses Jim on the cheek] How dare you.
It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.
Ransom.
Oh, um. [pulls item from bag and hands to Pam] Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it.
Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up.
You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
Hey.
Hey, how are you?
So what is going on, girl in the computer?
Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
[to camera] Who is this guy? We are killing it.
Everyone knew some of it.
I don't!
You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.
Yeah.
How much time do I have?
That's exactly what Wallace told us.
I don't think so.
No, see? Right there, that���s the problem with your method. ���Cause I still don���t know if you���re saying ���Sea World��� or ���see the world,��� and it���s taking a lot of time to explain it.
Where did you take that?
I���m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You���ve got a regional manager.
You must be out or something.
You took the deal.
Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.
Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.
Yeah.
This is my desk.
You haven't heard our theme, though.
Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker.  And a great number two for the office.
Pam?
Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends.
I'm gonna get a second opinion.
Um, not neccessari...
Andy? You all set?
Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.
Nice.
Show him how to use it.
What are you guys doing?
When did you go there?
Hey Michael.
How are you doing this?
Is that him?
I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp...
[phone] Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.
Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?
[puts fabric softener into cart] ...What?
[on the phone]I can have it to you by the beginning of next week.  Alright? Thanks very much. [hangs up] Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?
Oh.
[Dials cell Phone] And this is Dunder-Mifflin.
Groundhog Day.
And, also, any forms that you are going to need...
Okay, your move.
Bye, Dwight.
Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.'
[impersonating Fonzie]  Ayyyy!
Whoa. You are a volunteer.
No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay [others enter] Hey everybody!
Thanks Janet.
[sitting on a stack of paper] Yeah, well, if you're only free till three on Sunday and I can't get there till one, then it's gonna be pretty tight.
What was my worst first date?  Umm.  It was a couple of years ago.  It was a lunch date, actually, it was right down here, at Cugino's.  And we had just met, and we really hit it off, it was, it was kinda nice.  Umm, huh.  And, uh, then, as it turned out, it wasn't even a date, because she was actually in love with someone else.  So, best first date is also my worst first date.  Oddly enough.
I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.
Yes, nice. Good word association
Hi Katy, nice to meet you.
Thanks.
Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]
Is he OK?
Yeah, definitely didn't need help with that, but, yeah.
Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?
Thank you.
Yeah...
All right.
I don't know, I don't know.
Oh, OK.
Uh hmm.
That's it. Or Mr. Peanut.
[Pam approaches as he sits in his car]  Hey.
There's a table over here.
Yeah. Thank you.
This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?
It's not my favorite...
[laughing] She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.
Okay, okay...
You know what? That's private.
[to camera] Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?
Chicken, hot dog, burger.
Pretty good.
It was --
Now that sounds serious.
OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
I love you.
Whoa whoa whoa!
In well?
Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.
Eww.
He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.
Because it is Halloween. So if you���re going to sing a concert, it���s a good idea to throw that one in.
Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.
Darn it!
I wasn't. But thank you. [to Pam] Do you know anything about this party?
Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.
Oh, I stand corrected.
Oh, I'm so glad you didn't.
That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.
You do?
Oh, one hundred percent.  We all want to see you tattoo your ass.
Wow! Congratulations, that���s a really big step.
Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?
It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out.  We're not going under.
Yeah. [Shot shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse]
Ooh.
Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
I didn't, I'll look somewhere else.
This is Jim.
Oh!
You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.
Oh yeah?
Oh, I can't beat Darryl.
Come on, man.
Topical.
I think you're good.  Doing a good job.
Just tell her the real reason.
Okay.
Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.
[laughs] Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or...
Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it.
I thought you had already... left.
What?
Okay.
Andy, are you all right?
All right. Now I think it's time for you to go.
[whispers] Let me get that for you.
Dragging sticks.
Come on.
It won���t budge.
Why not?
You feel good?
No, we've been dating for six months.
Yeah?
Too late, Kev.
Dwight, should she be our manager?
Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
Alright, here we go!  You're doing great!  She'll be here soon.
OH! [the 'yes she's hot team' claps]
This, man. I can���t do this to Pam.
Well it���s not that easy. It���s kind of sometimes difficult.
I win.
Such a dork.
My god, I���m so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.
Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?
Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?
Oh, OK.
Oh.  He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.
Take care of my wife. I will be back.
[Jim gets down on one knee]
[on phone] Andy?
Oh man, it was great. They were great.
Yup.
No, it's not, because you don't really work here.
Hey Dwight.
Love it.
Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? ���Guten Prank��� number one.
It's not.  It's different.  But it's a good book.
Gotcha. Alright.
A7557962.' Totally nonsense numbers, but you do what you have to do.
Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He���s putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I���ve done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight���only good surprises. ���Guten Pranken���. [chuckles]
Pam?
Yeah. Bye Pam.
Nope.
Still no.
Oh, man, so many points being made.
Wake up. [sprays Dwight]
I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why.  Interesting.
Oh, thanks.
No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone.
So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?
Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs.
Alright, then I will catch you later��� What do we do now?
Okay.
Pretty sure everyone heard that.
That is good. That's it. That's what it is.
You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!
Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.
What? What?
[enters abruptly] Dwight.
We're gonna get him.
No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
Okay, today. 5 o'clock. Closing Ceremonies.
Oh! That was really. [Dwight hits purse against table] This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.
Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody.
Ryan? A little help?
Michael...
One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?
Thank you.
Yeah.
What? [looks in box] Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?
Thank you.
At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.
Perfect!
Yep. [Michael hugs/tackles Jim]
Yeah that's true.
Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.
Really.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Fine.
[explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it's a tradeoff.
But you���re saying there���s a chance.
That seems inconsiderate.
No way. I think she likes this stuff.
What was that?
Again.
Hey, grandma's back.
Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?
I'd go with that.
Hey.
Yeah, uh, well.
Pam, will you marry me?
If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.
No.
Okay.
Let's... eh... see ya.
Total nightmare.
Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?
Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.
Haaank. Is that you?
No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.
What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!
Ooh.
I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!
Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out?
Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?
I didn't... no.
Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.
Nope, that's okay.
Hey, you know what? I got you a cake.
[blows a raspberry, Erin looks shocked, Kevin chuckles]
Oh by the way how's your side project going?
I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.
Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.
Michael, I'm just trying to --
I know.
I've always gotten along well with Toby.  Uh, we're friends.  But I don't think we'll stay in touch necessarily.  I think I'll probably get updates on him from Pam.
Oh!
Got it.
They think it was Mose.
I get it.
Could go either way.
[to Pam] Really?
Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.
Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. [Windows reboot sound] Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?
[sits down next to Denise] So, high school.
I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?
Oh, yeah, so we���ll just do that later.
Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips.
What are you doing?
It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.
Woah, you guys going to lunch?
What?
How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.'
Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally]
Nothing yet.
Yup.
[attempting to move car seat] It's like The Hurt Locker!
OK.
Frank and beans!
You got it.
Your ex-wife?
Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
Alright.
You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?
Hey, Kev.
Hey, how are you?
I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --
Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?
Yikes.
Yeah, people like me I guess.
I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.
Alright Pam, alright [gives her hi-five]. Nice work!
Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. [Everyone talking Phyllis pours Jim some eggnog, as Daryl walks in] Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?
Stop it! It's gonna be great.
But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
De class���.
Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do ���opportunities.���
I am, too. Let me show you.
I think I'm gonna go.
Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something.
I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.
That's what who said?
I think I got a pretty good sense of that one.
Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something?
Cathy wants to leave our clump?
Okay.  Um... Got you something.
You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.
They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now. [crumples up beans, stomps on them, and throws them in a box]
Well, it could happen. Have you ever seen the movie Outbreak?
Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case���let���s get to work.
Dwight, this is crazy.
Hmm... Five.
What?
Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday?
Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  [cell phone rings; Dwight's voice saying 'Idiot, Idiot, Idiot'] Oh, that's my new 'Dwight' ring.
I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?
I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.
Oh, my God. Please.
[hugging Pam] [laughing] Oh my God!
This is gonna be awful.
Yup.  Really great.  When's she available?
No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or...
No problem.
Yes, I���m happy.
Get out.
Why are you- How do you know?
Ok.
Yeah. [chuckles]
[louder] ���Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!���
Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food.  In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food.
Wow, that's a lot of keys.
The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty.
Mmm... I'd prefer to sit in back.
I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
Thanks.
[telephone ringing] [shows note to camera 'It's OK. She'll call back!']
I will. I will.
Agent Michael Scarn.
Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.
On a wing and a prayer, mostly.
Ok...
Alright. Let's get started.
Is Ryan gonna fire me?  I don't know.  I know that I've done everything I can, and I just brought in a huge sale, and... am I insane, or was this kid a temp two years ago?  Because in the three years that he's been here, I think all he's ever done is start a fire and grow a beard.  And it's not even a good beard.
Well, I'm evolving, Pam.
Okay.
That was like, ten years ago.
Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley's face]
Not at all. It should be Dwight.
You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
Don't..
Aw, man.
Nope.
Sorry, man, I can���t focus on zingers. There���s too many potential clients.
Okay.
All right.
Rank each person individually?
Hold on one second.
I just-- what?
Smart. Good. [to Angela] Hey, Angela.
Oh, [points to Cindy] she's asleep.
What?
It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.
We should help him out. [Jim and Pam each take a French fry, eat it, and then look toward the bathroom]
Love you.
Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.
Do you even know what that means?
What is that, like... five pounds?
Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back.
No problem.
Thanks.
Yes!  Angela!  Please...
[whispering] Hey.
...talk about it.
I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- [hears door, hides]
I don't think we have to do this again cause it's gonna take a whole. [everyone clinks glasses]
Uh, my ex-fianc��.
What is it?
Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.
Are you kidding me?  We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
Flowers.
Nope. Can���t accept that job. It���s not a real job.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes���and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that���s���an amazing gift.
I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...
Oh, man, I���d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
I don't know about, love...
Angela.  Nope.  The ashes.
Really?
Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with.
That's right.
Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal.  While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?
Well, we���re here. Perfect. ��[covers sleeping Phyllis with his jacket]
[smiles, looks to Michael]  Really, nothing?
Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.
I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1:15.
I don't know what you mean.
Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.
Nah, you definitely weren���t kidding.  And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. [hands Andy slip of paper]
And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.
Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. [laughs] Oh, text message from my brother. 'Pam cool. Welcome to the family.'
Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
Oh great, I have to cover?
Oh, man. Yeah, I can���t do it.
I can always kind of win at roulette.
One more.  Why are you talking like that?
Are you sure you once knew how to do this?
Too much now.
We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn't do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
What are you doing?
[approaches Roy back at the wedding] There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?
Maybe Stanford would be cool.
I know.
What?
Okay.
There it is.
You have to make the decision.
Ding dong.
Pam.
What? No, no, it's not a vote.
Okay. Sounds good.
Terrible. Totally unconvincing.
Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.
It���s pretty great, right? I mean, we���re coming along��� [to coworker] Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis���s timeline
So this is my life.  Until I win the lottery [laughs].  Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
I promise you, you don���t have to do this for me.
Flooded.
Hey.
That's a common mistake.
Where do I want to go?
[quickly shakes his hands back and forth]
Yeah.
Uh, Ryan can never know.
You don't know what it is.
It's Mose. Who do you think it is?
Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies.'
I guess he can't get any girl he wants.
Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?
True. Meredith.
And that's not the same.
If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.
Six. You?
That's about it, yeah.
Yes.
What's going on?
Yeah, what do you think that's about?
Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit.
I'm trying---
Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one [holds up paper]. Originally given by Benito Mussolini.
So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.
Beesly! Oh, my god.
What brings you to town?
Yup. That's exactly what we did.
Mm-hmm.
I don���t know. He wasn���t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn���t hire his wife.
Can I get a drink?
Do it.
Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try.
I'm not gonna- [cuts himself off, Kevin walks in]
No. No, I'm not gonna-no.
Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer]
That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
Did you murder someone?
Michael.
Careful...  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
Okay.
Alright! Nice job, Oscar!
No. D-
Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, it's totally hypothetical.
This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left.
Looks like a red wire.
I'm not single.
Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.
Dwight!
[in the kitchen] Oh, here's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-
Pam! You can't be serious.
Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?
That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?
And I found out that there's a bus at 5:00 a.m.
Um... let's see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king.
No, Pam.
Ohhh...
Split the difference?
Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.
Nice. [they bump fists]
Robert?
Nice!
You sure?
Hey, thanks a lot.
I knew it, I knew it.
Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
Michael?
Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.
[softly] Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.
I did not see this coming.
Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just��� we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
But you said that you went out with her this weekend.
OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.
Trust me.
You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
Not really a rhyme.
Nothing, just talking.
You can't even do that.
That���s true, yeah.
You could���ve just called that an alliance too, right?
You doing alright, man?
Hey, man.
[watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They've been in there for 45 minutes.
Oh my God.
[Jim moves his head closer and Pam taps him gently in the face] Oh, ok.
Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see?
[reading text] Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.
Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
Did they?
Well, that was quick.
No, that's him.
This is great.
Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong.
Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear.
God!
You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
[phone ringing] You gonna answer that, Kev?
But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.
Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
Hmm.
What?
Whoa.
By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?
[imitating Andy] 'It's not freakin' funny!'
I've spent so much of my life telling myself 'Please, don't end up like Stanley,' and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes.
Go get 'em.
Yeah, it's a golf text.
And in this case...
[to babysitter] So... how do you guys know each other?
Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
Oh, I wouldn't-[clears throat]
Perfect.
That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.
Who goes to business school?
Hey, can you go to IM?
[using black voice] Good afternoon! [Darryl smacks his arm]
What is going on?
Really? You just agreed to that?
This... is the future, because... This is the past. I���ve been through a lot of issues in my life. I���ve seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I���ve been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause]
Did you say 'she?'
Scones.
Dwight, please.
Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?
I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money.
Wow. Are you that bored?
Oh my God.
Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
Whoa! What was that all about.
I'm... leaving on June 8th.
All right, let's run it back.
No.
Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn���t know. Um��� actually I did tell Pam and we decided ���no���. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I���m thinking there���s another conversation coming. And, it���s hard to know when that will be.
Is that... I didn't know that was your... okay, so we're in agreement, this is not ideal... situation.
Is it me, or are we just a little off today?
Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.
Yes.
No.
All right.
That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
Yep. Ah. Oh. [and skinned elbow]
What are you talking about?
OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use [finds a mug] uh, oh -- Snoopy.
Wow. [sees guy at Erin's desk] Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar.
Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.
[clearly just humoring her] No... way!
Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy.
Not as good as you.
Get up.
How long is this? [flips through pages]  Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings.
Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
[after 'the kiss'] You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.
I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.
Wow.  Um, ok. [pops Dwight's orb with scissors]
So why did you come in here?
I love Star Wars as much as the next guy���
That'd be great, thank you. [Erin throws package, it hits Kathy. She thinks it was Jim who threw it]
Yeah. Totally.
Yeah. Even you.
Really?
I���m not wearing eyeliner.
Oh.
And then you go to school for three years.
Michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative.  Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I've ever known.  Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before.
And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.
You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.
What's that cooler?
Mm-hmm.
Now, this is the projection over three months?
No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back.
Uh, no. Nope. Not really.
Oh thanks, Phyllis.
Wait, slow down.
What?
Okay, will do.
Boyfriend.
[gets up to leave room, Michael gestures for him to stay]
New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door���
I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.
[baby voice] Hi.
Oh, just somewhere in the Poconos. I was just surfing.
Hey.
Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second.
About Julie?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.
Aww...
[off camera] Yeah, that's right.
Guys, this isn't some elaborate scam, okay?
Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who���s gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.
Because you���re sitting?
Dwight, it's not a factory at all. Do you have to do what you are doing? [Dwight is tapping each of the bobble heads on his desk and making them bobble]
Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.
Wait.
Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
Michael, come on!
Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?
Absolutely, I do.
Oh boy.
Yeah. That does not feel good.
Bye.
To both these bears.
[looks at a three dollar bill]
He���s got a bank vault. That���s a start.
Where'd you get that?
Right now?
No way.
[walks up to reception] Margaret?
Any luck?
Workspace.
No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?
You know, can I call you back?
Who doesn't?
Kevin Costner.
Michael, did you say anything?
I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?
Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer.
No, you what, seriously, you should have it.
Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?
How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
You're a psychopath.
I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.
Okay, it���s not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.
Six point five days. [winces as Kevin smacks him on the back]
Half hour.
Why don���t you start?
Um, sniper rifle?
Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?
Yeah, well, you know...Cornell.
Good one? [Toby puts on the lens cover and scurries away awkwardly] That's a cool camera.
To waiting.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone.
You didn���t force me.
That���s so great!
Oh! Lots of results.
Yes, you do.
Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?
Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.
that's great.
Oh, my God
[looks shocked] W---Wow. Um. Well... okay.
Is that another motto?
Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
No, he didn't. [Dwight mouthing 'yes, he did']
Nope, not a prank. I think it���s time for you to bury the hatchet.
And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]
No-no-no-no-no.
Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I���m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don���t worry, he���s the best in the biz.
What? [Karen's player shoots Jim's player, 'You killed Jim Halpert' appears on the screen, Karen giggles]
Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
Huh. Well, you know, you can���t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what���s most important. That���s my new thing.
Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?
Haha...
They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]
I don't care.
I don't know. I don't know.
O...K.
[In the parking lot, holding his side, walking to the taxi, Pam follows] Oh...what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. [To taxi driver] One second. Oh...
Ha ha. That's hilarious?
What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!
Well, I work here now.
And that's noon. Exactly. [others groan]
Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.
But I think it���s big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea���.which, by the way, I can���t wait for.
Hey.
Nice.
No.
Ponies.
You gotta have sex with a woman.
Wow. What have we got here?
Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.
Oh, Clark. I���m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.
Well it's just that you had no hair on Friday.
Hey, Andy.
Fine. Party pooper.
He didn't text me.  [Andy's phone chimes]
[on phone] I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
Oooh! You can't handle the truth! [laughs]
All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, that���s-- that���s decorative.
Well, we're really happy.
Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.
But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
Andy.
No, no, no, no, no. No.
Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.
Maybe poison?
No.
Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--
Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Ok, I said average.
What?
It was there when I sat down.
No.
Hey.
Yup.
Microgement.
Brown, shiny, painful bite.
Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?
Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.
Oh-
Sorry about that.
The other volunteers.
What power?
You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?
I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.
Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.
Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?
Big tip.
I... Why would you just say something like that?
Hey, you got a second?
And no one cared.
[on phone] Please don't pick up, please don't pick up, please don't pick up.
What does that mean?
Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question.
What?
Definitely we should.
I'll just go later.
Yeah. Maybe we should both go.
Seems like a nice enough guy.
Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head]
[bounces ball off wall with Toby] So that's what this sound is all day.
OK.
So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.
I'm not talking to you.
Yeah, she's doing really well.
So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
[after a pause] That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.
Hey man, how you doin'? Jim Halpert.
What is happening?
Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here?
Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...
You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?
All right. We'll see. [to camera] No.
Well what if we can't do it quickly.
No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not...
Yeah, we all really...
No, that's not what I-
[as Pam has another contraction]  Oh!  Oh, alright.  That's a good one.
Are you serious?  Pam.
Oh, uh, no. Could-
Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.
I know.  I suck.
Yeah, he's definitely something.
Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now.  Totally.
OK.
Oh, I didn���t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier.
I will do some research.
Co-managing is a give and take.  You have to pick your battles.  One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them.  He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.
Uh, I can't get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can't...
The ocean.
A little bit. ... Worth it.
Thanks, Kev.  I'm good though.
Strongly-painted picture.
Yeah?  ...  Oh.
Well, I'm going the speed limit. So...
Great.  See you upstairs.
We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.
A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?
No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I���m not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody.
We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on.
[over phone] And Dwight.
Yeah I couldn't cut it down.
That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
I am not kidding. [shows camera an engagement ring] Got it a week after we started dating.
It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird.
Ok.
Well, maybe you should get back to work.
[talking on phone] You sound tired. Everything ok?
Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because...
[takes her hand] Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, you're so pretty.
[Windows reboot sound] Dwight, want an Altoid?
Right... That's good.
What?
Or a gong.
[Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
[Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop.
You come so prepared. Aspirin.
Okay! First of all, stop using my name.  And second of all-
Yep.
Mmm, that's where you're wrong.  I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require.  So, I think we should go get some.  Now, please.
And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, he's the drummer and the singer.
The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn?
You ok?
Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don't worry about it.
Hey David.
How's it going?
I am not lying.
You want to just make a run for it?
Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?
Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try.
Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work.
Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?
Tom Cruise!
Hello?
All right.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.
Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.
fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,
Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything.
See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.  It's-
It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ...
Guys, the Afghanistananies.
[ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?
���Together we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh.���
Wait, when was this?
Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.
Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
It's the lever on the side.
What are you talking about? You're not the boss. Andy is. Andy?
Great, yeah, good.
Oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though.
Right.
Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
Yes! Phyllis! [claps] Phyllis, just put your foot right through here [lifts strap on box of paper]. Right through the flonk.
Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing]
Who?
Gotcha.
Which would be me.
You have a cell phone charger.
Yeah.
Hey.
You got it, you're so close!
Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding.
[walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] 'Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.' [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!
Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.
Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
Hey. [Andy pushes things aside and sits on top of Jim���s desk, kicking things in the process.]
[Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing, Jim imitates her] Can I do something for ya?
Okay, so we're good.
There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
No, no, you won't do that. Nope.
Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.
Yeah. [chanting] Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!
Competent.
So.
I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?
���And shove it up my butt.���
I know.
Co-manager, actually.
And you should.
That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag...[looks up to ceiling where there is a red tape X over Dwight's chair] Oh my god.
Yikes. [everyone gasps]
Uh-huh.
Nothing.
Yeah, right. I mean, unless they���re willing to pass some tests.
Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped.
It���s Okay.
Now he is saying 'Hi' louder.
All right, well it already went through, so...
we good?
Do you run the bed and breakfest?
Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then... [reading text message] 'How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight.'
Pull up your pants.
Robert.
Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.
Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
Anything. You got it.
Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
Alright. [Andy rolls back]
Oh, yeah.  Don't worry about it.
...Okay.
Those flowers are nice.
So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume.  And a moustache.
All right.
Stop!
No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.
Hey, Darryl. [whispers in his ear]
Tour, let's do the tour first.
Doesn't matter what the name is. Se��or Loadenstein, that's stupid.
You wanna do this?
Hey!
[Walks back into The Office] Yep, I did say that.
I forgot if there was an 'e' between the 'l' and the 'y.' I still don't know.
No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'.
Okay.
There's the charm.
Ok. Bye.
Unfair. When���s my birthday?
Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! It's Phyllis!
We've been through this.
Sure, yeah. [laughs] Hollywood. [Ryan Howard pulls out 3 thick scripts] Alright.
Alright.  I'll tell everybody here that you say hi.
Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It���s really great.
Why?
Not your birthday.
Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me
Too, too loud. Too Loud.
Yup, I guess so.
I don't know. [looks at Stanley, who took his mug and is drinking out of it] Oh! That's... not... yours.
I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.
There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
I...  Pam, please.
Well guys with girlfriends don't.
Yeah?
Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-
[after entering daycare] Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.
Hello? [laughs] No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK. [punches button on phone]
Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually.  But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers.
Are we in danger?
All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.
OK. [Meredith leaves]
Okay, I'll just go get the other guy.
No, I didn't. [Michael laughs] You know why?
Oh, I'm engaged to Pam.
Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it.
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Oh it has losers.
Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um��� I don���t know how to tell you this, but��� we have a little bit of a problem.
Great. See ya' then.
Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?
Sally.
I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80's movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I don't do that, I think I'll be alright.
No way.
Think you can let go?
Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?
[approaching Reception] Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?
I think you should do it. That's great!
OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.
Okay.
That's not the point.
Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...
I don't like that.
[flicks football onto Kevin's desk] OH!
Okay, sorry, sorry.
No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.
Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
Kelly, you know what...
What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.
[Michael steals the ball] Yeah, Michael. Go Michael. [makes shot]
Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.
I think Stanley just coughed.
Stop shoving me.
Yes?
But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.
Good luck. [closes door and locks it]
You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager.
[to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  He's winning.  I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.
[taking away Dwight���s handset] Go ahead David, I���m listening.
To madness.
That's nice.
[pushes Dwight's finger away] Just, easy.
It is totally insane.
Porque es muy rapido.
Well, what if I just do this?
[leave the conference room to address everyone]
Um, just for the day while Michael's at my desk.
You are really good at modesty. She���s a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kids��� room. There���s a hippo leading a parade of 500 children���
You know, at the end of the day, it���s really only two days. I mean, I���ll be back in the office. ��If you need me for an emergency, call me. ��I���ll be there...
For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here...
Wow, simultaneous sale.
Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
What do we got?
Did something happen Dwight?
Oh.
All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]
Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.
I���ll call you when I get there.
Okay, this is the second time in two days that the website isn't working.  Do you guys know anything about it?
I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody.
Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  We'll be fine.
How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.
Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.
Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
Alright.
I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. [holds up same book] I've only sold one copy.
Oh, no.
Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.
I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.
Let the games begin. [sings Olympic theme]
No.
Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.
We���ll talk tomorrow?
All right.
Yep.
What's going on?
Alright, well, we're never leaving the house again.
Yeah.
Where do you want to go for dinner?
[sings] Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,
How do you hate it? It's a cake.
Sure.
I was very drunk.
Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.
What?
No, you chose yourself.
Oh. Um���
Good. Good.
Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.
Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
He's a volunteer.
Hmm. Doubt it.
Really?
I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork.
No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal.
[To Dwight] So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?
Are you interested in her?
A toast, better make it good.  To avoiding a class two felony charge.
Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-
Hmm?
I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
Um...
No, really, what���s going on?
[raises hand] Are you stoned?
Stop.
No... I think it's a great idea.
Hey.
Nobody.
Andy revealed himself to be a double agent.  At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent.  And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent.  Oh, and it is 6:00.
Great work Dwight.
We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.
Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.
What's that?
He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash.
Pam, I'm scared.  I'm real scared.
And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.  [everyone claps and makes comments]
But that would make more sense. [Pam sighs]
You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
Okay, you know what?  You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.
Nope. Different movie.
Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.
Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?
Okay, you could just say you don't know what's going on.
It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?
Dwight! [pushes Dwight's hands away] Why?
We'll figure it out.
Easy.
Uh-huh.
In Philly, so, that doesn���t really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.
Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.
Oh, I didn't know you knew her?
Hey.
Oh yeah?
Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.
Really?
You know, try sending them another invoice.
Prank! [throws money from Dwight���s wallet on the floor]
Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?
Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.
He's not a real candidate.
Yeah, why did you?
No politics?
What?
Yeah, I gotta call out on that.
This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
Yes.
What are you doing?
Dwight, come o-
Love.
Yes?
Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who���s the strongest? Well, there���s only one way to solve that ��� flat curl contest.
[Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?
Ok, say please.
Hey, how's it going?
Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so...
Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?
You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
I���m taking some time off from work���well, my other work���because we needed it.
Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
[hushed voice] Uh yeah. Trust me, I���d rather be with you guys.
Ok, you're on.
Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking...
Just all the - drama.
Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that.
It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?
Wow, that sounds pretty cool.
Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
Sure.
Great!
No.
[to Michael] Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.
Who's gonna see us?
Hey.
What I���m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I���ve ever said.
Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.
Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?
Oh?
What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?
What's that?
All right.
Hey.
Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!
Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?
Mm-hm
What?
God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]
By the way, man, this place is... beautiful.
About ten minutes.
Hey!
Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some fire crackers and they start popping]
Alright.
My God!
What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?
Who will be watching the children?
Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-
Excellent. Go for it.
Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open.
Please stop.
Oh.
Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam.
Give the bottle to Michael [sprays Dwight]
I got this. [taking Katy's bag from Michael]
���..breast pain...���
I have nothing in common with Plop.
Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
What?
And then compare.
You did not know it.
Is there some evidence?
It's really good to see you, man.
Dwight, question.
It's my own fault-
So, what is this special project?
And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
Umm...
You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.
Yes, absolutely.
Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?
I need you to breathe in my face right now.
You're not going to freak out?
Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who���s excited?
Stanley. Uhh��� you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
Meredith Van Helsing?
I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.
Four months.
Well, is that it? Or?
I���m sure he���s just nervous.
Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?
In the fridge.
No, not without a 'please.'
Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.
Hey Helen. Is everything ok?
Well, it's good to see Kelly's maturing.
Can I address that?
What?
That's-
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?
Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.
Today's a big day.  Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  It's got shag carpets.  I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting]  She's gonna love it.  Right?
So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one.
Stop, stop, stop.
Really?
Okay... [puts pizza into Dwight's mouth]
Okay.
Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind.
And... ta da.
What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.
Really?  Do you wanna get back to that?  I could go.  I should go.
I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?
Yikes.
Hey, Dwight.
Nothing.
Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
All right, all right. Okay.
Goggles?
Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.
Oh, my God. Are you serious?
You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.
Alright, let's get this started.  I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.
OK, great.
That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.
Nice job, Beesly.
Tickets are 250 bucks.
You have a walking buddy.
I���m really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?
Okay.
[As he's walking out] That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!
She knew it.
Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?
That's what I thought.
Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I'm gonna need four. [kisses Pam]
Oh, there's no game.  We're just trying to get these chips for Karen.
Here we go.
Oops. [hangs up]
I'm alright.
Jackpot.
[noticing that everyone is giving him a sympathetic look] How does everyone know already?
Wasn't it...  It's kinda like a...  Like that.
That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...
That's it.
Well, the joke was on you.
You know he's doing all this on purpose.
Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.
[to the buyer] Hold on a second. [to Pam] The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about���
[over phone] What?
It wasn't me.
A wooden duck?
I've had a Foreman grill for about six years, I've done about 85% of my cooking on it, but I've never burnt myself, probably because I don't use it as a pillow.
Dwight!
[to Pam] A banana?
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?
I know.
Umm, hmm.
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
You okay?
Definitely not. That's disgusting.
Um... why Kelly?
And to drink?
Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier.
Oh, great. So we���ll see somebody else���s kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it���s really not that hard to film a video.
OK.
So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?
[to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.
I really don't know how it happened, David.
Hey, how's it goin'?
Right.
Is that off again?
Sure glad you're back.
Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood.
Ok...that's not...
Love you too. [hangs up phone, Pam sits on a bench crying]
Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.
You... owe me.
Oh, you want me to be you?
Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, ' You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.'
Yeah, we did. Hey, how long���how long do we think that���s gonna take?
Your department's just you, right?
Oh.
Didn't I?
Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]
Yeah, I never even knew that part of the office existed. [Pam chuckles] Hey, who's that guy? [Jim points to Stanley]
Alright, let me turn on some music.
Thank you. You know what, screw this! [pulls Pam into a big smooch]
[standing outside, dials Dwight's cell phone]
Hey, uh David.
[waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?
Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don���t listen to it at all because we���re at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so���
Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.
Still decorative.
[whispers to Pam] Shel Silverstein.
Nice.
My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this.
No, she's not.
Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.
Oh yeah, yeah... hope that's okay.
Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?
Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...
I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too.
I don't know about Stephen King, I mean...
Animation? All her by the way. [points at Pam]
[enters] Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They���re going to make you pay for the fish, and��� they wanted to know when you can start.
Yep.
Thank you.
Hold on, hold on. Is this him?
Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.
Not now, Toby, my God!
It's not hilarious, but...
Morning!
Seriously?
You called any headhunters?
Ah, you know me too well.
Pink is the red-
Okay. Thank you.
And a man.
Yep.
Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office]
[Jim's phone goes to voicemail] This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.
Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  I'll talk to them.
So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.
Very cute. [holds out the phone]
Ok, sure. Will do.
You ready?
I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.
Uh, I heard it.
I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.
Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?
[to camera] It's going really well, actually.
Wow.
Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor?  Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages?  That'd be great.
Okay, maybe we should talk specifics.
Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That's it.
Ah, dinner.  Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.
Michael, Dwight would like your man meat.
When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?
You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...
For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin���
Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?
Just...you good?
Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it.
Yeah.
Gimme a break.
Oh, great. [reads] 'Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy.' Oh that's not good.
So, really, you're just calling her?
Oh, uh, later-ish.
Pam, Pam, it's time.  Let's go to the hospital.
I think it'll take you a little longer than that.
Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.
Everything is going to be ok.
Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, 'I don't own an Ebay store,' so...
Hey, you don't have to...
Because we���re friends.
This is all we have.
Absolutely, will do.
[Creed takes toy from toy drive box.] Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy
Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry.
[cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.
Well, you were surprisingly restrained.
You cannot take the fall for him.
[leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen]
No.
You know, that's probably not gonna last too long, you should go to a hospital and get a real cast.
I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.
What, seriously? What is she saying?
Cranford?  No.  We will never watch that.
That's actually a good idea.  We'll all take a brief intermission. [To Pam]  Hey, are you hungry?
You have no idea.
Pam!  You don't think he'll mind if we take the shampoo, do you? [holds up large bottle]
She's wearing a onesie [holds out his cell phone, Oscar leans in but Kelly grabs his arm]
Okay.
For a lot of reasons.
Really?
Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.
Okay, just talk.
Another round, boys? Great. [Jim walks to the bar]
Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.
That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it's a murder.
No, I don't.
In this car?
If you could help me out, that would be���
Oh!  See I'm here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
I'm just gonna write 'held back tears.'
Pretty amazing.
Ok, Roy?
Hmm, what?
Done. Explain.
Definitely Grandma.
Is this a bad time to be doing this?
No.
Chapter 9 ��� The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.
You weren���t there.
How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?
What are you talking about?
Love that one.
[on the phone]and I���m back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?
No, thanks.
Oh, okay.
And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?
Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... [Ryan walks in]
Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.
What?
No.
Well, that is because that is the gift that keeps on giving. Oh, my God. I left today's paper on my desk.
Okay.
Yep.  [Maguire keeps swinging]
Ok, so promise that you'll wait till we leave the parking lot before you go to the bar.
What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
What's up, Hef?
[imitating game announcer] You win. [Darryl throws empty can on floor] How good did that feel?
Right.
[Pam starts nodding in agreement] Why are you nodding?
Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.
But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.
There���s a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.
I���ve been in here for 20 seconds.
Yeah. You're right.
[long pause] Huh. This is a little out of left field.
Yeah.
Ready?
See you later.
Yeah, no, I don't think you can.
Weeknights are actually tough just because���
What happened to 'Do Not Mock'?
Okay.
No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done.
I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...
Nice.  That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.
[on phone]: Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ...
So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.
I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video.  I knew we'd need a back-up plan.  The boat was actually Plan C.  The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago.  Pretty much the day I met her.
No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!
Exactly. It happened in Big.
All right.
Tonight, hopefully.
[partially blown up balloons on table and hanging from streamers] Are you kidding?
No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place.
Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now.
Michael, no...
[laughs]
You haven't done any of the research.
What?
I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!
Was in the green group.
OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... [Pam starts laughing]... spy on our other branch. No no no.
OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later. [hangs up]  That was a good story.
That's awesome.
Thanks.
[as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.
Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  I'm glad.  Any real potential there Beesley?
That���s funny.  Ok.
Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.
Then why the question?
That's what I want.
And then we checked the fax machine.
So...
Yeah
One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
Nice job, man.
How's that gonna help you?
Yes. Right now? Yes.
Yeah. Yeah. It���s a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to...
Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep.
Couple of times.
Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-... [Jim bites his lip]
Tuna?
[shakes Michael's hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
No, Michael.  I'm not leaving the car.
Great!
You wanna pull a prank on Andy?
Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.
Yeah. You have fun?
What?
Toby.
Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly?
Nope. OK.
You gotta be kidding me.
Um, this one interesting the power comes from the font in this one. 'Schrute Space,' very medieval, very England. Um, this one's forceful, this one's very Dwight. 'Quiet! Dwight Schrute Working,' it's good.
Yeah. ��Thank you. Thank you.
I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?
Right back at ya.
...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but...
Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.
Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
Whoa, careful, careful.
Wait wait wait, who said that?
So, next interview has to be better.
How do you know it was me?
[gives Dwight a thumbs-up - mouths the word] Good.
I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.
Aww.
Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
Come on.
No.
Wow. What kind of bike is that?
OK, thank you for ... this.
Puerto Rico was awesome.
Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--
Did you just change it to Gollum?
Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
Uh, yeah, I guess.
Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.
Oh, would you look at that.
Oh, also, while you���re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.
I don't think so.
Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.
[behind Dwight]: OK.
Oh, crap. Were those yours?
Ding dong.
Hi.
...It's something to think about.
Okay, what was this look? [Oscar does the look.]
Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we���re scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix ��� me asking the boss of the company I���m abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash.  So��� problem solved. Thanks, guys.
I think she's okay.
And of course, classy.
Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.
You will?  Wanna do it right now?
No. It's cool.
So, how you holdin' up?
Good advice Beesley.  Thanks.  See you out there.
It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or...
Right?
Who doesn't love that?
Michael...
What happened, did he do it?
Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic.
[on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.
Oh, god, nature, please.
Those are like my favorite movies. I didn't really think you could win Desert Island, but I think you just did.
Oh, don't be that person.
Michael, we only told our parents last week.
Copy that.
Maybe put up some shelves.
Hey.  What's up?
That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
You've got something on your nose.
Alright, my turn.
No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right.
Here they come.
Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?
I'm sorry.  She scares me. [walks away, Pam keeps eating]
...Right. Spin-serve! [serves, and Dwight scores]
Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?
What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.
What are we doing?
Do you really have to do that right now?
[over phone] What?
Who wants Phyllis as Santa? [most everyone raises their hand]
Sure!
Come on, Gabe, you can���t handle his hamstrings. You���re getting hypno-thigh-zed.
Uh... Not a bad day.
[holding up a sign that reads, 'Dwight picked the wrong day to put a wooden mallard in my office']
How are you, man?
Sure.  Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-
Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
Sure you don't want the teapot?
What kind of pizza would you like?
I thought it'd be funny.
I���ll take five.
Like hypothetically��� if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.
Okay.
[Pam lights a candle] Wow.
Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight...
Oh. You don't have to tell me this.
Hey... [Roy lunges towards Jim]
No.
And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
Actually, I have the certification number right here.
Fair enough.
Well... that's not gonna hold up in court.
Where is it?
You didn't set up your BlackBerry, Dwight?
We need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
Michael.
Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool.
No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.
I'll take it.
How much weight have you lost, Dwight?
No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...
Alright.
A really awesome baby.
I know.
Okay.
That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
What's up?
That's cool.
[Michael has a 'sticky-hand' toy and snags a paper off Jim's desk and then laughs] About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.
Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.
You heard that one.
But I know how to spell it.
Alright...  Hey, did you change?
Oh, nothing.
So I guess I can't get up.
Oh boy...
No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.
She's engaged, um... to me.
For the North.
So, the situation is the worst.
15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?
Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.
Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?
Hey New York, Happy Halloween!
Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.
Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey.
I'm sorry.
65. Ok, no need to laugh.
Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
[overhears loud monster noises] Its Monster dot com.  Singular.
What?
[to Cece] Hi. [to everyone] All right. Travel safe, Angela.
Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.
Okay.
Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?
[mouths] C'mon!
Missed the last part.
Right.
Eight months?
[exhales loudly] Andy...
Sounds complicated.
No, I don't.
I'm gonna write you up for not working.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.
Thank you.
Yes, they do.
Alright.
Wow, that���s���
Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing.
Right? [laughs]
Is there a limit?
Cute, sure, yeah.
That sounds terrible.
I'm gonna grab her, okay.
Till Death Do Us Rock.'
Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
Thank you.
I mean, it's just that- [clears throat] You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you...
Michael's birthday. It's pretty fun to watch, actually. He gets very excited, and then he eats a lot of cake. And then he runs around the office. Then he has a sugar crash in the afternoon. And then he falls asleep. And that's when we get our work done.
That's also not true.
Hey Meredith, how you feelin'?
I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.
[to Dwight] What are you standing for?
Well, there's got to be an explanation.
I mean, do you like it? You having fun? [Andy snorts, unsure how to answer] Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun���.and you did that.
Ok, he didn't fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.
Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?! [Kelly and Erin screaming as Dwight bashes their heads together, everyone attacking each other and yelling]
Hey! What the hell's goin' on?
You're definitely hoarding this by the way.
It's fine.
No, because of the promotion.
Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?
It's a lunch thing.
Ooh, what about, uh,  Dwight's dojo?
OOH! Boom! Face!
Nope.
You can try. That, that might work.
I'm gonna say fifty.
What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?
Great.
He just sent a text...
Catching butterflies.
[on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled?
Oh no, that would be great.
Well, he's Florida's problem now.
Okay, wait, wait.
Did that
Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right?
OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.
Uh-huh.
And how many would you like?
No, don't push.  Pull.  Pull.
Oh yeah, how long's this meeting going to last?  [Stanley mumbles, looking at his watch]
I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.
So... how 'bout let's not?
Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?
You all right?
Showtime!
[conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
You're an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-
What is happening right now?
I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
Wow.
Oh boy.
Michael, not now.
We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders.
No.
Wow.
Wait, what?
Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans!
Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.
I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.
The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says 'You wanted me' enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.
Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert���s notebook.
Night-night.
You���re welcome.
Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
It's not even real yet. And I'm not gonna tell her 'til it's real.
Who's they?
Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah.
Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever.
But, what if?
Wait, you alright?
Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.
[shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.
What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone.
I'll take it.
Oh you did?
I���m doing this just for me? Is that what I���m doing? I���m doing it just for me. If that���s what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?
Uh, by the way. Have you heard Dwight say the word immunity, yet? Because if I can get Dwight to say the word immunity, it might be the greatest day of my life.
Ok.
For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.
That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
Well, I promise you that has nothing to do with it.
I promise you, we don���t need a warning-
Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.
Yeah.
You know what?  Let's go.  We got to go to the hospital.
[gives Dwight a high five] Great.
Okay.
Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.
Sounds like every other party.
Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.
That's all right.
Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
Uh-
I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I���m helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I���ve ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong.
All right.
Because you���re sitting?
What do you think of Kelly?
You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?
When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.
Okay.
What did I write?
First of all, hi.
And you didn't fail those things either.
Stop! Stop!
So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-
No, it's bad. Darryl canceled go-karting....
Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings.  Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.
Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain.
Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.
A what?
I'm on minute six of this message.
We should just go. He's really uncomfortable.
Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.
That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.
Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.
Here's the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because they're set up to do that kind of thing.
[Group chants along] Pie! Pie! Pie!
And I'm telling you, I don't.
No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California��� for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.�� He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don���t really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.���� And he chose���
Hey, do you have a second?
Ok, where is he?
I remember that.
Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
Five tickets on the windshield...  Hey.
Oh, no, no. No.
[approaching Michael] You have to stop this.
I am.
I think I know the problem.
What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?
[to Dwight] Are you serious?
Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!
Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.
Well I do.
Dwight!
Jim Halpert.
[swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine?
Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied.
Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.
Oh yeah-
Nothing.
Yep...
Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.
Yeah.
Yeah, trying to quit though.
Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal.
Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.
Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... .
We could put that in orange juice.
No. What party?
We were just kids.  What did we know?
So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.
Nope.
Wow. [heads toward the conference room]
But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
Ah. You brought in your doll collection.
Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just...
Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
Stanley, are you listening to music?
What award would you like to give Dwight?
[glances at Pam] Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.
To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle.
Hey.
...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
Hmm���Heda. [alert] No.
Uh, what does -- what does that mean?
Pam, it wasn't her.
Toby and I used to sit together until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much.
Dwight. Dwight.
You all right?
[Windows reboot sound] Mint Dwight?
No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What���s up?
I just want it to stop.
Yeah.  Kinda feel bad for her though.
Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?
How are things?
What are you doing?
Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we don't need a new system though.  Happy with ours.
- two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.
Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win.
An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?
[reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters.
Okay. Phyllis.
Stop. I'm a barista in your fantasy?
Mmm-hmm.
Goodnight, Michael.
OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?
[addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you.
See ya.
Good.
Ok.
I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.
Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
Hey.
No way, a 280?
What's up, Meredith?
What? Pam!
What?
Spot on.
Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?
Hey uh, Michael.  Don't jump on the bouncy castle.  You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured.
[emerging from the Men's room] Empty.
I can.
I don't know. Let's break up.
I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.
What kind of car does she drive?
And that isn't weird?
Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
Really was.
Yep.
And I don't support her choice to hit you.
I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?
Great.
Okay... [changes back to Glee]
Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--
[over phone] What?
Hey.
What was that?
Can't do that.
Okay, guys, guys, guys. That almost sounded like business, and we are trying to focus here today, okay?
Pam, it just happened.
[cell phone rings] Excuse me, one second. Hi.
[whispering to Pam] Let���s go outside
Hey Karen.
All right, good catch-up.
Yeah.
So let's have it at the hospital.
Just then, Agent Chang gets a bullet in the head.
Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
Uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'Cause otherwise we can't do any work.
Really...
Nothing much.  Let me ask you something.  It's actually little awkward.
Pop-up?
Yikes.
Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping]
Oh, [clearing throat, deeper voice] Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh...
Doesn't matter.
Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. [To Pam] Hey! How are you?
Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton.
[driving] I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should. [sighs]
Does the Department of Health know about this?
[Turns off Dwight's music] Whether it's this time or next time.
I'll do it.
Here you go. [throws it over glass]
Let me guess, you think you should get it.
That doesn't matter.
It���s great.
We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It���s like everything I did, he just wouldn���t go for it.
All right, you know what? [picks Pam up and carries her off the court] Let's do this.
If I didn���t do certain things without telling Pam, she���d be married to Roy. [chuckles]
Exactly. You can do this.
Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.
Yeah, I'd say she's happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8:00 AM.
Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her.
Okay, here's uh, this is very simple. 'Dwight's Workspace,' nice.
[A note is on Jim's computer that says, 'It is time. Parking lot at noon.' Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]
Are they looking at me?
Hey, Kelly, it's Jim.
[Philip is crying] I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?
Okay.
Oh, so that's it?
Oh, hello Mater. Good news: I've married. Tell Fater. [hangs up] Such a nice woman.
What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
Okay.
Okay, done.
Hey.
Oh yeah? What's the first best?
I'm going home, and I'm taking my baby with me.
Okay.
How would that work in well?  I just want to know.
I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out.
And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green.'
John Dillinger.
Hey dude, you know what a 'rundown' is?
I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That���s it. You look really, really good.
Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.
We'll see.  I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.
Ok.
[walks quickly to break room, opens cabinet and finds mugs of Oscar, Creed and Phyllis]
Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I���m not looking south, I���m not livin���.  That���s what I always say.
Yeah.
Oh, great.
Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.
I'm Jim, by the way.
And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.
Hey, who'd you end up hiring?
Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.
Okay.
Well...
Oh yeah?
It just feels a little bit, like...
So what's your strategy for this race?
Fantastic.
Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.
Let's do it, shoot it.
Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?
Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight.
Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend.
I didn't sign anything.
Nope.
Well, I think she has a kid.
[to Pam on floor] Nice effort.
Okay alright. [gets up] I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.
You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?
The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!
Oh... lets take the tour Pam.
Uh��� yeah, I'm just watching basketball.
Ooh! Are you nuts?
What's going on?
Is he you?
What is that?
What do you call it? Schruteball?
Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?
How much time do you have left on your break?
Yeah... maybe.
Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.
Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.
[dictating to Pam] Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
Why won't more people do that? [laughs]
I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name.
You really want to do this?
Dead goose.
Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
Oh, yeah.
I... why don't we go back to this animation.
[laughing] He's alright.
Got it.
OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.
Yeah?
Penny for your thoughts.
No.
Why's it smell real? [Pam shows him a hidden car-freshener] Ah... good one.
What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life.
Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?
Bye. ��[pause] Yep. See, you���ve still got to press ���End,��� Pam.
Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that it's Friday.  And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.
We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?
What'd you do, Prison Mike?
Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.
Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like.
Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --
But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.
Are you serious?
Congratulations.
I'm irate right now.
Are you serious?
What? Yes, that is exactly what I mean. Wow. You are very good at what you do.
You know what? Let me take Roy.
I'm coming.
Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.
The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs]
I haven���t heard of it, obviously. But I���m out because I am significantly younger than you-
Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work.
Ooh!
Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?
Let���s hear it.
Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.
Yeah, yeah. Exactly.
You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
Oh do you mean when I get the job?
Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---
I gotta go do this.
The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.
Dave.
Thanks man.
[to Pam] ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good.
Okay, bye. [Jim turns back to Julius] So sorry about that.
Just cut through it, man, it's no big deal.
Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, 'For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?' and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
He does?
I uh, I have some ideas, actually...
It is. Big time.
We would really appreciate it.
[laughs] Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.
And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand. [Michael, then Dwight raises hand]  Can I get you some punch?
Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.
See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you.
Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here.
Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
So, you just couldn't take it anymore, huh?
Look at that form.
Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.
Oh, I actually talked to my wife and we���d really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor.
[notices cleaning crew coming up to the gate] Cleaning people. Oscar. [everyone starts to walk outside] OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us.
[whispering] Would you please stop that?
[dancing with Pam. They kiss] See, now you don���t owe me anything.
Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?
And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.
Wow. Win-Win.
What?
If you want to come back then, that'll be fine.
We gotta get someone else in there right now.
Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.
Okay. [IM chiming] [laughing]
No. Michael. Michael.
That's awesome.
Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.
I'm good. How you doing?
You���re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh���
Yeah. I'm definitely going.
All right. And cider.
Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises.
...and finds the... fake grail? No grail?
OK, here we go... Digest of business terms, CliffsNotes on business economics, and a sales encyclopedia.
No I'm not drunk.  Are you drunk?
DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island?  Yes! Meredith?
Don't do that.
Or zipadeedoodaah.
So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.
[In Kitchen] We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.
Exactly.
No.  You got that backwards.
Yeah.
Hello?
Ok...
Oh my God!
And impressions!
Why don't we just go by ourselves?
It has been, yeah.
A formal warning... [chuckles]
Hey.
Really? Wow... that's bad.
Hmm...
I'm not-
Who's that?
Wow.
This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
Thank you.
Killer nanorobots?
If this doomsday device goes off...
Michael.
Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.
Oh.  Two kisses.
That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?
This is dangerous.
Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better.  I only slack off when things are good.
Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole 'Woody came to life' thing so quickly?
Okay.
You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.
Well, your office is behind you.
Okay, they're fine. They're adults.
No. I can't. It was like, hours ago.
It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming.  But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel.  I just can't grab onto him.  It's infuriating.
There is no inner circle.  Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.
[trying to hide from Michael what they're doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]
Just like that.
That's OK, we're good.
No.
Wow.
We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together.
Mm-hmm.
I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.
Okay, Andy, we need to go. Seriously.
Yes.
Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.
Nope. No.
Okay.
Yeah.
Can't you do something about this?
Oh my God! You are so drunk!
Sure we'll go.
And that's all?
Be honest.
[quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.
I can see that.
It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.'
It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.
Okay, listen.
How do you feel?
Okay, this was pretty simple-
That's pretty good.
All right. [laughs] Awesome. Cool.
Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?
...Okay I can't... help you... with that.
Yes.
Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.
Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred.
Dwight and I are both writing letters to our clients. I'm just sending a quick note to say how much I appreciate their business, and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation. It's just... different styles.
Let's take a look. Nice.
What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but...
Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I���m gone.
Oh!
What about Oscar? Could you beat Oscar?
What about you?
Dwight tried to kiss me.
Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.
[nervously] Pretty good.
My name is Jim Halpert and I am a sales rep, which is a very important job. Um, without me dozens literally dozens of small businesses would go paperless.  They would have to write on their hands, or bed sheets, or who knows you know. Total chaos, total chaos. I mean or they could get their paper somewhere else. Staples maybe. I don't know.
No.
Yeah.
OK, I'm going back to work.
You're not having sex.
I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball.  Oh, how much?
[Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.
You follow him on Twitter?
Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we? [Dwight's phone rings. He crawls into nook under Jim's Quad-Desk]
Yeah, yeah.
[seeing Cece gone from the couch he left her] Uh, MeeMaw, where's Cece?
Yeah, I know.
I'm a drunk driver.
No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.
You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.
Prove it.
Ah.
No, you're making this up!
Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-
What?
Ooh, go easy with the shaking.
Sure, what's up?
That is a lie, that is a lie.
Mm!
Alright. So, tell me all about it.
You're welcome.
All right. You know what? ��Maybe we���ll just... We���ll go slow.
I can't. I just got a manicure.
Wow. I think you're bluffing.
Good to see you.
[on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.
I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it]
Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
OK, I think I can help here.
Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands]
Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.
Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!
Yup. That's perfect.
Ok. Good talk.
I can���t. I have the thing.
But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.
[closes folder] You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?
No I'm not.
[pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] 'Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.'
And what happens here is-
Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone.
Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen.
Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away 'Survival Skills' and 'Self-defense.'
Six dollars.
Too loud.
That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
[holds up an ASCII image of Dwight]
Is-
Justin Timberlake?
Okay.
There's a little more to it.
My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with.'
[holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound]
Pam, I couldn���t get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.
That sounds bad.
Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.
I���m sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment.
[on the phone] Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.
[holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe.
I'm not writing, 'Horse Hunt.' I don't even know what that means.
It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.
What did he say?
Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.
I���m sure you did not. What was your question?
cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in --
[Dwight imitates the 'Jim face'] Look at that.
Okay, what?
Pam and I are good buddies.  I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.
Oh, the best.
[stammers] I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.
Yep.
That's a good one. [a red sports car drives up] Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?
No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
Uh, I think you dropped this [hands over piece of paper]
Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.
Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while.
I just wanted to say hi.
Do they call you that?
Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.
Okay, okay.
Yeah?
Oh my God!
Hey.
The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was...[car alarm blaring] was in the...
No.
Right?
Absolutely not.
Oh yeah.  Why?
Yes. They totally do.
So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.
Assistant regional manager, yeah.
He has not stopped working for a second.  At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work.  It's exhausting, being this vigilant.  I'll probably have to go home early today.
I actually know a sex model.
Oh yeah.  Wait 'til you get to know her better though.
Well, A for effort right?
So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
She said lots of things.
I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.
Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?
We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.
[in women's bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.
Nope, go back to the script.
You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine.
Well, the group tour is now leaving, then.  Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows.  I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.
Yeah, I do. C'mon. [they hold hands and cross street]
I'm on the phone.
Hey, Jan.
Whoa.
Right.
What do we have here?
Sure!
Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?
Keys, keys...
Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. I'm gonna find him.
That's weird, if it's not locked, why isn't it opening?
[in the stairwell on his phone] Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!
How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything.
Okay.
Thank you.
Oh, come on, Pete! God, that���s just sad. If he doesn���t watch himself, he���s gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.
���Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA��� Dash JH.
I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that's not happening, I'm not averse to just buying them all off.
What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?
[Reading Pam's palm, while she has on extremely padded gloves] Wow, that is really interesting.
Hey, Amy.  How ya doing?
Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it.
[Holds up Hooters t-shirt] Just you know politics, literature.
Thanks!
[Jan enters the office, pushing a stroller] Jan.
[hands Pam Andy's phone] Are there any messages?
Go bag's in the car...  Keys, my keys, where's my keys?
Okay.
So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.
You bet.
But it���s Dwight who���s bring in all the weirdos.
Do you need us for any of this?
Yeah, I can't... really can't move him.
Oh, nice. Did you check that list?
Office romances. Um... [laughs] I think you should probably ask Pam 'cause she's in an office romance, technically.
I did. It was inconclusive.
I won't.  But, you will wash and buff our car.
So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so...
I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves.
You���re gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy���s gonna record it. So we���ll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?
Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.
So what do you think?
Hmm, sounds risky.
Because it's a surprise.
Good.
I think it���s definitely��� Well, okay. Either way���
All right, good stuff.
Yikes.
Yeah, we'd never do that.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what the best play is. Do we tear everything up, or do we buy a horse on the Internet? I mean, I don't know what to do. What do you think?
Is this real? [Pam dumps Michael's screenplay on Jim's desk]
Really for like how long?
That's okay.
Just--Just--Hey!
Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.
Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
[Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]
I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.
No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...
Okay. See you guys.
Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?
It's going to be alright.
Mmhmm.
Still nothin'.
You just had a rebound.
Probably
Nice. [fist bumps Kevin]
Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
[puts his phone in his coffee mug and calls Gabe]
You've been gone for a long time.
Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.
They are terrible.
No, I got it.
Thanks.
This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah.
It's all gold.
I really felt like I almost lost her, and���and nothing is worth that.
[outside] So I'm still in the process of converting the garage.  It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect [opens garage door] for an art studio.  [Pam looks around and then looks at him] Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---
Uh, Kitchen.
You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
So what's in the box?
And I am always busy.
Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally.
[on phone] They hate me, Pam.
Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
Let's go driver! [clapping] Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...
That was really good, Darryl.
Dave.
Why would you start so high?
You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.
Wow.
What? Yeah, right. As if.
Then you did nothing wrong. We should go.
It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. 'Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall.'
Well, Pam I'm not gonna lie to you, he's chances are none. Um, he's 41 years old, he is losing his hair and his cell phone ring is 'Mambo #5.' So...
Okay, Michael!  Focus!
Yep.  Yeah.  She's blind, is that a problem?
She looks older.
Hey! There she is. [Pam laughs] How you doin?
What!?
Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical.
It���s a monkey.
Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.
Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.
Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine.  So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along.
No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.
So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.
[grunts] Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?
What the heck? Is that, uh... [bends down, cuts phone cords with scissors]
Dwight, I uh, I have something to confess.
I think she's awake.
Oh!
Not even an exclamation point?
Okay.
[silently counting] Three, two, one... [Erin turns on the office lights, all laugh loudly]
OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.
Thanks, Toby.
I didn't forget them, they're right here.
Oh, yeah. Pregnant.
I can also take 3 people.
Shut up, you, shut up!  This is the dumbest thing we've ever done.
It was an away game.
[after Pam has another contraction]  That's seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.
No, don't be.
Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.
Andy, come on.
You know this isn't real TV, right?
No.
Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.
I looked at you coming around, and I said, ���Wintergreen.���
Yeah, I want to go home.
Yup.
Yep.
That sounds fun.
Yeah, I thought you started it.
Gettin��� a lot of mileage out of this, aren���t ya?
All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.
Wait, what?
No, I don't.
Lets just go.
[tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no.
Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?
Uh, Michael.
We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.
Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again. [Pam rolls her eyes and walks away]
Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more.
Okay.
No you don't.
[to Jordan] Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.
Perfect.
[grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second?
Because you've solved zero cases.
At a gas station. [oscar laughs]
[Michael is wearing a wig that is very close to Jim's actual hair, and he is wearing fake earrings, and speaking in a punk-ish deep voice] I totally don't know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?
No I didn't.
I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.
Conference room everyone.
You embarrassed me.
[exhales sharply]
Okay. But what is he more famous for?
So this is fun.
[touches headset] Call you right back. What were you saying?
Great, thanks.
Stop [sprays Michael]
Alright...
Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?
Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
No. [re-enters bullpen from kitchen.]
Punishment fits the crime.
Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.
Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.
How many buttons do you have?
Oh.
Okay, man, easy.
You know, it's weird.  It's practically a shot for shot remake.
Really?
Well... yes, that's probably what it is.  So what do I do?
Okay, back to the old grind.
No? Nothin'?
Please do.
Wow. It���s the end of an era.
That sounds awesome.
Everybody's birthday.
Don't take it.
...Absolutely you should.
Hey.
Whoa.
Nice try, this is ridiculous.
Kevin, do it.
Frisbee-based competitions...
Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?
Yeah.
Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?
We can talk about that later.
[turns radio down] What are you thinking?
Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?
We didn't have one scheduled.
Yep, okay...
Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.
I didn't think you'd notice. [laughs nervously] Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him.
I don���t know how else to tell you, okay? I���m doing everything I can every week to bring home something...
Whoa.
So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.
Yeah.
Now, wait a minute.  You're not gonna punch a wall, or me, or anything like that if you don't win the point, are you?
Hey, guys, has anybody seen the baby?
Screw ���em.
We should switch seats in order to...
Stay in bed!
Yep. You're being replaced.
No, just kidding.  Seriously though, that's enough.
Nope.
Let's be honest, it's not totally my fault. [indicates Pam]  Shared responsibility.
Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?
If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
That would be great, thank you.
Oh my God, you do have gonorrhea.
Sounds good.
Yeah, right.
I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy.
Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back.
Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all.
So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
And what happens in this one?
Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.
Well, I mean he humped Michael.
I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.
And the final clue...
Pro-- no favoritism.
[mouthing] So close.
Michael stop.
What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
I will grant you one wish.
I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.
Andy, it's the last day of the quarter. We've already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.
Yeah, oh, I know. Looks great. [Dwight throws the purse over his right shoulder and gets back to work]
[changes channel during commercial, sports scores appear on screen.]
Yikes.
You will never want to leave your room.
Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
Wow, that's not what I meant.
[shakes Michael's hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them]
And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.
I absolutely don't understand, either.
Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can���t give 100% to two things at once you know.
That's alright.
Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?
I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.
Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]
Alright. [they stand up] Excuse me.[They sit down] I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal...
That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can ..
Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham! [mimes punch] Gotta go through me first.
Ah.  That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them.
Do we have a conversation scheduled?
Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.
When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.
Wait a minute.
Howard Cline?
What was that?
No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap.
Yup.
Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. [Michael and Dwight enter] Guys?
Yeah? [to Darryl] You ready?
What would Bob do?
Right.
Yeah.
It's not really food, right?
Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
I know. That's awesome, man. That's great.
Oh yeah, did he text us?
Oh, um... .I can't.
Alright. Why don't you just-
You know, it was one day.
Careful.  There is no inner circle.
Or maybe he's just stuck in character.
I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
But you didn't fail.
Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be
Ok. Well, hey, you're not here. You don't know, Ok? It's intense. They made me eat black licorice.
Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.
It says 'workspace'.
Doesn't it?
Good one.
Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.
Pam. Okay, now I've tried everything.
So, this hot chocolate thing.
Um, [gives Pam a look]
Yes it is.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.
It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.
All right.
You need to stop talking.
Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies [holds up index cards] - that's just unfair.
Si, senor.
Does my room have cable?
Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
Did I? I don't...
Ah, coupon for a free sandwich.
Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay?
Oh, excuse me.  It's my... favorite part.
Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer.
So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?
Nice. Smart.
We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man.
I feel like a stranger in my own country.
Really?
Oh...
This is actually a big potential sale, so...
Dwight...
Ok.
Listen, this isn't a favor, all right?  This is a good idea. We all win.
That is weird.
Andy, can I talk to you for a second?
I love you.
This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.
[turning around to Karen] Wait, are we playing teams?
I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow���s his wedding day. You can���t be anything but happy on your wedding day.
Just have Dwight punch you.
Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -
Does it save time though? ���Cause we���ve been here for about an hour.
Oh, great thanks.
What answers?
Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.
What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
And what's it's name?
Hm. Really tough call.
���Robert, Hey!��� Exclamation point.
Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? You���re clean, right?
Oh... my apartment's on fire
[whispers] Is that Nellie?
We're going to Utica?
That���s pretty good.  What about uh, for a thousand points?
[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm excited.  Oh, definitely.
Nevermind.
Oh yeah, I understood.
These are actually forks and knives from the break room.
They're probably worthless.
[to Pam] Are you cool to just hang out?
Well I���ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn���t believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.
[playing Call of Duty] Oh? Someone's left out in the open, taking a little siesta. Not smart. [shoots] Yes! Finally killed you... [Karen's desk is empty]
Why don't... Let's...
That is a lot of liquor.
All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player.
I have new baby pictures.
Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
Best prank ever.
Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you [in a more and more seductive voice] and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? [Kevin gets up to join the 'hot' team to their great joy] Does that end the debate?
I really heard him on that. This one's interesting I'm not really sure what he meant by this. Um, 'Dwight Schrute Privates.' Tough to say.
Excuse me.
Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go.
Shoot.
Do you?
You look great.
I don't really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.
Right.
I don't know.  Feel like... Friday night crowds...
Hey guys let���s just all admit it. Ok? Dwight���s better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he���s never, ever going to go back on it right?
Go crazy.
[on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]
Yes.
Go! Go! Go!
When do we want it?!
It is... more of a spicy brown, actually.
Aw, it's gonna be the [softly] worst.
Nah, I think it's mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.
Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...
I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.
Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second...
Ready?
Phillies fan, though, right?
Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.
[on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.
Another worm? Like, are they friends?
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?
Uh, uh, ok.
Really?
Did my scores drop a little?
Yeah, I know I should.
Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.
Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about? [Michael leaves]
Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.
Yeah, sold about forty thousand.
Mm-hmm.
I'm just killing Germans, any way I can.
What are you doing?
Fraud.
Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
[half-heartedly] Andy!  Nah, that's too far.
And as you know, I was a paper salesman. [whispers to Darryl] Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked. [group overhears and chuckles]
A...hot chocolate tea
Yes.
Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?
You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?
Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down.
Scuse me?
[points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.
Alright, love you.
Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?
Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
I'm trying everything.
Um... yes.
Pam.
Thanks for the head's up, Kev.
Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?
Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. [Pam laughs]
Actually it sounds like you are.
With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number.
Well, I second that emotion.
There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.
Okay. I can���t say that that���s not fair.
Cool.
As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.
Ok.
I doubt that they're sh-
Michael, watch the road!
And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says 'No, Jim, here's a way.'
Well we all want a good party, right?
No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.
All the time.
Okay.
Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?
No. No. Definitely. It's ..
Andy--- Ohh...
A costume?
Why?
[on phone, leaving a message] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. [hangs up and exhales sharply]
Yes!  I think we should look into that.  If you could just speak up louder...
Notify the athletes.
You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.
Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column.
I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.
Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.
You must be really proud.
Big Red Paper Company?
How was your meeting with Michael?
Excuse me?
What's that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don't, because I've got my eye on you.
Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I did.
Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?
[to Cece] You want a giraffe?
Where are you going?
It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.
Wow.  Never pegged you for a quitter.
Um... 'Cause your condo's in America.
Why are you telling us this?
I closed it!
Uncanny. [everyone applauds]
Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?
No.
OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.
For this?
Great.
Hey, so this isn���t matching up with this���and I���m not sure which one���s right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?
Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?
Mind control.
Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don't know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.
No, no, you saw through me, great.
Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --
So...
You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also? [Pam nods] Yes we will be doing that. We'll be getting a dozen.
Thank you. Your mom is a treasure.
I know why you're doing this, Dwight.
Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We're going to the hospital now.
Well, congrats.
Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.
Ok great.
Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?
Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant.
So, none of them?
Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
I think she wasn't wearing a card.
Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance.
It will be Angela.
Hey, hey, come on, language.
That was, that was a surprise.
So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning.
[knocks on door] Hi.
I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
We're gonna go get him.
What���s up?
Dwight, you wrote that memo. Okay, it's not an official memo.
Yes.
Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?
Man.
Shh.
Wait, I'm serious. It's happening.
Alright.
Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.
He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.
What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!
I didn't ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away]
So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.
I don't know. Is it what you expected?
Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.
Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.
No, I....
So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back.
Oh! There it is!
Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you���d ever set foot in in this town?
Uncanny.
I think you're under-thinking it.
To get married.
What's that?
[in office] Are you sure?
Thanks, Pam.
Oh, wow. But, um���Oh, I get that.
Lucky us.
Right.
Umm... sure.
I was just... I'm in love with you.
Alright. [Jim's phone rings] Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?
It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.
[in unison] I do not think that is funny.
Are we even sure that's my file?
Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?
Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]
Oh, and I get to carry it.
Alright.
Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?
Sales.
Good.
Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
You can't yell out 'I need this, I need this' as you pin down an employee on your lap!
I just don't know if he's presidential enough.
Big day.
[drawing two family trees on a whiteboard] Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through [draws a question mark] delusion.
Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes]
Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? [Karen smiles and gives herself away] Wow. Ok. You got me.
In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment.
Oh, don���t look at me cause I think you���re making a terrible choice.
[goofy voice] Frank and Beans. [laughs] Always makes her laugh.
Ok.
What?
Really?
Wind.
Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?
Good.
And there's my talking point.
Will do. [hangs up]  I'll stop calling.  [walks into lobby]
Hey, how is... Toby?
Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
[laughs] Told you.
No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.
[goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait.
What���s that?
Thanks.
Have a good night.
I just-
Yep.
Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.
Don't..
Thank you.
No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, 'world's longest engagement', um, we're all expecting it, you know?
Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?
Yep. [shuts door behind him]
Yeah... .you want me to come in your office?  Oh.
I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
Where... did you learn all of this?
Oh no, no, no. That's ok. [Jim shoves some snacks in his pocket as he gets out of limo] Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center?
Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.
What about music?  Do you have any music?
Not enough? I don���t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it���s against the rules but I���m gonna need a favor from you guys.
Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.
By the way, they do need an extra day next week.
Ok, this is crazy.
Big day.
Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.
Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here...
You know what, just in case she's looking you should put some stuff in it.
Right? So, uh, let's uh...
I'll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye.
It's a pen.
Um, like stapler tennis or something like that.
You knew it the whole time, buddy.
I think I'm ready.
What's going on? Where's the belsnickel?
Well, that is... because you didn't realize that... I was left-handed.
Can I get a drink?
Right. It's city and country combined.
You're messing with me.
Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.
You know, truth be told, I think all you���ll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I���m gone.
Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.
Perfect.
Dwight! Are your legs broken?
[looks around room nervously]
I... will... [gives up and walks away]
I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.
You can write a book about chairs.
Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...
I can imagine.
Uh-huh.
[brings Michael into his office] So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?
No, that was unbelievable.
That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.
And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.
Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh.
All right.
So you like her?
I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. [behind Jim, Dwight climbs telephone pole] Oh he'll be fine. I made it up there.
Yes, you should.
Have I not proposed to you, yet?
Would...
This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -
Merry Christmas Dwight.
Okay.  Sshh.  I know.  [hands the baby to Pam]
I know. And I can���t do it.
Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...
Ah, definitely blue.
No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.
Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.
I just thought you should---
[getting up quickly to silence Michael] No, no. Nope.
What is Yankee Swap?
Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?
It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
Let���s do it!
No. [Michael gets up and walks into his office]
Oh. Actually, it's just gonna be me.
I miss that.
Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...
Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this: umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. [reveals Dwight's purple belt]
Nope, I got eel.
Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don���t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
An Altima or better.
Yeah.
What was you? You were the leak?
Okay. I���m really sorry I told the guys I���d be there for the board meeting.
Dwight?
What kinda iPhone is that?
Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...
Can I have a late checkout?
You see that?  I'm pretty sure she's...  Hi.
And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.
You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine.
Okay. Roy.
You're not, nope.  Nope.
It is going really great.
Dwight. This, [picks up balloon] fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?
Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
That's him.
Ah, let's do it. [laughs] Oh, that's healthy.
Why is she here?
Bye, Angela. All right, Kev.
I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
[to Cathy] Sorry about that.
Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-
I'm so sorry, I forgot.
Oh, yeah?
Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.
[flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?
Yeah.
Okay, you could just show up late though.
Yep.
What is it?
I'm excited, I've actually never been to Gettysburg. Uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so I freaked out and we turned the car around. But I'm older now, I can outrun a zombie.
Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
Yeah, that was nuts.
Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna���
Okay, the limo���s gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready ���cause I want to pack in a lot.
Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he���ll be calling in any second.
Sorry. Man. [Pam hesitates and then leaves]
Oh, that one was good.
Okay. Do you want me to stay?
I���m on the phone. I���m on the phone.
Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable.
Whoo.
You do?
Okay.
I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.
Fireball!
I play.
[sings Olympic theme song] This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.
Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it���s a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...
Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
What?
Yep.  No, I mean I really liked it.  I thought was uh, a fun read.
So what are you going to do?
Ahh, these aren't leads. What are they?
Check this out though, spin serve. [serves, and Dwight scores] Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...
Awww, sorry. Did it break?
Oh.
You should ask him. It���s a color you would never expect. [Dwight storms off] Too easy.
All right. Bye.
Hey, Dwight. I need your stapler.
I don't know though. I mean, you know that was a hit.
Okay, you know what?  I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?
Done, right?
Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?
I was gonna go with this one.
We bonded. We got to- [Dwight starts dropping into the bus on top of Jim]
So instead, you screwed me?
[in the conference room] Hey Pam, can I see you for a second?  So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day.  So he generously offered to wash our car.
Oh. Um. I think we're good.
No he doesn't.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
See?
Oh wow, these are nice.
[to Karen] Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole.
Thank you, Meredith.
Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it.  We'll figure it out.  We'll be okay.
[arm around Pam] Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.
Yes.
How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.
Yes, it is.
Do you know the industry is in decline?
What's up, buddy?
Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.
God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.
Stanley doesn't have a moustache.
Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.
No, it's, it's okay. Okay.
All right, guys. It didn���t work out for any of us, so��� we���re still on the same team. Let me get these.
No. Looks good.
Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. [looks at camera] You know what, just come here.
All right!
Mm, can't do that.
[claps] All right.
Wow, I'm really sorry.
Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter.
Sounds good Andy.
Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks.
Well, in an ideal world...
[chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.
Michael, you didn't even know her.
Did you feel like crying?
Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that.
Come on, who doesn't like a picnic?
Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?
No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
You know her name.
Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?
Which one was it?
[to Pam] I'm so sorry for all of this.
It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
Let's go to the conference room.
Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of ���Pilot���]
Anybody could have walked in.
Umm...
Michael, it's really not a competition.
Oh, great.
Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
I would prefer not to.
Still haven't left the house yet, huh?
But if not, there's always the army. The infantry.
How did those get out? I'm sorry.
Gross!
Great. Where did you get it?
Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'.
Who, Steve?
Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?
No, not more than anything.
Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me���[gets interrupted by Andy].
I think she will.
I'm just kidding. She told me about it.
Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
Wow.
Ok.
We did it.
What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?
Sure, yeah, go ahead.
[looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled 'administrative' and 'assistant.'
It���s just a list of our names, split into two columns.
Hey Kelly. What's up?
OK...
Where are you going out tonight?
Did you really?
Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
How are you?
I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.
Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.
Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch.
Alright, there you go.
[using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight]
[Jim slams lunchbag on table] I just totally blew a sales call.
Billy Joel Rock Band.
Really?
Oh.
Nah. Might as well do it now.
Am I the only one that���s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
Five movies. Go ahead.
[on phone] Absolutely.  I couldn't be more sorry about this.
S'ok.
[to camera] Didn't see that one coming.
Does he ever.
I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.
Beardy?
Oh, I thought it was your mom.
No, uh-
Mm-hmm.  Okay, great.  Well, sorry.
[to Dwight] All right. So... I guess this is it.
Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud.
Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry.
Thank you Angela.
Oh wow, thank you.
Oh! Hire a magician.
What was?
Oh, okay. Hello. Hey, David. Sure.
That���s why it���s so clean.
That's all right.
No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
He... It's a crime fighting beaver.
Huh.
Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?
This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
Are you sure it doesn't hurt?
You'd slow me down.
Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?
Uh, can you get this rundown for me?' [impersonating Charles]
See ya. See ya. [Charles leaves] Bye!
���Gotta go! Darth Vader's launching a huge attack.���
Really?
Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.
Wow, this is my lucky day.
Improv sounds great.
[on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.
[laughs] Thanks Dwight.
Come on. He'll listen to you.
You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.
Yeah, I didn't think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.
Wow.  I guess word got around.  That's a nice... honor.
That���s obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
Yeah?
Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?
Yes.
Hey, easy, easy...
Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing.
OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?
Uh, hit and run.
Come on, man.
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings]
Nope.
Mosquito.
Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?
Good game Meredith.
Ooh.
Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. [Pam nods reluctantly]  And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date.
Now you're just being hurtful.
We tried to find the fairest way to do it.
[laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.
Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..
Allergy to... the desk?
But you know I wouldn���t hire any of these all-stars.
You sure?
Well...
So, where are you shipping your foot?
I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
[to Dwight] Nice.
That's... not okay.
[laughs] Um, ok. [thinks but says nothing]
[Car horn honking] Oh, Roy.
Oh...
Nope.
[a text tone goes off] Is that my phone?
So, you ready for the... the Dundies?
Actually not.  It was really so-so.
Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God.
Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out. [closes door]
[everyone shouting at once] Michael! Michael!
Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.
Dwight, how's the hotel business?
Not that I know of.
Oh my God.
Wow.
okay.
Yeee... (grunts in frustration)
Left.
[talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?
[looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off]
[interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?
So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?
So weird.
Smasher!
All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-
Oh my God, there
I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife���
Mmmkay...
Thank you, thank you. OK.
OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.
Phoenix Sun's point guard?
But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. [Jim sees Roy and trails off]
Oof. ���Infertility.���
I like the wild card.  I'm already liking the wild card.
Which is you.
In the women's bathroom, above the sink.
Yeah, you can.
Yes.
Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?
Wow.
No, Dwight. You���ll be doing the whacking.
Second line.
So it's going great, sounds like.
Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.
You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.
Oh, tell him I say hi.
I'm sorry what are you whispering about?
Oh, Andy.  You know what?  We don't have a
Anna Maria's.
Well we are here now, so let's just--
I would like to lose 65 pounds.
He brings up two good points.  Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?
Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.
Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out.
I think they're going to the conference finals.
What was this? [Makes face]
I don't think you had to.
Yeah?
Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. [Andy hums Six Flag ad] Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?
[Meredith's hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh!
That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.
Stop right there. I love it.
She'd be perfect for you.
That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right?
Hey hey hey. Everything okay?
Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date.
Erin.
And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.
Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
Sorry.
Ok.
Talk to me.
...in your condo complex.
No.  Thank you.
Well, you seem to have this under control.
Here we go...
[sighs] Hey David, how would you like a guy who���s not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?
Oh my God.
Okay.
My condolences.
Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion.
You know what?  Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place.  Happy thoughts, Pam.  Happy thoughts.
No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair.
Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.
What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
Who is this?
Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
I think you did.
Tony the tiger.  You don't hear that much any more.
No, can't help you now.
If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, 'Well that's pretty premature to think,' but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.
Dwight-
Uh-huh, yeah.  I am.
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
[On phone in hallway] No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.
Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!
I, ah...
Sure.
Great. [to a group of guests]  Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!
Mmum, still wrong.
KGB.
Oh, Somebody went in. That was a team effort, Pam.
She dies.
Okay. You don���t need my help?
[picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.
All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
[disgusted groan]
Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned.
Really? Why?
Gravel company?
Okay... Holly's back.
What did I do to deserve this?
Do you?
Hey, Toby!
Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]
Sometime today.
Cece!
Mm-hmm.
Yeah! [to camera] Guten Prank number two.
Phyllis and Robert.
Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky.
No, no, don't do anything to them.
Give the bottle to Michael!
Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away.
[Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.
You burned
It's still on a bike path though right?
Oh, that's good.
Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?
Let's go.
Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works.
Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...
[raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?
Okay.
So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I'm saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn't he?
But you hear the baby crying, right?
Umm���.
Nice.
What are you reading?
You have a better idea?
Great.
Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.
Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.
Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
Sure.  Let me just finish this turn.
I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it.[Pam laughs] OK, good luck!
Hey. I was just about to call you.
So then, why didn't you do it?
Ok.
Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
Talla-nasty', very clever.
Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela.
Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?
Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.
Yeah?
Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. [Reveal Jim behind Quad-Desk] Thank you.
No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
Hello?
Why?
Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.
Wow, that's not such a bad idea.
Why would I wanna do that?
[wearing a tuxedo] I don't know. Is it classy enough?
Do we all have our copy of 'Threat Level: Midnight', by Michael Scott?
[sighs and knocks on Michaels door]
Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!
[reads] 'Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie.'
Okay.
[laughing]  Um, you know what?  I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell.
I drive a Saab station wagon.
Barely, I... I don't have all the facts.  Frank and Bean...
[coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks.
Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.
Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday.  So, keep that goin'.
You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.
Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.
I have no idea.
Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.
We're back in! Right?
Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.
My home office, this is it.
[shakes head]
Damn it guys!
[opens door to Gabe's office] All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again. [Gabe motions that he's on the phone] 'Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.
That's cool.
Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think...
Hey.
See you.
Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?
I disagree with.
[on the phone] Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!
Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...
Go get 'em.
I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee.
Hey.
[smelling the stink] Oh.  Wow.
[ahem] You can... [slightly effeminate] You can do it Ryan.
Michael. Am I the first to arrive?
Nurse!
Stop.
Okay, good. Stay right here.
Mad?  How could I be mad?  We're having a little girl.
[talking on phone] Sure, I can hold.
Yeah?
Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it... [being pulled away by Pam]
Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?
And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
Alright. Great. Thank you.
Hello?
The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.
Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.
I'm sorry. This is for a news audition?
No.
Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]
You cut more than you had to, didn't you?
She was always engaged.
I'll call you when I get in.
Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis.
Yeah, we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything.
That's not it.
You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?
[under breath] Oh, no, not while I'm here.
Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now.
Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input���
Oh I'm sorry.  What?
Okay.
Stop.
Yeah.
No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.
Not a surprise.
Yeah. Big sale. Don���t worry about it though, I don���t really care about the points.  I would like a point receipt though���[on phone] Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald���can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. [gets up to give Erin his point receipt]
You pet the animals and they pet you back.
Can we not?
Look, you have a lot of strengths.
[Jim face]
Yeah.
Do ya?
Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.
You're writing something?
Who, Stacy?
Mm-hmm.
Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.
Michael stop. [sprays Michael, then Dwight]
No, not at all.
No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this.
No, I'm sure you're right.
And Jim will say nothing.
I'll try both.
Is this allowed?
Good Lord! [Photo of Cece on Jim's desktop] I can't believe I'm missing this.
Oh man, that's crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.
Pam, don't worry about it.
Oh.
[to Michael] Will you stop?
Ohh...
Hey, Andy.  How are you, man?
Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
Yeah.
[looks in  the refrigerator] Hey Dwight, my tuna sandwich isn't in the refrigerator. You wouldn't know anything about that would you?
I'm gonna help you through it all right?
I know.
Their bread is very good.
I'll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!
Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away]
All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.
You really wanna bet?
[picks up phone] Hello?
Thank you, Dwight.
Oh, Holy Mother of God.
Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
Wow, can we make it a different moment?
Okay. Michael. Could you beat up Michael?
Bat birth control
That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
[at the Halpert residence as Cece twirls in the front yard, exiting front door] Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma���s got breakfast, OK? [to camera] We are going to Roy���s wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife���s ex-fianc�����s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it���s your wife���s ex-fianc��.
Let's move on to the next.
[watching baseball game on TV] Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out.
[whispering] Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
OK, what are you --
Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- [texting on his phone]
No.
Great.
No one wants to be you, Dwight.
No, that was his wife, so he's on his way.
Ayyyy!
Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] 'The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert.' Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.
OK, I don���t have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
Tell me about the cologne. How much?
No, I did that before, it added nothing.
Umm, Michael.
Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot.
I don't want -
Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea.  Let's go out.
He's just mad that we're all having fun.
[not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [sic] energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  [David laughs] So that's a... bonus.
You do?
No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back.
Oh, come on, that sounds awesome.
Oh, good.
Uh huh.
Okay, Dwight��� Dwight��� Dwight, Dwight Dwight!��� uh���
Wish us luck!
Let's do it.
Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.
Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.
It's true. I'm having a party.  I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up.  [sighs]  He is very real.
I don't know how we'd go about doing that.
Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.
Oh my God!  Wait, this goes back two years.
Ok, thanks.
Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.
[concerned look on face] You okay?
What? What am I gonna do? I don���t ���
Oh yeah.
You don't have to lie.
Hey, whoa, Michael...
Hey, sorry everybody.
Hey.
Are you serious? [starts typing on the computer and Andy begins to lean in toward the computer]
Let's see it. Show of hands.
That's not what that is.
Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
Yeah sorry everyone else didn���t come.  I think they���re just tired.  With holes in their shoes.  And they have dysentery.
No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.
Of course I read it.
Sorry it didn't work out. Hope you find what you're looking for.
Uh...
No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is: really sorry.
Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel?
How's it going, man?
Sure.
I thought that concert was pretty great.
Bribery. Nice.
Yeah.
Angela, burger? Dog?  Havin' fun?
Yes.
Thanks.
Hey, I���m in Philadelphia right now.
So, I guess I'll see you in [looks at watch] ten hours.
For what?
Oh, you know what? I gotta go.
Smart.
I don't know, what?
LOVE the hair. [Ryan walks up driveway with blonde dyed hair]
Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool.
Oh, my God, thank you. [hugging both] Thank you.
Thanks, Charles.
The temp?
Perfect. [misses]
No.
It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-
You���re not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I���m in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You���ve agreed to this.
I think she'd be a really good salesperson.
I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?
And how many kitchens?
K, Kevin, are you saying ���See the world���? or ���Sea World?���
And a dart board.
Thanks.
You playing that game again?
[stops the watch] One second.
Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving.
I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.
But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
Yeah, I know.
Okay.
We were... I think she was just trying to-
OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-
Eh, she's nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
Oh. Three nines.
No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.
[Michael give Jim a 'World's Best Boss' mug] Thank you.
Michael, you don't have to do this.
That's not what I meant.
So, as it turns out, Dwight is right. How bizarre.
