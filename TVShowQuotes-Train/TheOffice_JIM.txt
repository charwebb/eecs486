Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot.
Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?
I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.
It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ...
Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.
It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
Don't. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator.
Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right.
Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.
Call me when you get in. [kisses Pam]
Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...
Post-it Notes. Wow, that purse holds a lot.
Oh, come on, Pete! God, that���s just sad. If he doesn���t watch himself, he���s gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.
How much time do you have left on your break?
Oh, Andy.  You know what?  We don't have a
And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.
You know what you should do? Take a vacation.
And as you know, I was a paper salesman. [whispers to Darryl] Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked. [group overhears and chuckles]
So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.
Ok, we didn't dance.  I was totally joking anyway.  I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance.  Right?
It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.
Yeah. All right. Bye. [Kevin sinks putt] All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?
...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.
Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.
Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.
Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing]
Hey, do you guys have any other games?
We bonded. We got to- [Dwight starts dropping into the bus on top of Jim]
So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.
Yeah, right. I mean, unless they���re willing to pass some tests.
Oh, burn.  Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too. [they laugh]
No way. I think she likes this stuff.
And who cares?  It's a stupid veil, right?
Just then, Agent Chang gets a bullet in the head.
Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
Phyllis says the same twelve clich��s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.
Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.
If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.
Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
[laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?
Is that... I didn't know that was your... okay, so we're in agreement, this is not ideal... situation.
[pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's���I think she understands... what this is.
Six point five days. [winces as Kevin smacks him on the back]
No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.
Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard.
Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.
No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'.
Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?
No, that was his wife, so he's on his way.
Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. [starts walking away]
I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.
Yeah, we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything.
[walks into his office and sees the mallard back on his desk] Dwight, you brought the mallard back.
I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.
Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep.
Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don���t worry. I���ll figure it out.
You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.
[in women's bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.
Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me���[gets interrupted by Andy].
I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.
I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
How far away did you think we were?
Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down.
To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle.
Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night.  So...
Oh wow.  So that���s two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
Well, that is... because you didn't realize that... I was left-handed.
[as Pam has another contraction]  Oh!  Oh, alright.  That's a good one.
No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this!
Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? [pause] I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.
I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over?
Not even a thought!  It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!
Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
Ok, so promise that you'll wait till we leave the parking lot before you go to the bar.
OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.
Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that.
Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable.
Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied.
Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.
Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children?
No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this.
Party looks fun doesn���t it?  Everybody seems to be in there having a great time.  So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
If it's the same thing, then why did you write 'workspace'?
Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.
Pam gets a little down.  Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago.
No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--
Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?
Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly.
New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?
Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.
[walking to his car] Hey, it's me.  It is 5:03.
But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.
It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?
Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. [Windows reboot sound] Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?
Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.
No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...
[Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
Okay. Let's start with the 'I love you' level.
Okay. The annex it is. I���ll be sitting at your desk if that���s okay with you.
All right, you know what? [picks Pam up and carries her off the court] Let's do this.
All right. ��Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues]
And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat]
Darryl, it doesn���t matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.
[back to Pam] Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.
This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that���s for fueling only. No savoring.
Okay, you could just say you don't know what's going on.
Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-
I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn���t love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid���wonderful���boring���amazing job.
Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.
Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans!
Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys. [to Pam, under his breath] Can I have your sunglasses?
Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal. [in voiceover] I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.
But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.
Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.'
Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.
You're right, we didn't dance.  It was more like, swaying.  But still romantic.
Are you really gonna marry him?  [Pam nods] ...Ok.
Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham! [mimes punch] Gotta go through me first.
Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.
Story's kinda bland.  It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion.
Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned.
I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That���s it. You look really, really good.
[Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear.
Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.
Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?
Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.
Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam.
And in this room here, if you look closely, you will find out a few clues about who lives here.  Um, he likes biking, obviously, and uh, what else?  Uh, he likes tour guides, I guess.  And if you're very perceptive, you'll notice that he didn't do a great job of cleaning his room [kicks water bottle under bed].  Ok, and uh, that's the tou-
Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away]
Well, I should hope so. [Michael takes phone] Who is this?
Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that���s only gonna make things worse.
Well, I can't be the only one who didn't -- [sees mugs on Angela's and Meredith's desks]
Stanley. Uhh��� you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.]
But you know I wouldn���t hire any of these all-stars.
Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.
Okay. Have you ever seen the movie Sixth Sense? Maybe you are already dead.
Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.
I think it'll take you a little longer than that.
Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...
Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.
Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.
[clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up]
[after Pam checks her cell phone] What's going on?
No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.
This is hilarious, but we���re gonna stop with all--
You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.
Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...
Oh, did the press ask for a story?
Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.
Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.
That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?
Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.
He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?
I promise you, you don���t have to do this for me.
Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.
Let���s not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you���re expecting a fax today, please don���t yell out, ���Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.��� Ok? That���s nonsense.
[in the stairwell on his phone] Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!
Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped.
Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case���let���s get to work.
Are you really sure we should be leaving?
Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people.
You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!
Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance.
I'm Jim. [Jim hi-fives Abby] Annnnd... let's sell some paper.
Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything.
Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?
To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.
We don���t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-
So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning.
This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.
I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?
That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...
I���m really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?
I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah.
Nice.  That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.
That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?
Those are the books that sum up the other books.
Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.
Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.
You could just be saying it to get the job.
[looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled 'administrative' and 'assistant.'
Dwight. Dwight. [Dwight's car comes screeching into view]
Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?
You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.
Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.
Yeah, oh, I know. Looks great. [Dwight throws the purse over his right shoulder and gets back to work]
He's just mad that we're all having fun.
That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.
Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.
Forget it. It's just a dry erase board.
Yeah. It���s real. It���s the only way you���ll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She���s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical.
So what is going on, girl in the computer?
Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.
Yes!  I think we should look into that.  If you could just speak up louder...
[Michael walks in] Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets.  Do you want to-
Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.
I was blue group, so it was second from the top.
Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.
Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.
Hey man. I am so sorry about that.
[at the Halpert residence as Cece twirls in the front yard, exiting front door] Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma���s got breakfast, OK? [to camera] We are going to Roy���s wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife���s ex-fianc�����s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it���s your wife���s ex-fianc��.
Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.
I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
[on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.
And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.
Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?
This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I'm not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley's tie is really the story of the day...
Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.
So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.
Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.
Oh, one hundred percent.  We all want to see you tattoo your ass.
Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!
Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?
Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.
That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.
No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is: really sorry.
Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.
Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?
Try this. [takes Dwight's 'Asian' race and switches it with the one he wrote]
Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?
All right. Now I think it's time for you to go.
OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.
Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.
And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.
I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.
Is this real? [Pam dumps Michael's screenplay on Jim's desk]
[Michael is seen debating on whether to come back in to the office] Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?
Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss.
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?
Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I���m gone.
No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I���m gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.
[leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen]
Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry. [Pam looks at Jim] Sorry. I think I'm just hungry.
Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical.
Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
It���s from the teapot. Everything you���ll ever need to know is in that note. [Pam reads the card] Not enough for me? You are everything.
No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith���s face.  And if that  makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.
Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.
I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?
[after entering daycare] Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.
[arm around Pam] Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.
Yes, it is harassment and I'm going to be suing the winking face. I've hired the angry face as my lawyer and you will be hearing from him pretty soon.
Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over.
Alright. [they stand up] Excuse me.[They sit down] I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal...
Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here.
It's not.  It's different.  But it's a good book.
I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back.
Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair.
I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.
No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back.
Um... Whoa. [picks up ringing phone][in managerial voice] Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm  hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.
Hey! Can I talk you? For a second?
Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies [holds up index cards] - that's just unfair.
Yeah, we did. Hey, how long���how long do we think that���s gonna take?
Well it's just that you had no hair on Friday.
I found Dwight's wallet in the parking lot.
Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God.
[opens door to Gabe's office] All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again. [Gabe motions that he's on the phone] 'Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.
Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.
Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.
Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.
Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?
So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one.
Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?
So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.
I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.
No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.
OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later. [hangs up]  That was a good story.
It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.
Pam's doing great.  Uh, she's ten inches dilated now.  Uh, sorry, meters.  Centimeters.  And she's also fully faced.  Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet.  It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.
Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like.
Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?
How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran.
Angela, it���s Halloween. You have to sing ���Monster Mash���.
So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I'm saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn't he?
OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... [Pam starts laughing]... spy on our other branch. No no no.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what the best play is. Do we tear everything up, or do we buy a horse on the Internet? I mean, I don't know what to do. What do you think?
All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
Oh, Clark. I���m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.
I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.
Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, 'For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?' and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
I think they're going to the conference finals.
Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small-[pointing to Angela] Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!
It's still happening right now actually, so uh...
That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot.
[to Eric] You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.
Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?
I'm gonna write you up for not working.
Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.
[on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big.
I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves.
I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.
So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.
Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?
I think it���s definitely��� Well, okay. Either way���
Dwight, it's not a factory at all. Do you have to do what you are doing? [Dwight is tapping each of the bobble heads on his desk and making them bobble]
Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?
I don't know what else we can do here.
She's, um, she's in New York. She's at an art school.
Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along.
Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.
How many words per minute does the average person type?
Yeah, I do. C'mon. [they hold hands and cross street]
Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and we're basically there.
Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1:15.
College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
[trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
[points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.
What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?
I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?
You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?
Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...
I���m doing this just for me? Is that what I���m doing? I���m doing it just for me. If that���s what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?
Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.
Another bullets heads towards Agent Michael Scarn, but he jumps out of the plane without a parachute.
Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?
Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, [starts snapping] you're a Jet all the way, right?
Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
I've always gotten along well with Toby.  Uh, we're friends.  But I don't think we'll stay in touch necessarily.  I think I'll probably get updates on him from Pam.
He has not stopped working for a second.  At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work.  It's exhausting, being this vigilant.  I'll probably have to go home early today.
Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don't worry about it.
I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp...
Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it.  We'll figure it out.  We'll be okay.
That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.
I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?
I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --
Hey dude, you know what a 'rundown' is?
You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?
We got to see Ping.  [Pam nods] And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. [Pam nods] Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. [Pam nods] Which for me, has ruined them for life. [looks at Pam, who is staring at him, nodding]
Oh, yeah, so we���ll just do that later.
I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.
Okay, it���s not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.
And I was still just a paper salesman.
I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California��� for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.�� He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don���t really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.���� And he chose���
Why wouldn't you see him?  You work for him.
Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.
[grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.
Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that.
And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.
[takes her hand] Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, you're so pretty.
Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.
Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--
I didn't think you'd notice. [laughs nervously] Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him.
I just don't know if he's presidential enough.
So what did he say? Was it my fault?
No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.
Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he���ll be calling in any second.
Hey! There she is. [Pam laughs] How you doin?
I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.
[quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.
I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.
[on phone, leaving a message] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. [hangs up and exhales sharply]
[Sighs] I'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes.
Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own
[to babysitter] So... how do you guys know each other?
I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- [pulls out a pie chart] How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.
Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.
[whispering, going into the bathroom with Cece] Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!
Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.
I'm not writing, 'Horse Hunt.' I don't even know what that means.
Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think...
Anything. [Dwight begins to fill his new purse] Good. Yup.
Is it me, or are we just a little off today?
When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. ��I just wanted... to go home. ��This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013. ��You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space.
A7557962.' Totally nonsense numbers, but you do what you have to do.
I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD.
I think I���m a little too busy these days to s--- [whispering] Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.
I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?
Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..
[dancing with Pam. They kiss] See, now you don���t owe me anything.
Uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'Cause otherwise we can't do any work.
[interrupting] Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right? [tosses black licorice into trash]
I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]
[To Dwight] So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?
- two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.
No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.
Co-managing is a give and take.  You have to pick your battles.  One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them.  He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.
I���m sure you did not. What was your question?
[Pam is asleep, resting her head on Jim's shoulder] Um... Hey.
Ah, ah, ah. Where's the 'please'? We're not animals.
I don't know.  Feel like... Friday night crowds...
In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment.
You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.
[partially blown up balloons on table and hanging from streamers] Are you kidding?
I think you're good.  Doing a good job.
The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
[flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?
Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it.
At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it.  I'm told it started as a team building exercise.  Unfortunately I really suck at it.  We didn't play many video games in Scranton.  Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor.  And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus.
[coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks.
Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with.
I���m sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment.
Oh, I just mean if you, if you didn't lock the door, then we could be upstairs where it's warmer.
No, it- [high-pitched feedback as Jim starts to leave, feedback changes as he moves, turns over the mallard to see the listening devics, sighs, places mallard back on the desk]
What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?
You���re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...
How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
Yeah, no one can snap with their little finger.
[reads demerit] 'Jim Halpert, tardiness.' Ugh. I love it already.
I think I left my wallet in your house.
So, where did you learn how to play?
Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out. [closes door]
[under breath] Oh, no, not while I'm here.
Well, that is because that is the gift that keeps on giving. Oh, my God. I left today's paper on my desk.
Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?
[on the phone]I can have it to you by the beginning of next week.  Alright? Thanks very much. [hangs up] Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?
If anyone can do this, you can do this.
I wouldn���t be too sure about that. Just saying.
Animation? All her by the way. [points at Pam]
Will do. [hangs up]  I'll stop calling.  [walks into lobby]
Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.
Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
[puts his phone in his coffee mug and calls Gabe]
[laughs and swings his arm out which doesn't come close to touching the reception desk] I'm always this close.
Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?
Alright. [Jim's phone rings] Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?
Well, turns out he actually made it up there.
Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.
No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.
Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
Just cut through it, man, it's no big deal.
Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?
And then you go to school for three years.
Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!
That'd be great, thank you. [Erin throws package, it hits Kathy. She thinks it was Jim who threw it]
I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy.  But I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  [reading from various books]  Five to seven minutes.  Five to seven minutes.  Six minutes.  Different, but not really.  Five to seven minutes.
So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal.  It's Lackawanna County.  Our whole county.  And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch.  And I could work here for years.  And years.  [groan] Years.
Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.
Don���t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.
We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.
Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.
Travel.  I've been looking forward to it.  It's gonna be... really nice.  Gonna find myself.
In Philly, so, that doesn���t really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.
Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
I think I did a pretty good job.
[to camera, holds up a bean] Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture [walking around the table] of who you think deserv-- who's that? [picture that Michael drew of toby, looks like a monster]
My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with.'
I bought it.  It's ours.  Let's go inside, I'll show you inside.  [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor.  Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet.  Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall]  Yeah, I am really sorry about this.  I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there.  Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.  [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so... [shuts the door]
Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents...
Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.
Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.
I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.
Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.
Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
I have no idea where we���re gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.
Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]
Uh, can you get this rundown for me?' [impersonating Charles]
Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, he's the drummer and the singer.
I've spent so much of my life telling myself 'Please, don't end up like Stanley,' and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes.
See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you.
That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?
Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
[waiting outside the bathroom for Pam, he is holding a hand-picked bouquet of flowers and pacing] These are for you.
I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...
Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  I'll talk to them.
[Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course
[enters] Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They���re going to make you pay for the fish, and��� they wanted to know when you can start.
We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man.
You���re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh���
There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.
I mean, you were gonna do this without me?
So how does it work? It���s like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or���
[grunts] Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?
I'm sorry, wait, so is the question 'How'd I get to be so awesome?' [laughs] Because, I don't have an answer for you. [laughs]
[notices cleaning crew coming up to the gate] Cleaning people. Oscar. [everyone starts to walk outside] OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us.
Well, maybe you should get back to work.
I... Why would you just say something like that?
Right, cause that's what we are talking about.
Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
Ah, good. Good luck. Doing good. [goes to the index cards and writes another race down]
If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.
OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?
Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...
Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?
My name is Jim Halpert and I am a sales rep, which is a very important job. Um, without me dozens literally dozens of small businesses would go paperless.  They would have to write on their hands, or bed sheets, or who knows you know. Total chaos, total chaos. I mean or they could get their paper somewhere else. Staples maybe. I don't know.
[starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn.  Four seconds.
You will never want to leave your room.
Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking...
Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  [cell phone rings; Dwight's voice saying 'Idiot, Idiot, Idiot'] Oh, that's my new 'Dwight' ring.
Why did I transfer to Stamford?  I think that's pretty obvious.  I got promoted!  And you can't beat that view... right?
Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.
Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open.
Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]
Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.
What I���m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I���ve ever said.
You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also? [Pam nods] Yes we will be doing that. We'll be getting a dozen.
Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation?
We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just - [blows air] - all in.
Wow.  Um, ok. [pops Dwight's orb with scissors]
Chapter 2 ��� Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.
The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.
You could���ve just called that an alliance too, right?
Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.
[blows a raspberry, Erin looks shocked, Kevin chuckles]
The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty.
Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?
Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.
Michael, we only told our parents last week.
This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?
So this is my life.  Until I win the lottery [laughs].  Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
Oh, tomorrow, that's gonna be tough 'cause I already laid out my outfit, so...
[on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
This... is the future, because... This is the past. I���ve been through a lot of issues in my life. I���ve seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I���ve been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause]
I'm gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids.
Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.
[to Pam] Are you cool to just hang out?
[Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop.
I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.
Okay, you know what?  I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  He'd probably know...
[slinking out of the room] Alright, you are welcome.  I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.
What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?
I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.
Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?
I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment,  is the only one who raises her hand]
Have you ever seen 'em do that? [walk outside and the parking lot is covered with snowmen]
Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
[laughs] Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.
And that's why it's on my desk, Phyllis; it means a lot to me, and now that I know it was from you, it means even more.  Moving on!  Uh, ok, so that's the end of the tour for now, and if you liked it please tell your friends: 'Whenever you're in Scranton, visit Casa de la Halpert'.
Nnnno.  Uh, turns out, it was just a really bad idea involving fire.  But I think I fixed it.
Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift]
I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...
No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.
Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.
[Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um��� I don���t know how to tell you this, but��� we have a little bit of a problem.
One second 'cause that sounds really good. Is jackass one word or two? [Dwight sighs] One, right? 'Cause, 'cause of the show, it's one.
[brings Michael into his office] So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?
And I have started a business in Philadelphia. [Pam shrugs]
All right!  [sitting down behind Michael's desk] I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but...
And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back.
Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]
No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!
Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
All right, well it already went through, so...
Either way, Dwight��� I can���t be there for you. I���m sorry.
Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.
So, as it turns out, Dwight is right. How bizarre.
Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?
So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?
Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]
Hey uh, Michael.  Don't jump on the bouncy castle.  You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured.
Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.
Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back.
Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. [pulls up Dwight's game] Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.
Closed. [Michael leaves his office, gives Jim two thumbs up, which Jim returns]
Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?
Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so...
No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.
[points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean?
Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret.
So I guess I'll just... work on my short game.
[listening to and editing Jo's book on tape]
Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?
I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.
[Michael in his office playing music loudly, Jim walks in and turns the volume down, Michael trailing off on singing]  We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.
Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
Okay. I can���t say that that���s not fair.
Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that.
Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.
Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?
Is that not what happens when you're high?
Yeah sorry everyone else didn���t come.  I think they���re just tired.  With holes in their shoes.  And they have dysentery.
Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.
Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?
Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...
-I just don't know if I can do it.
Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?
Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.
OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-
Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.
I���ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I���d be proud to take.
I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.
And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
Yeah, I never even knew that part of the office existed. [Pam chuckles] Hey, who's that guy? [Jim points to Stanley]
And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says 'No, Jim, here's a way.'
You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.
���Together we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh.���
OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.
It���s pretty great, right? I mean, we���re coming along��� [to coworker] Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis���s timeline
Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer]
I don't think we have to do this again cause it's gonna take a whole. [everyone clinks glasses]
He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
There���s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor ���
It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about?
Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.
But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.
Oh man, it was great. They were great.
Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all.
This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.
Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud.
This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch.
So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?
Oh. You don't have to tell me this.
I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.
[mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?
[talking on phone] You sound tired. Everything ok?
Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.
Hey. I was just about to call you.
Well it���s sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.
What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone.
[walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?
Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I���m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don���t worry, he���s the best in the biz.
And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.
Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.
We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.
Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on.
But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.
Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it.
OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.
[drawing two family trees on a whiteboard] Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through [draws a question mark] delusion.
[leaning against Creed's desk] So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party.
[to Karen] Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole.
Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?
How do you hate it? It's a cake.
Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.
Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.
So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he���s gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it���s not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It���s strange.
Oh do you mean when I get the job?
[grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah. Yeah. It���s a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to...
Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!
Michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative.  Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I've ever known.  Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before.
[nervous laughter] Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months...
I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'.
You are really good at modesty. She���s a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kids��� room. There���s a hippo leading a parade of 500 children���
I guess he can't get any girl he wants.
Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
[turning around to Karen] Wait, are we playing teams?
No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.
Now, wait a minute.  You're not gonna punch a wall, or me, or anything like that if you don't win the point, are you?
The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.
So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so...
Pam, I���m not explaining this to you-- Pam, I���m not going over this again.
By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?
You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...
Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?
Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.
Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?
I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope]
Okay, okay, it's no big deal.  So you're not a computer geek.
It's not even real yet. And I'm not gonna tell her 'til it's real.
I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing...
Listen, this isn't a favor, all right?  This is a good idea. We all win.
Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.
I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.
Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.
And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
You didn't hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?
And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.
And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.  [everyone claps and makes comments]
[watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They've been in there for 45 minutes.
Ow, What are you doing? [Jim fights back]
I'm sorry. This is for a news audition?
But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.
What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing.
Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?
I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.
The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.
Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?
Do you need us for any of this?
You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks.
Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in��� March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so��� [sits on floor]
Uh, by the way. Have you heard Dwight say the word immunity, yet? Because if I can get Dwight to say the word immunity, it might be the greatest day of my life.
It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. [Towards unseen cameraman] Is bold the right word?
I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...
Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.
Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica.
Alright, let's get this started.  I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.
Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.  And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.  Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay.  I believe she thinks she saw it.
You did not have sex with Pam's mom.
Doesn't matter what the name is. Se��or Loadenstein, that's stupid.
I just���really wish there was something I could do. [looks off]
[reading text] Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.
Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.
You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I���m here.
Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--
I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
No. Okay. Um, I���ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
[Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing, Jim imitates her] Can I do something for ya?
She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.
Dwight, come on. Don���t end on a bad note.
Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. [hangs up phone]
Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
Oh, don���t look at me cause I think you���re making a terrible choice.
I'm sorry, did we or did we not pay for a show?
[Irish accent] Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us.  Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.
Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right?
I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody.
The one I have. I'll use the one I have.
Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.
Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.
But you said that you went out with her this weekend.
Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?
Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit...
Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.
I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.
No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.
You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.
I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.
Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.
I don���t know how else to tell you.
Oh, Pam? Can I see you in here for a second? It's important, so...
I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it.[Pam laughs] OK, good luck!
[on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]
Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn.
By the way, they do need an extra day next week.
Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input���
I am gonna need your advice [starts playing loud opera music, everyone can hear it, Creed starts crying] I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think?
Good advice Beesley.  Thanks.  See you out there.
But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.
Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don���t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
Are you kidding me?  We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
Alright, here we go!  You're doing great!  She'll be here soon.
You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.
[Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.
I���m talking to him this afternoon, but don���t get your hopes up.
Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?
It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming.  But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel.  I just can't grab onto him.  It's infuriating.
Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this: umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. [reveals Dwight's purple belt]
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume.  And a moustache.
What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.
Chapter seven: The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.
Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here...
Oh, it���s the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela���s been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.
Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?
Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!
You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do ���opportunities.���
You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.
I really don't know how it happened, David.
[Jim and Dwight sitting next to each other in talking head interview] Go ahead.
You know what?  Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place.  Happy thoughts, Pam.  Happy thoughts.
I liked you better when you were the temp.
I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.
Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?
All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.
We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It���s like everything I did, he just wouldn���t go for it.
Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh.
[using black voice] Good afternoon! [Darryl smacks his arm]
[confused] What? [Darryl points at his thermos Jim has been using] Oh, man! I'm sorry about that.
All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... [to Dwight] what is this?
That is a lie, that is a lie.
Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna���
But what are you gonna do about that?
I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.
Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.
And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
LOVE the hair. [Ryan walks up driveway with blonde dyed hair]
Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now?
[Michael give Jim a 'World's Best Boss' mug] Thank you.
Yeah. You know what? I���ll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.
[On the phone] Right, oh let me just check the pricing list.  Hold on one second...
Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.
[hovering over Meredith's desk] Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.
Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?
We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.
We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together.
Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don���t listen to it at all because we���re at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so���
[seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. 'Soo-ven-yay.' Mr. 'Jacques Soo-ven-yay.' Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me.
Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.
Oh, hey, man. [Daryl walks over to Jim, angrily and stares at Jim] Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview.
Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?
I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.
Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---
How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?
I don���t know. I���ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close?
I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.
What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in --
Dwight, I uh, I have something to confess.
Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?
Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
[Turns off Dwight's music] Whether it's this time or next time.
I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
Nope.  Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office]
Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?
Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.
Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.
Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
Those are like my favorite movies. I didn't really think you could win Desert Island, but I think you just did.
What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life.
Yep.  Yeah.  She's blind, is that a problem?
Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?
You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!
No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five]
Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?
It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven.
That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
Oh, I didn���t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.
I don't really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.
So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.
It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly?
Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head]
Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just...
Well, if Pam says she won���t go, then���[chuckles] we���re gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph.
Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.
If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah.
Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who���s gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.
I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.
Time. Space. Gender. [Dwight mouthing words] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] No, that���s --
[while Dwight and Kelly are arguing] Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
[stammers] I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.
Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...
Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.
Yeah, alright Kev why don���t you come with us?
No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar?
Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but...
Chapter 9 ��� The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.
Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second.
Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.
[after 'the kiss'] You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.
[walks in, see's Oscar, Stanley, Creed and Kelly sitting in Michaels office] Okay, I thought I saw people missing.
Hey! [Runs after her and looks into her eyes] I... [hugs her tightly, Pam doesn't hug back]
[as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.
Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. [laughs] Oh, text message from my brother. 'Pam cool. Welcome to the family.'
Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.
I didn't ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away]
[snaps back] No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand. [half of office raises hand] Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand. [other half of office raises hand]
[starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ...[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.
Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.
Yes! [as other costumed actors come in and join Andy in song]
Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.
Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go. [hands her an envelope with money in it]
He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!
Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.
Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole 'Woody came to life' thing so quickly?
I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?
[to Michael] Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.
Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.
It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.'
You making this up as you go along, aren't you?
Good night, Dwight. [Jim leaves, Dwight continues crying]
Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
We���ll see. You are an assistant who���s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.
[on the phone] Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.
K, Kevin, are you saying ���See the world���? or ���Sea World?���
What is that? [looks at sign that says 'IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.'] It is your birthday period.
Prank! [throws money from Dwight���s wallet on the floor]
I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.
Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.
Yes, he did.  You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.
Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today?
Then you did nothing wrong. We should go.
It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?
Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman.
Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
I really don't know.  How you doing with all this?
God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.
[whispering to Pam in corner of room] So, they know.
Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?
And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green.'
[Meredith's hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?
Maybe we should just wait and find out.
You know, it's getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.
We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.
You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it���s just gonna make you cry?
No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
What's that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don't, because I've got my eye on you.
Pam!  You don't think he'll mind if we take the shampoo, do you? [holds up large bottle]
Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...
What the heck? Is that, uh... [bends down, cuts phone cords with scissors]
I don't know how we'd go about doing that.
Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert���s notebook.
So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.
Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.
Mmm, that's where you're wrong.  I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require.  So, I think we should go get some.  Now, please.
[walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] 'Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.' [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!
[noticing that everyone is giving him a sympathetic look] How does everyone know already?
This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.
I just got a text from Robert California that says ���bring your clubs to Florida���.
Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. [looks at camera] You know what, just come here.
Eh, she's nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
Mmmhmm.  Why don't you start by telling me what you got.
And you went to New York to do this.  So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?
Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.
Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didn't tell you that.
Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.
I didn't say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.
Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first.
Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.
You know what?  Maybe it's in the ceiling.
Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
[glances at Pam] Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.
How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.
You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?
Gettin��� a lot of mileage out of this, aren���t ya?
Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.
Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.
You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good.
Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.
Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
Sorry, man, I can���t focus on zingers. There���s too many potential clients.
Oh, hello Mater. Good news: I've married. Tell Fater. [hangs up] Such a nice woman.
I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.
Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that.
Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.
I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.
Wow. [sees guy at Erin's desk] Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar.
[aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever.
Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.
Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.
I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here.
Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry.
[pumps fist] ...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.
I'm pretty excited about today. I baby-sit Toby's daughter Sasha sometimes. So, she's the coolest kid. She has seen me play with dolls, though, so I don't know how cool she thinks I am.
That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can ..
Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?
Well, then why are you wasting everybody else's time interrogating them?
OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.
Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding.
[to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working.
Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?
Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that. [Dwight smiles at Jim] Really? Smirking?
That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag...[looks up to ceiling where there is a red tape X over Dwight's chair] Oh my god.
[to camera] Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?
So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight
I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So...  I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--
Well there is some bad news.  [accent] There has been another murder.
Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal.
Because you said 'do you wanna hang out'-
So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.
Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.
I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife���
I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] ...no.
That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.
I don���t know how else to tell you, okay? I���m doing everything I can every week to bring home something...
OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
Just give me one second. I'm just gonna grab something to eat.
I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. [behind Jim, Dwight climbs telephone pole] Oh he'll be fine. I made it up there.
What are you talking about? You're not the boss. Andy is. Andy?
Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
No, don't worry about it.  We'll just got double or nothin'.
What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.
Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?
Am I the only one that���s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.
Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs.
Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...
Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?
Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple���s counseling.
Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?
Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish?
Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. God, it's freezing, I gotta go in. You stay though for like five minutes.
I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?
Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. [Reveal Jim behind Quad-Desk] Thank you.
Hey, Phyllis, Do you have any games that you play in the office?
Honestly, I don't mind. [long, awkward pause until thermos is empty] Did you want me to wash it for you or...
You���re not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I���m in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You���ve agreed to this.
That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, '100% post-consumer content.' What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second.
Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.
I like the wild card.  I'm already liking the wild card.
[telephone ringing] [shows note to camera 'It's OK. She'll call back!']
God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...
You know what?  I'm just going to call a cab from here.
Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work.
I���m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You���ve got a regional manager.
Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos.
[singing the intro to The Lion King's 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight'] A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?
Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.
Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who���s excited?
[Jim's phone goes to voicemail] This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.
Yeah. Big sale. Don���t worry about it though, I don���t really care about the points.  I would like a point receipt though���[on phone] Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald���can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. [gets up to give Erin his point receipt]
But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.
Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...
I am not kidding. [shows camera an engagement ring] Got it a week after we started dating.
I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.
No way. Let's do this [crumples post it and throws into mug. Misses.] Oh.
Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?
I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh]
Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
It���s just a list of our names, split into two columns.
Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...
And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.
Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.
Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.
Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...
I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
[louder] ���Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!���
We should help him out. [Jim and Pam each take a French fry, eat it, and then look toward the bathroom]
Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.
Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.
Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit.
You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.
Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.
I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball.  Oh, how much?
That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?
[attempting to move car seat] It's like The Hurt Locker!
We were just kids.  What did we know?
Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
How embarrassing is it? That's not fair. Here...
Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear.
I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?
[looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off]
You know what?  Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition?  I'd love to see that dunk of yours.
[shoe falls while climbing ladder] Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. [grunts] Creed. I was never here, all right?
If this job is in a well, I don't want it.
Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.
What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.
Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about...
You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.
No. I just missed my wife.[Gives Pam a hug and a kiss]
Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves]
I really heard him on that. This one's interesting I'm not really sure what he meant by this. Um, 'Dwight Schrute Privates.' Tough to say.
Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.
A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.
No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-
There is no inner circle.  Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.
I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow���s his wedding day. You can���t be anything but happy on your wedding day.
[whispering] Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?
Check this out though, spin serve. [serves, and Dwight scores] Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...
You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing���none of these people are good enough.
So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.
Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them.
Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
So, how was the resort?  Did you ski a lot?
Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?
I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.
If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --
OK.  You know what?  Here we go. [stands up] Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged.
Oh by the way how's your side project going?
Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.
Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon.
Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.
Ok, he didn't fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.
Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything?
And I found out that there's a bus at 5:00 a.m.
Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?
By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?
Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?
Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey.
And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.
[Jim slams lunchbag on table] I just totally blew a sales call.
Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.
Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six.
How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.'
Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.
Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
You know, I just think you should know that-
Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?
Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so...
I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food.  In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food.
That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?
Okay, here's uh, this is very simple. 'Dwight's Workspace,' nice.
Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?
The big gun thing. [Dwight grabs at phone] Stop!
OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday.
Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now.  Totally.
It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.
[Michael steals the ball] Yeah, Michael. Go Michael. [makes shot]
Okay, 'A,' Halbert. And, 'B,' I think a more appropriate statement would be, 'The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests.'
So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that���ll print out���Hey. Meet your new desk mate.
Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?
Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.
Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right.
[on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.
Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-
Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I'll... I'll finish explaining the rules. Let's... let me explain it first, and then...
The minister just told me that it���s tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
[on the phone] Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs...
Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?
I would love to hear the other mottos.
This is actually a big potential sale, so...
Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out.
I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.
I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that's not happening, I'm not averse to just buying them all off.
You know, truth be told, I think all you���ll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I���m gone.
Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people...
That���s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]
You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn���t know. Um��� actually I did tell Pam and we decided ���no���. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I���m thinking there���s another conversation coming. And, it���s hard to know when that will be.
I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses.
Wow, we're having a little girl.  Oh, man.
Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back.
How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.
Good one? [Toby puts on the lens cover and scurries away awkwardly] That's a cool camera.
Things are a little bit... different here in Stamford. [shrug] It's not bad.
Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way?
As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.
what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
Hypothetically. Hypothetically you were making out in the woods.
OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.
Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.
Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!
Dwight, you can���t just hire someone ���cause they���re your friend.
Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally]
You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
[snickers at Pam's sketch] That is pretty cool.
[looks bored. Taps finger on desk. Head falls to desk]
I'll just leave that suit in your office then.
Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.
Dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level. And he apparently has a girlfriend, so... I guess there really is someone for everybody.
[sitting on a stack of paper] Yeah, well, if you're only free till three on Sunday and I can't get there till one, then it's gonna be pretty tight.
It's not--- It's not about me.  I mean, this your dream.
Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --
My charity is the Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's Department, because Dwight's a Volunteer Sheriff. So I thought this was a perfect opportunity to support/mock him.
I don't know because I everything I own is there.
Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better.  I only slack off when things are good.
Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
He���s got a bank vault. That���s a start.
Okay. But what is he more famous for?
Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me
Cool. Thanks. [puts his hat on Erin's head]
David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.
Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.
Andy ��� this whole idea of our situation being just like war?  It���s just not true.  We just work at a paper company.  And you���re our regional manager.  And guess what man?  You don���t have to prove anything.  We like you as regional manager.  Andy if you don���t believe me take a look at what���s on my head.  I���m wearing a very pink hat.  I���ve been getting weird looks all day because I���m pretty sure ���DM does GB��� means something kinda sexual.  But guess who���s wearing them?  All of us.  Just for you man.  That���s huge.
Wow. And just out of curiosity, how much is it?
It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.
Oh, um. [pulls item from bag and hands to Pam] Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it.
Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.
No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.
No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think.
I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.
Oh.  Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.
That is good. That's it. That's what it is.
Well, you seem to have this under control.
I'm sorry.  She scares me. [walks away, Pam keeps eating]
Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.
Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad.
You know, that's probably not gonna last too long, you should go to a hospital and get a real cast.
All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.
Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings.  Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.
Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.
Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?
I don't know. [looks at Stanley, who took his mug and is drinking out of it] Oh! That's... not... yours.
You want to just make a run for it?
[using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight]
Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten.  Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing.
Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.
Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?
No, I mean, great detective work.  'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?
Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
[ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.
Oh, just somewhere in the Poconos. I was just surfing.
Okay, I can't find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found 'em.  They're here.
Well, Andy has a mug just like that.
Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he���s gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--
[outside] So I'm still in the process of converting the garage.  It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect [opens garage door] for an art studio.  [Pam looks around and then looks at him] Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---
Is Ryan gonna fire me?  I don't know.  I know that I've done everything I can, and I just brought in a huge sale, and... am I insane, or was this kid a temp two years ago?  Because in the three years that he's been here, I think all he's ever done is start a fire and grow a beard.  And it's not even a good beard.
The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes!
Quick question - do you play the guitar?
Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.
Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don't know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.
Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.
[Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.
Pam, Pam, it's time.  Let's go to the hospital.
OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?
Like hypothetically��� if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.
Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-
[goofy voice] Frank and Beans. [laughs] Always makes her laugh.
You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.
Chapter 4 ��� One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.
[Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]
Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works.
I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.
It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.
Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?
I'll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!
Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.
Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don���t want to meet that person.
Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?
You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it.
The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
It's still on a bike path though right?
No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place.
I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.
[reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters.
Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.
Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.
Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
Here's the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because they're set up to do that kind of thing.
Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?
Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. True���[touches his nose] Oh no.
Oh, it���s happening!  Let���s just keep it between you and me for right now.
Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?
That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. [Jim sees Roy and trails off]
But there is a reason why I'm here!
You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.
No, you're not reopening the case.  The case is closed.
No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.
All right, what the heck? Let's do it.
No, I did that before, it added nothing.
Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. [Pam nods reluctantly]  And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date.
No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done.
No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay [others enter] Hey everybody!
And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash.
Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
If you want to come back then, that'll be fine.
Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work.
I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really...
Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.
[ahem] You can... [slightly effeminate] You can do it Ryan.
[Pam storms out of the break room] Hey...
I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?
Yeah, who'd have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up; smiles]
Have you asked her what she wants to do?
Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement.
[getting up quickly to silence Michael] No, no. Nope.
Do we all have our copy of 'Threat Level: Midnight', by Michael Scott?
You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.
Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.
Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam.  Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
Michael, can I talk to you in your office?
Oh, great. So we���ll see somebody else���s kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it���s really not that hard to film a video.
I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.
[to Karen] Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. [Karen steps into lake] Yes!
Pam, I couldn���t get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.
Uh, I can't get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can't...
...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but...
Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.
[sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome.
Well, the group tour is now leaving, then.  Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows.  I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.
Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone]
Alright, then I will catch you later��� What do we do now?
But that would make more sense. [Pam sighs]
Alright Pam, alright [gives her hi-five]. Nice work!
I don���t know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I���ve been faced with a tough decision, there���s only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.
[playing Call of Duty] Oh? Someone's left out in the open, taking a little siesta. Not smart. [shoots] Yes! Finally killed you... [Karen's desk is empty]
[Walks back into The Office] Yep, I did say that.
Ah, dinner.  Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.
At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision.
That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?
You should ask him. It���s a color you would never expect. [Dwight storms off] Too easy.
[Creed takes toy from toy drive box.] Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy
Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you [in a more and more seductive voice] and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? [Kevin gets up to join the 'hot' team to their great joy] Does that end the debate?
Oh yeah, how long's this meeting going to last?  [Stanley mumbles, looking at his watch]
We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?
Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.
Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool.
You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, I'll just be in, you know. [closes door behind him to supply closet]
Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met...
Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.
[to Michael] It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
[after Darryl eyes him drinking from a thermos] It's mine. Don't worry.
It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-
Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.
These are actually forks and knives from the break room.
Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
Barely, I... I don't have all the facts.  Frank and Bean...
Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine.  So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along.
[Opens folder and reads from Dwight's file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.
[Gets up and looks out Nellie���s office window] He���s running!
If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I���this will be so huge for our family.
Okay.  Sshh.  I know.  [hands the baby to Pam]
I mean, do you like it? You having fun? [Andy snorts, unsure how to answer] Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun���.and you did that.
No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.
Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing.
[tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no.
Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?
Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.
By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.
I'd hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70's theme party, or a 70's theme meeting, or a 70's theme convention...
So, the plan was seven minutes.  But we're calling an audible, because that's her call.  Because she's the quarterback.  I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands]
Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone.
No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. 'Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall.'
[answers phone] Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.
So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
Oh yeah.  Wait 'til you get to know her better though.
What about music?  Do you have any music?
I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.
What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.
You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?
He's good at his job.  And I like working for him.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this.
What?  I did not do that.  That sounds disgusting.
That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was...[car alarm blaring] was in the...
You know what? I could use a little help.
You���re gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy���s gonna record it. So we���ll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?
[at company picnic] All right, you ready for this?
Is this a bad time to be doing this?
He plays guitar, he likes naval history. He's a bowler.
Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago.
[laughs] Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or...
Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.
���Gotta go! Darth Vader's launching a huge attack.���
Okay.  That is me, but I didn't order the cake.
Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything.  And mastered the violin.  Oop, and sold more paper.
Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.
Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.
You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
Okay, the limo���s gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready ���cause I want to pack in a lot.
I need you to breathe in my face right now.
Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen...[Jim bites his lip again] You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!
[on phone] I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
Oh Dwight, Dwight, [Dwight pukes on his back windshield]  Ohhhhhh!
15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
Good. I like it. You know what. Pretend to smoke. [Dwight pretends to smoke]
Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.
[cell phone rings] Excuse me, one second. Hi.
We were... I think she was just trying to-
Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?
Andy, can I talk to you for a second?
No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal.
If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
[on the phone]and I���m back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?
Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.
It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird.
Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.
Toby? Mm hmm. [looks back to Michael] I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...
No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
[Jim and Pam approaching the wedding venue] Is this his house?
Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one [holds up paper]. Originally given by Benito Mussolini.
I think she'd be a really good salesperson.
[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm excited.  Oh, definitely.
Well, Pam I'm not gonna lie to you, he's chances are none. Um, he's 41 years old, he is losing his hair and his cell phone ring is 'Mambo #5.' So...
[on phone] Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a...
Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.
[on cell phone] Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.
Now, this is the projection over three months?
Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just...
Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly.
Wasn't it...  It's kinda like a...  Like that.
Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We're going to the hospital now.
Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.
Well that's great.  [shakes Ryan's hand] You're talking about your court ordered community service?
Yep.  No, I mean I really liked it.  I thought was uh, a fun read.
Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?
Come on, Gabe, you can���t handle his hamstrings. You���re getting hypno-thigh-zed.
Bye. ��[pause] Yep. See, you���ve still got to press ���End,��� Pam.
Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger.
Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?
I don���t know, for such a crazy number I���d like something pretty crazy.
I think today was a good day to have two managers.  'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing.  But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy.  It's because they're doing it for the kids.  And I get that now.
OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.
Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it... [being pulled away by Pam]
Oh, my God, thank you. [hugging both] Thank you.
Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.
Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.
Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular.
Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
[sounds of a car crash] What was that...
Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.
[explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it's a tradeoff.
How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill.
[as Dwight tries to take paper out from under him] Hey, can you not?
Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.
Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. [Andy hums Six Flag ad] Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?
Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted.
You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,
No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom.
Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything.
Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why.
And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--
Today's a big day.  Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  It's got shag carpets.  I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting]  She's gonna love it.  Right?
Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the... [Jim bites his lip again and pounds on table]
Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but it's always buried behind like a ton of black licorice? [points to pile of candy] Bought it all. Now it's like red city in there. So, enjoy it.
You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.
Do you really have to do that right now?
[on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.
I really felt like I almost lost her, and���and nothing is worth that.
Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?
Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just��� we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.
[in unison] I do not think that is funny.
I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?
[on voicemail] Hey, it's Jim.  Leave a message.
Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.
Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?
That's a good one. [a red sports car drives up] Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?
Okay, you know what, Dwight. What if you got a really serious disease like Ebola.
No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.
Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.
Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.
DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
I���m on the phone. I���m on the phone.
And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.
Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90.
Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.
Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood.
So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.
Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
All right, I am connecting and ... you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this:  Go to applications--
No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it.
You know, at the end of the day, it���s really only two days. I mean, I���ll be back in the office. ��If you need me for an emergency, call me. ��I���ll be there...
Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?
I bet I should. [takes cell phone photo] That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you.
Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.
So, I guess I'll see you in [looks at watch] ten hours.
Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
[sings Olympic theme song] This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.
Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?
My god, I���m so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.
I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?
[as Andy and Kevin shout 'yeah!' in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.
Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?! [Kelly and Erin screaming as Dwight bashes their heads together, everyone attacking each other and yelling]
You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
Dwight. This, [picks up balloon] fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?
Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good.
We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.
Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.
[sees a pole poking out Dwight���s pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight's wallet]
Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.
Where do you want to go for dinner?
And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
Three, two, one! [pulls sheet to reveal Christmas tree]
And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it.
Well... yes, that's probably what it is.  So what do I do?
OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?
But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.
Um, thank you, Ryan, uh, I don't know, I think I made the mistake one day of telling someone that I like penguins, and here we are.
Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.
Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Oh, okay. Oh, do... that's what the tape is for. I didn't know.
Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.
Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into?
I���m taking some time off from work���well, my other work���because we needed it.
We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.
Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe.
Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else.
Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?
Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write?
Really?  Do you wanna get back to that?  I could go.  I should go.
No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What���s up?
You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?
What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? [Pam laughs] Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.
Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?
Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.
When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?
Jan didn't come back for her car last night.
[sits down next to Denise] So, high school.
I haven���t heard of it, obviously. But I���m out because I am significantly younger than you-
[approaches Roy back at the wedding] There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?
Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.
For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here...
Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.
Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually.  But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers.
Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal.  While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?
[touches headset] Call you right back. What were you saying?
Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?
[front door slams, Kelly walks by] Hey, Kelly.
I don't know. Hey, have you seen my baby?
[yawning] What about an energy drink or something?
Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?
Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something.
[reading screenplay] Bullets are flying everywhere.  Ooo, wait, last page, big finish.  Here we go. Agent Michael Scarn kicks open the plane door with a karate chop.
You can't yell out 'I need this, I need this' as you pin down an employee on your lap!
Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.
How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.
[In Kitchen] We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.
Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.
Well, yeah I don't want to see her get physically harmed, that's for sure.
That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...
Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I���m not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody.
Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I���m not looking south, I���m not livin���.  That���s what I always say.
[on phone] I'll take that down right now.
Love you too. [hangs up phone, Pam sits on a bench crying]
I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day.  So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna.  ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name.
Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?
And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.
Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-
Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of ���Pilot���]
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these.
What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?
OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use [finds a mug] uh, oh -- Snoopy.
So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.
Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, she's so beautiful!  Oh, my God.
New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door���
Oh no, I didn't want to see you.  Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, I'd say it was equal.  So, good to see you...
Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.
Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.
Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend.
Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.
Wow.  I guess word got around.  That's a nice... honor.
Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally.
I don't know. Is it what you expected?
No, I hear what you���re saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?
You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.
Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
���Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you.���
Here we go. [Meredith's phone rings. Jim and Andy groan.]
Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight...
Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?
Well what if we can't do it quickly.
I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.
Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know.
We'll see.  I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.
I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks?
Office romances. Um... [laughs] I think you should probably ask Pam 'cause she's in an office romance, technically.
Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.
Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.
Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-
I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again.
Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
[hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done.
Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic.
[sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.
[in the kitchen] Oh, here's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-
[Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.
[on phone]: Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ...
You know, it's weird.  It's practically a shot for shot remake.
Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more.
Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.
Does the Department of Health know about this?
Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?
[Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell?
You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.
You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you!
Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.
Hey, man. It���s halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don���t. I���m in. Yeah, yep, I���m all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. [hangs up] Yeah!
Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.
We should take a look at those surveys.
Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  I'm glad.  Any real potential there Beesley?
Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.
And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?
Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?
Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight���s night, okay?
Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor.
[Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.
I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.
Hey it���s Jim Halpert.  I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight.  Because I���ve read a lot about this really great documentary.
Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? [points at self] This guy!
We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?
[getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks.
Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.
A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?
Not gravel, obviously. [both chuckle] No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-
Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.
And I don't support her choice to hit you.
And say what?  'Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?'
It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.
Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?
Sorry. I���no, no, no, what I meant���what I meant actually was���
No, I told you I don���t like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.
Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away 'Survival Skills' and 'Self-defense.'
Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.
OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.
Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years.
Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.
I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.
Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. [Jim puts a pencil into the time clock and pulls it out broken in half] We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.
Okay. I���ll see you in a little bit.
Careful...  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.
No, it's not 'ugh.' It is... office camaraderie.
Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?
Nothing much.  Let me ask you something.  It's actually little awkward.
Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away.
Customers have to use the coupon code from the website.  And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.
I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.
I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.
You pet the animals and they pet you back.
Yeah, you don't have to, ummm.  Alright, yes, that's not gonna be awkward at all.
Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.
[Reading Pam's palm, while she has on extremely padded gloves] Wow, that is really interesting.
Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don't. Riveting.
I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy.
Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?
Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so... [imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles, Michael comes over by Jim laughing]
That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.
Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in 'Shagadelic, baby,' at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright! [knocks on side of truck]
Are you not gonna put out the torches?
Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage...
No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.
Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?
Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes.  Tadah!
Shut up, you, shut up!  This is the dumbest thing we've ever done.
I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  He's winning.  I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.
You see that?  I'm pretty sure she's...  Hi.
No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair.
Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.
Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.
Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.
No, no. I want to hear you tell it.
Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?
Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...that's it. That's really all we were looking for.
Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play?
Well, then I guess you���re ready for this. [gives her the Christmas card]
Huh. Well, you know, you can���t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what���s most important. That���s my new thing.
It's a killer new dance move. [re-enacts leaning back] Do you wanna talk in your office?
Well it���s not that easy. It���s kind of sometimes difficult.
You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager.
Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.
Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
Nah, I think it's mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.
They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.
There���s actually not a rule that says that.
Yeah, I didn't think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.
[Jim and Pam are walking outside] I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.
Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
Alright. Let's clear this up. [on phone] Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?
I'm going home, and I'm taking my baby with me.
Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.
Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, 'I don't own an Ebay store,' so...
Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else.
Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us all to believe that he was the father... by telling us he was the father.  But then we got this e-mail from Jan.  [waves paper and reads from it] 'Hi, everyone!  Jan here, writing to share some wonderful news and to quash a rumor.  First, the great news - I am expecting.  The beautiful baby inside me will be ready to meet the world this fall just a few months before the launch of the new Serenity by Jan line (shameless plug, I know, don't hate me, LOL).  Anyway, I also wanted to clarify that the father is not anyone that you or I have ever met.  Remember, no matter how excited someone is about my baby, it does not make them the father.  Best, Jan.  P.S. Hope to ship you something soon.'
Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.
What about a gift basket full of cash?
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Uh, what does -- what does that mean?
I ain���t fraid of no ghost. [Pam holds up drawing of a hand with the middle finger raised] Whoa!
Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.
[wearing a tuxedo] I don't know. Is it classy enough?
Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?
All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.
We tried to find the fairest way to do it.
Okay, guys, guys, guys. That almost sounded like business, and we are trying to focus here today, okay?
Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.
My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this.
I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here: Michael handles more of the 'big-picture' stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...
I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.
Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?
This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -
Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
I love you.  Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!
You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.
It's true. I'm having a party.  I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up.  [sighs]  He is very real.
What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?
Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?
Well we all want a good party, right?
Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.
Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?
Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.
I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!
Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.
Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
Actually, I have the certification number right here.
You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
Ok, um, this is��� [leaves DVD with her]���I���ll be right back.
Only if you tell me what you're writing.
Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office]
Alright.  I'll tell everybody here that you say hi.
Yeah, definitely didn't need help with that, but, yeah.
I have to.  Pam, if I'm not there, someone's going to go to jail.  Or die.
[trying to hide from Michael what they're doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]
[to the buyer] Hold on a second. [to Pam] The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about���
I forgot if there was an 'e' between the 'l' and the 'y.' I still don't know.
There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?
Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.
Yeah.  [Jim leans in for a kiss but Pam turns away]  She's fine.
One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.
I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!
I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.
[Dressed as Dwight] It's kind of blurry. [puts on his glasses] That's better. [exhales] Question.  What kind of bear is best?
That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.
[demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.
What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
[shakes Michael's hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.
[to Pam] I'm so sorry for all of this.
We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.
I saw the movie. I just don't know every line from the film.
Yeah. [Pam puts her hand out for an earbud] Definitely.
A toast, better make it good.  To avoiding a class two felony charge.
Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?
I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise. [taps Bluetooth earpiece] Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.
[Jim moves his head closer and Pam taps him gently in the face] Oh, ok.
So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word 'Philadelphia'?
Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten...
I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!
No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone.
Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
Got it.  They're like the penguins of the airplane family.
Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
You know what, just in case she's looking you should put some stuff in it.
OK, I don���t have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people.
I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.
Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.
All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player.
In the box. [hits it straight into the floor]
I'm not gonna- [cuts himself off, Kevin walks in]
You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
If you could help me out, that would be���
Sure, yeah. [laughs] Hollywood. [Ryan Howard pulls out 3 thick scripts] Alright.
Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.
I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.
Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.
Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.
Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.
Okay, that's insanely complicated and the first thing I'm going to do is erase it.
There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.
Let's be honest, it's not totally my fault. [indicates Pam]  Shared responsibility.
Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again. [Pam rolls her eyes and walks away]
[driving] I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should. [sighs]
[sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?
Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?
Hey, uh, does Mr. Nortman still teach here? He's a jerk, right?
No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.
Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously.
Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to...
[on phone] Hey, Brenda.  This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat.  And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right?  Um, so gimme a call back.  You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one.  Yikes.  Uh... give me a call back, I hope.  I'll talk to you later. Bye.
Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!
���Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA��� Dash JH.
I mean, it's just that- [clears throat] You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you...
What award would you like to give Dwight?
Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
OK, I'm gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael's office] to do some work. So I will be in here.
Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about? [Michael leaves]
I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.
So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.
Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.
So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.
Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.
Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win.
DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island?  Yes! Meredith?
We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
Doesn���t seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.
Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.
Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or...
[On phone in hallway] No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.
[approaching Reception] Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?
[Pam approaches as he sits in his car]  Hey.
Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.
No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...
That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.
Are you sure you once knew how to do this?
So, you used to share that cubicle with Kelly, right?
Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it.
[Michael has a 'sticky-hand' toy and snags a paper off Jim's desk and then laughs] About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.
And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.
Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults.
That's impossible. [Dwight climbs through ceiling hatch] Dwight!
No, I didn't. [Michael laughs] You know why?
Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be
Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?
OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.
Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  We'll be fine.
Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him.  And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.
Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.
Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be...  Can we get a late checkout?  I don't...  I don't think she heard me.
Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days.  How's your summer?
Well... that's not gonna hold up in court.
Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
Cece���s ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I���ve been working with her on her move. It���s called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It���s kind of like this. It���s pretty cute, right?
Good Lord! [Photo of Cece on Jim's desktop] I can't believe I'm missing this.
God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]
Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.
God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?
Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try.
Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.
Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or...
Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.
Good eye - it's an oval.  [Andy compares his arm length to his side of the conference table] You're measuring the table.
Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--
Okay. I���m really sorry I told the guys I���d be there for the board meeting.
Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? [Karen smiles and gives herself away] Wow. Ok. You got me.
Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... [Ryan walks in]
[as he and Pam flip their cards] John Stamos.
[hands Pam Andy's phone] Are there any messages?
Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!
Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind.
No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?
Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...
OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo���s here. Let���s do this. Change if you need to.
I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.
Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.
Do you know the industry is in decline?
This is way more than I make now.
[to Cece] Hi. [to everyone] All right. Travel safe, Angela.
You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.
No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.
Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date.
Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.
She looks at it when she���s on the potty, and she makes the faces.
Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, 'Mom, there's a ghost in my closet.' Now, you say one of two things - one, 'You're just having a bad dream,' or two, 'Let's go see what it was.'
Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.
Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head:  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.
[motions he is on the phone] Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. [comes over] Okay. [sees notebook with two lists of staff names] What is this?
I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
Karen and I are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time. I don't know what to tell you. Right now? Dead heat.
Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.
Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes���and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that���s���an amazing gift.
[swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine?
Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.
He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.
Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right?
Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company.
We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn't do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
Okay, that is a 'no' on the on the West Side Market.
Okay, you could just show up late though.
Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...
No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?
Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.
No, he didn't. [Dwight mouthing 'yes, he did']
So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.
[Philip is crying] I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?
[interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?
Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually.
I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa.
[A note is on Jim's computer that says, 'It is time. Parking lot at noon.' Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]
Ah, gotcha.  Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.
It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.
I wasn't. But thank you. [to Pam] Do you know anything about this party?
I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why.  Interesting.
[Pam starts sipping an empty glass] I think those might be empty.
Ah...[sees Dwight's wallet and open email] I'm gonna s- [see's Dwight watching from break room]
What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...
So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.
OH, that's great. I'm really happy for [starts to walk away]
Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.
There���s a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.
[after tense pause] OK. Here ya go. [roughly hands Darryl his thermos]
Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]
[Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.
These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one.  [Michael stands on podium] Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal. [everyone claps]
Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -
I may have told some people that.  I'm nervous.  I'm about to get married.
No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You're way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.
Hey, you know what? I got you a cake.
[pops back into Jo's doorway] Thanks again by the way.
[In the parking lot, holding his side, walking to the taxi, Pam follows] Oh...what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. [To taxi driver] One second. Oh...
[cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.
Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I���m waiting.
No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So���my pitch is���me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork.
There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.
I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand]  Just the guys.  Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem.  I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.
Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.
So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-
Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen.
I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one.
Don't. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!
Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? ���Guten Prank��� number one.
Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk.
Because it is Halloween. So if you���re going to sing a concert, it���s a good idea to throw that one in.
I guess. [Pam smiles and walks away, then comes back and kisses Jim on the cheek] How dare you.
Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.
I... why don't we go back to this animation.
Well, I think you handled it pretty well.
Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?
Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?
Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
She's wearing a onesie [holds out his cell phone, Oscar leans in but Kelly grabs his arm]
Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on.
And then an older gentleman asked you 'Boxers or briefs?'
The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.
Um, just for the day while Michael's at my desk.
Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.
Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn���t going to show up?
[whistling, places cup of coffee onto Dwight's desk] Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do.
Okay, what was this look? [Oscar does the look.]
I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening.
Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it.
I don't know about Stephen King, I mean...
Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we? [Dwight's phone rings. He crawls into nook under Jim's Quad-Desk]
[on phone] Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. [to office co-workers] Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out. [lowers voice] He said it should just be under an hour, so... [everyone groans] we did it.
Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.
Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.
He brings up two good points.  Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?
[picks a card] It's the four of hearts.
All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to.
So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?
And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.
No, nope. What else? What else? You watch The Hills? What is Heidi thinking?
I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
Yeah... .you want me to come in your office?  Oh.
Thank you, sir. [Tips his glass to Daryl]
I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.
Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips.
I don���t even know where the stairs are!
What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video.  I knew we'd need a back-up plan.  The boat was actually Plan C.  The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago.  Pretty much the day I met her.
Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim's desk and walks away]
I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.
Um... let's see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king.
[shakes Michael's hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them]
I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.
[to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.
Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.
The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says 'You wanted me' enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.
Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.
Nah, you definitely weren���t kidding.  And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. [hands Andy slip of paper]
Yeah, I'd say she's happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8:00 AM.
Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can���t give 100% to two things at once you know.
At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.
Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.
[Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing?
Yeah, I'm aware of that.  But he's also being super annoying.  And I'm not a perfect person.
Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday.  So, keep that goin'.
Hey, Abby. I wanted to give you this for all your hard work today. Look. Michael signed it and everything. Official.
Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?
I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.
Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward.
Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here?
Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.
OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing: I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party.
They weren���t really talking that much about money. They just said, We���re good with investing and then I...and I...
Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.
Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?
Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.
Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.
The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs]
[sighs] I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.
Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim. [shakes head] I got nothin'.
Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --
Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.
Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.
OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me.
Now how do you know how it works?
Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work.
[not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [sic] energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  [David laughs] So that's a... bonus.
It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.
Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs]
OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
[silently counting] Three, two, one... [Erin turns on the office lights, all laugh loudly]
Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!
What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. [To Pam] Hey! How are you?
Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can...
Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? You���re clean, right?
Hey. [Andy pushes things aside and sits on top of Jim���s desk, kicking things in the process.]
Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. I'm gonna find him.
I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.
Hello? [laughs] No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK. [punches button on phone]
[long pause] Huh. This is a little out of left field.
Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.
Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]
What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or...
Are you serious? [starts typing on the computer and Andy begins to lean in toward the computer]
I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.
OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.
OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad.
Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it���s a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...
Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses.  Uh, four dollars.  And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble.  And that's a grand total of... [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars.
Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.
[holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound]
Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
[watching baseball game on TV] Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out.
Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. [Everyone talking Phyllis pours Jim some eggnog, as Daryl walks in] Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?
Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.
Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?
I'm gonna help you through it all right?
Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
[after Pam has another contraction]  That's seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.
I promise you, we don���t need a warning-
Thank you. You know what, screw this! [pulls Pam into a big smooch]
This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.
You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?
I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.
Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.
Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again?
Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.
[seeing Cece gone from the couch he left her] Uh, MeeMaw, where's Cece?
Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.
When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.
Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on. [to everyone] Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. [to Katy] Desert Island. Five movies. Go.
Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for.
So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky.
Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.
Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.
OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
[motions for her to follow him] Come on.
Okay. All right, come on. [picks up Cece from Pam, whispers to her] Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip.
Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.
You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.
Does it save time though? ���Cause we���ve been here for about an hour.
Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time? [Abby nods]
Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.
[mimicking Stanley] I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. [holds up same book] I've only sold one copy.
Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?
Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.
Hey, come on.  Let's go to the hospital.
I think that's the question that you had...
You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.
Michael went in there with him too.  It's pretty sweet.
You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. [both laugh]
[scoffs] I... will never say a word.  And now, we are even.
Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.
[On the phone with Dwight] Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.
And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand. [Michael, then Dwight raises hand]  Can I get you some punch?
Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!
[on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.
Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies.'
I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything. [laughs]
Not enough? I don���t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it���s against the rules but I���m gonna need a favor from you guys.
No, No, we'll just board that up.  It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.
Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?
[Dwight imitates the 'Jim face'] Look at that.
And I took it right back. It was like...
But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.
Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight.
How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
Ah, well I think I'm gonna see Katy.
Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates...
Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah.
You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
You're only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but.
Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?
[a text tone goes off] Is that my phone?
If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?
Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?
Oh good, so we don't have to work.
Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.
[talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?
OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.
Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types]
Cece���s really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird.
No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?
It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.
Oh, there's no game.  We're just trying to get these chips for Karen.
Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think.
Let me guess, you think you should get it.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?
I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.
Well I���ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn���t believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.
No- Ok. Well, we'll talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?
All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.
I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.
No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not...
Okay, you know what?  You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.
This... is Parkour. [turns laptop to camera, shows Parkour instructional video] Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. [Michael is shown climbing/walking on various objects in office] The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.
Okay now really think hard about this one:  One year.
No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back.
I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- [hears door, hides]
Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.
Oh!  See I'm here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
You know what it���s not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
But it���s Dwight who���s bring in all the weirdos.
Oh, Somebody went in. That was a team effort, Pam.
I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?
Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.
Not important.  Because you're not dating her.  Because it's a felony.
I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.
But there's definitely a desk open in the back.
Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.
[Carol walks through door looking upset] [waves] Carol.
It is... more of a spicy brown, actually.
A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?
You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
[both laugh] You know that I was doin' this.
It���s Ryan. ���I���m sorry. I lied. I���m not in the bathroom. I can���t do it. I need to see my mom. I���m going home.���
[to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay. [runs]
Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?
Oh man, that's crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.
Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?
I just didn't, you know, want a deal.
That's okay. [Hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby] Oh, no, it's not. I'm sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?
Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause. [group agrees, protests]
Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!
Dwight, you wrote that memo. Okay, it's not an official memo.
Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.
Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.
I looked at you coming around, and I said, ���Wintergreen.���
No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right?
I'm just kidding. She told me about it.
Hey, so this isn���t matching up with this���and I���m not sure which one���s right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?
For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin���
Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?
I feel like a stranger in my own country.
I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?
So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.
Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?
[on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.
[presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]
Hey guys let���s just all admit it. Ok? Dwight���s better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he���s never, ever going to go back on it right?
[enters breakroom] Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.
Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we���re scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix ��� me asking the boss of the company I���m abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash.  So��� problem solved. Thanks, guys.
Yeah. [Shot shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse]
Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.
Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?
Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes.
Today.  Now, maybe.  'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.
Okay, you know what?  I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?
No, you what, seriously, you should have it.
That might be a little difficult with the one computer.
I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap.
Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.
That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.
Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.
[on the phone] Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great. [goes into a private room where Pam and the doctor are, the voices are inaudible, but the camera can see through a window, Pam and Jim look in shock, they hug and Jim goes back out into the hall to call Dwight back, trembling] Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs! [laughs] Ohh! [goes back into the room to hug Pam]
Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.
I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.
You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
You know he's doing all this on purpose.
[peering nervously through conference room window] Oh, I don't have anything to say. I'm just hiding from Dwight.
I missed you. [they embrace and kiss as Andy watches on sadly]
Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
[waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?
I don't know though. I mean, you know that was a hit.
Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left.
Ok. Well, hey, you're not here. You don't know, Ok? It's intense. They made me eat black licorice.
What was my worst first date?  Umm.  It was a couple of years ago.  It was a lunch date, actually, it was right down here, at Cugino's.  And we had just met, and we really hit it off, it was, it was kinda nice.  Umm, huh.  And, uh, then, as it turned out, it wasn't even a date, because she was actually in love with someone else.  So, best first date is also my worst first date.  Oddly enough.
I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now.
What? What am I gonna do? I don���t ���
[to Jordan] Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.
You good?  I'm just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...
Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker.
Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.
Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.
[collects Dwight's weapons from around the office; holds up a hand scythe]
Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.
Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
It's my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello?  Well that's great. [hangs up phone]  Turns out the paper was there all along.
Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.
The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
[holding up a sign that reads, 'Dwight picked the wrong day to put a wooden mallard in my office']
No, let's let her rest.  I'm sure there's still twelve on each.
Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we���re just starting couple���s counseling. Uh, which doesn���t sound any better.
That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it's a murder.
Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we���d save her from Ryan right?
[shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.
He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.
Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
Yeah, was it 10? Yeah, I have it on a mix tape from junior high.
Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while.
[on phone]  Hi, yeah.  This is Mike from the West Side Market.  Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah.  You have 'em in the warehouse.  Great.  What is my store number... six.  Wait, no.  I'll call you back. [quickly hangs up] Shut up [to Karen].
You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.
No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so...
Alright, I���m gonna go warm up the car.
What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?
When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.
[sighs] Hey David, how would you like a guy who���s not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?
Nope. Can���t accept that job. It���s not a real job.
Well, you know you can't actually poison him.
Why don't we head in your office to talk?
19. [grunts] I had a really hard work out this morning.
Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer.
I [drops out] at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please don't call again.
But that doesn���t matter. This does. It���s the only thing that matters. We���ve had some really nice days together.
And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]
Oh my God!  Wait, this goes back two years.
[driving, sighs, laughs] No. you know what? No. Because... I'm not that guy. And [laughs] we are not that couple. [turns around]
This, man. I can���t do this to Pam.
How would that work in well?  I just want to know.
Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
It didn���t have a buster sign around him?  Why don���t you draw him?  Why don���t we see this whole thing.
Nope, not a prank. I think it���s time for you to bury the hatchet.
Can I just talk to you for a second?
Oh, [clearing throat, deeper voice] Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh...
Right in the sweet spot. I think you���re gonna be really happy.
[hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down]
Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we don't need a new system though.  Happy with ours.
That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker.  And a great number two for the office.
Okay alright. [gets up] I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.
[Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.
Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-... [Jim bites his lip]
All depends on the conference room meeting itself. [phone chimes] Uh, okay.
Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you���d ever set foot in in this town?
Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?
Oh. Adorable, right? [opens kiddie bathroom, sees man on toilet] I walked in on someone in the bathroom.
No. I can't. It was like, hours ago.
It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out.  We're not going under.
[laughs] I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um... [nods]
Take care of my wife. I will be back.
[Jan enters the office, pushing a stroller] Jan.
Get in the car? [Jim and Pam get in the back seat]
Toby and I used to sit together until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much.
Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.
Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up.
[taking away Dwight���s handset] Go ahead David, I���m listening.
Go bag's in the car...  Keys, my keys, where's my keys?
And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.
That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
Oh no, no, no. That's ok. [Jim shoves some snacks in his pocket as he gets out of limo] Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center?
Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?
I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] 'Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.'
How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?
Yes! Phyllis! [claps] Phyllis, just put your foot right through here [lifts strap on box of paper]. Right through the flonk.
No, see? Right there, that���s the problem with your method. ���Cause I still don���t know if you���re saying ���Sea World��� or ���see the world,��� and it���s taking a lot of time to explain it.
Okay! First of all, stop using my name.  And second of all-
So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.
Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.
Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping]
Oh, great. [reads] 'Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy.' Oh that's not good.
Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea.  Let's go out.
Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who���s the strongest? Well, there���s only one way to solve that ��� flat curl contest.
Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?
Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?
Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.
Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. [Michael and Dwight enter] Guys?
So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?
You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.
Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?
[laughs] You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office]
Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, it's totally hypothetical.
Who wants Phyllis as Santa? [most everyone raises their hand]
I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money.
Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?
Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.
[long pause and then he sighs and nods] Yes.
Mad?  How could I be mad?  We're having a little girl.
He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
[Michael, Dwight, Andy and now Pam are in the circle and training their 'weapons' on each other, Jim walks in]  Really?
Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
No he doesn't.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...
I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.
You did not force me to do this.
Well, I mean, I don���t even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so��� These things go down all the time.
It's Mose. Who do you think it is?
I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.
The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... [shrugs] Oh well.
Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.
Sure.  Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-
[as Pam stares at him] I can feel you looking at me.
[entering office] Hey. So, we saw a new billboard.
[addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you.
[Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah...
We need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it]
And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?
You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading 'Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!']
Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
Is that really how you want to get this job?
Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy.  Thank you.
So, you just couldn't take it anymore, huh?
Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.  [someone dims the lights, signifying that it's game time]  Ok, see you next week.  Bye.  [to Karen] Again?
Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]
Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?
Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this���
I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then... [reading text message] 'How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight.'
Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?
Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.
Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.
Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything.
Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman.
Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.
No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
[chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.
[laughing]  Um, you know what?  I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell.
Let's go driver! [clapping] Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...
Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you���re not the best with the phone.
[hushed voice] Uh yeah. Trust me, I���d rather be with you guys.
So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.
No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.
I have one, too. Jim. Jim, Is Jim. My name is Jim.
[goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait.
Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?
You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.
Uh, I think you dropped this [hands over piece of paper]
Mm, hey driver. Why don���t you take us to 3030 Adams?
You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?
What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!
[on phone] All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. [hangs up the phone and rubs his eyes] Whoo! [Erin jumps in the background]
And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to 'Happy Birthday.' And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.
Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.
Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?
I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
Okay. There���s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.
Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.
I was just... I'm in love with you.
No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.
Well, we���re here. Perfect. ��[covers sleeping Phyllis with his jacket]
Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.
That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.
What? [looks in box] Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?
[on phone] Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background]
Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.
Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings]
Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
By the way, man, this place is... beautiful.
Ah, let's do it. [laughs] Oh, that's healthy.
Andy, we're gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.
I'm just killing Germans, any way I can.
Michael, look I'll just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.
Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?
You should actually thank Erin, she's the one who agreed to babysit.
All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this.
Pam and I are good buddies.  I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.
Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.
Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He���s putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I���ve done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight���only good surprises. ���Guten Pranken���. [chuckles]
You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?
Alright, let's conference room it up! [everyone is now in the conference room]  Here's the deal guys.  There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.
What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.
I've had a Foreman grill for about six years, I've done about 85% of my cooking on it, but I've never burnt myself, probably because I don't use it as a pillow.
An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?
He's not a part of this. You know that.
Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?
All right. You know what? ��Maybe we���ll just... We���ll go slow.
Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
One more.  Why are you talking like that?
I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...
Well, it could happen. Have you ever seen the movie Outbreak?
Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?
Andy, it's the last day of the quarter. We've already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.
Well, I promise you that has nothing to do with it.
I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.
[Gently taps Pam on the forehead] Tied up.
[gives Dwight a thumbs-up - mouths the word] Good.
Psst. You think this thing's gonna go much longer?
Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.
I had plans to meet a friend tonight.  Which I had to cancel.  But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer.
Um, you know what, I actually didn���t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.
Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.
Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.
So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
Look, Pam, I don���t know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It���s gone. That moment���s just gone. I missed it.
Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands - including Pam]
[to Dwight] All right. So... I guess this is it.
[on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.
Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen.
Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.
So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.
Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.
The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.
The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that���s final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I���m not risking that again.
I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too.
Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy.
Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here.
The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
Are you sure you���re okay with me putting in this much money.
OK, here we go... Digest of business terms, CliffsNotes on business economics, and a sales encyclopedia.
Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela.
Getting my wife a week off from work.
You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.
I don���t know what to tell you, man.
Come on, Michael says we should go now.
You know what?  Let's go.  We got to go to the hospital.
Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor?  Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages?  That'd be great.
[sarcastically] Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started. [starts to write on a piece of paper]
I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80's movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I don't do that, I think I'll be alright.
[coughs] Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one!
I can't believe you guys.  I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
[ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?
You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.
What? [Karen's player shoots Jim's player, 'You killed Jim Halpert' appears on the screen, Karen giggles]
Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something?
Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
There.  Now we're even.  [Pam laughs and mimes taking a picture, they kiss]
Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.
Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?
Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column.
Oh! That was really. [Dwight hits purse against table] This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.
Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
And, also, any forms that you are going to need...
[Dwight hands Jim a piece of paper] Oh, what's this?
Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
[on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.
[conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.
Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...
Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I'm gonna need four. [kisses Pam]
Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone.
[on phone] I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
Andy revealed himself to be a double agent.  At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent.  And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent.  Oh, and it is 6:00.
What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.
All right, guys. It didn���t work out for any of us, so��� we���re still on the same team. Let me get these.
Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try.
Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things.
Wow, can we make it a different moment?
Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.
Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.
[Michael playing air guitar on pool table] Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this.
Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It���s really great.
OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' and everyone's just staring at her.
Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.
[to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know.
OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.
I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...
What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!
[sings] Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,
No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!
Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.
Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.
I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--
Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.
Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay?
Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]
Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?
[Overlapping] When's the last time you upgraded your printer?
What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.
You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?
Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
[Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you're going up there?
Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question.
I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...
No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.
I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok?
Not really a question. [starts to laugh] Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk.
Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.
[bounces ball off wall with Toby] So that's what this sound is all day.
So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
[Michael is wearing a wig that is very close to Jim's actual hair, and he is wearing fake earrings, and speaking in a punk-ish deep voice] I totally don't know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?
Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.
Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?
This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.
Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim.
The next year he really stepped things up.
That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.
I have no idea.  We went right for the copier.
Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
[dictating to Pam] Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
Come on man, just give it a couple days.  I think you'll be all right.
All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.
I really think we should join forces on this one.
So beautiful. [Pam's starts to cry.  Jim pulls up chair to sit next to her] Hey--
Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.
Michael's birthday. It's pretty fun to watch, actually. He gets very excited, and then he eats a lot of cake. And then he runs around the office. Then he has a sugar crash in the afternoon. And then he falls asleep. And that's when we get our work done.
Guys, what is going on?!  [Pete and Tom burst out in laughter]
You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
Mose has been weird? That���s so unlike him.
Oh, man, I���d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?
That���s obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.
Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises.
No, I won't.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.
But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
[As he's walking out] That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!
OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...
Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires.
[time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?
Ahem. This is for you... and [puts blanket around her shoulders] ...Happy Birthday, Kel.
Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.
Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?
All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.
Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.
All you're gonna need to [faking a bad connection] and-  it- and then go to--
You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?
Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.
[in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff.
We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.
I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.
I think that's probably all we need to hear from...
Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore. [Dwight follows red cord through office past Phyllis' and Stanley's desks]
You cut more than you had to, didn't you?
[he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!
I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it���s good for the environment too.
Sorry it didn't work out. Hope you find what you're looking for.
All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-
With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number.
