What is happening right now?
Oscar, how are you on that side?
Party looks fun doesn���t it?  Everybody seems to be in there having a great time.  So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
Mmm hmm.
All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair.
All right, what the heck? Let's do it.
[on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.
What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life.
There is soda inside.
No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.
Alright, let me turn on some music.
[looks at a three dollar bill]
Here we go.
Ooh!
Essential.
Um, [gives Pam a look]
Pam, don't worry about it.
[sitting on a stack of paper] Yeah, well, if you're only free till three on Sunday and I can't get there till one, then it's gonna be pretty tight.
Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
It's getting late.
Nope.
Alright, well, we're never leaving the house again.
[on phone] Hey, Brenda.  This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat.  And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right?  Um, so gimme a call back.  You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one.  Yikes.  Uh... give me a call back, I hope.  I'll talk to you later. Bye.
You sure?
Good, how are you?
[whispering to Pam in corner of room] So, they know.
���Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.���
Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.
He plays piano?
No? Come on.
We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It���s like everything I did, he just wouldn���t go for it.
No.
It's a lunch thing.
Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole 'Woody came to life' thing so quickly?
Okay.
Alright...
You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
[laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
Uh...
Yep.
Okay... [changes back to Glee]
We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on.
I did not see this coming.
Okay.
Nothing.
So, not prison.
Really?  Power gel?
Michael stop. [sprays Michael, then Dwight]
Fair question.
[to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay. [runs]
Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?
Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
I don't know. Let's break up.
What?
No.
That's because Mark's my roommate.
Yeah.
Any luck?
[off camera] Yeah, that's right.
That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I'll... I'll finish explaining the rules. Let's... let me explain it first, and then...
[to Karen] Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole.
Hey. [Andy pushes things aside and sits on top of Jim���s desk, kicking things in the process.]
Okay.
What?
Everyone. Everyone just keeps looking at me.
Where are you going?
Hey.
Um... I don't think so.
Yup.
What?
... MICHAEL!
What do you want?
He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.
Right.
Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.
Great. Let me just...
[turning around to Karen] Wait, are we playing teams?
Forward, definitely.
Mmm-hmm.
So good.
Nellie
Hey, Dwight. What's up?
That's pretty funny.
Get out.
Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.
All right. [laughs] Awesome. Cool.
Umm, what happened?
Nope.
It will be Angela.
I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.
No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What���s up?
[on phone] Hold on one second.
Yeah, I do. C'mon. [they hold hands and cross street]
[mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?
Great.
Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.
Does the Department of Health know about this?
[Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.
Why?
Ding dong.
What about you?
Do you really have to do that right now?
I'll just leave that suit in your office then.
Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?
[whispering] Would you please stop that?
Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?
Well, this is William M. Buttlicker.
Don't-
Oh, yeah.
Alright.
OK.
[Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course
Um... yes.
See what?
[on Bluetooth] Testing, testing. Hello, everybody.
Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?
Okay, you know what?  You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.
I don't know, I don't know.
You gotta be kidding me.
There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.
No.
I bet I should. [takes cell phone photo] That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you.
Have you ever seen a stripper before?
Stanley, please, this is serious!
Whoa.
No way. Let's do this [crumples post it and throws into mug. Misses.] Oh.
Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.
I didn't say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.
Not really a rhyme.
Okay.
I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.
Okay.
I thought we had that looked at.
Big day.
Dave.
What's going on?
That's okay. [Hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby] Oh, no, it's not. I'm sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?
Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
Hey, Toby!
What's that cooler?
Still nothin'.
Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that.
I play.
[as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.
Ok, ok, ok.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Guys, what is going on?!  [Pete and Tom burst out in laughter]
Six. You?
You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.
I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that's not happening, I'm not averse to just buying them all off.
But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
Hey, come on.  Let's go to the hospital.
I'm sorry, Phyllis.
You okay?
I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy.
That's actually a good idea.  We'll all take a brief intermission. [To Pam]  Hey, are you hungry?
65. Ok, no need to laugh.
She does not like him.
You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.
No, no, you saw through me, great.
Hey.
I really don't know.  How you doing with all this?
I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.
Come on, Gabe, you can���t handle his hamstrings. You���re getting hypno-thigh-zed.
Oof. ���Infertility.���
Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?
I���m on the phone. I���m on the phone.
Dwight! [pushes Dwight's hands away] Why?
Where's Dwight?
Sure, yeah, go ahead.
Oh...
I made a sale.
Yes.
Where'd I put what?
[whispers] Is that Nellie?
No, stop it.
We need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  We'll be fine.
And I took it right back. It was like...
No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
Holly, will you marry me?
Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking...
I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.
Wow.
That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.
Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be...  Can we get a late checkout?  I don't...  I don't think she heard me.
Okay.
Yeah.
Because my car broke down.
[Michael in his office playing music loudly, Jim walks in and turns the volume down, Michael trailing off on singing]  We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.
Alright. Let's get started.
No.  You got that backwards.
Do it.
And as you know, I was a paper salesman. [whispers to Darryl] Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked. [group overhears and chuckles]
Can't believe no ones thought of that.
No, No, we'll just board that up.  It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.
Only if you tell me what you're writing.
The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.
You okay?
Yeah, we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything.
True. Meredith.
[grunts] Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?
Umm...
Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?
This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?
Hmm. Doubt it.
You buy a purse.
I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in.
Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
Sure glad you're back.
Ok, great.
So, where are you shipping your foot?
Into a lake.
[on the phone]I can have it to you by the beginning of next week.  Alright? Thanks very much. [hangs up] Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?
I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.
Oh, uh, later-ish.
I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.
Ryan? A little help?
Nice.  That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.
Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.
You okay, man?
No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular.
We could put that in orange juice.
What kind of car does she drive?
What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?
I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.
Yep. [Michael hugs/tackles Jim]
-give him to me and... perfect.
I didn't, I'll look somewhere else.
What is it?
It���s Ryan. ���I���m sorry. I lied. I���m not in the bathroom. I can���t do it. I need to see my mom. I���m going home.���
Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time? [Abby nods]
Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
That's right.
Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker.  And a great number two for the office.
You���re welcome.
Pro-- no favoritism.
Hey.
Just steer more now.
Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast.
[on voicemail] Hey, it's Jim.  Leave a message.
Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?
Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.
Absolutely correct.
Ok.
To both these bears.
No.
Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?
That's OK, we're good.
You are?
Well, you were surprisingly restrained.
No, that wasn't fun.
Hey hey hey. Everything okay?
Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.
[on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.
- two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.
Ayyyy!
Oh, that one was good.
5 dollars.
No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk.
I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
I don't think you understand -
Really? Way to earn it. Hey, Andy?
Wait a minute.
Stop!
...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back.
Oh... lets take the tour Pam.
Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.
Agreed.
Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.
Don't. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator.
What was my worst first date?  Umm.  It was a couple of years ago.  It was a lunch date, actually, it was right down here, at Cugino's.  And we had just met, and we really hit it off, it was, it was kinda nice.  Umm, huh.  And, uh, then, as it turned out, it wasn't even a date, because she was actually in love with someone else.  So, best first date is also my worst first date.  Oddly enough.
No! No!
Thanks, thanks Dana.
Of course.
Oh, hey, man. [Daryl walks over to Jim, angrily and stares at Jim] Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview.
I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
Yikes. [everyone gasps]
Sorry. Man. [Pam hesitates and then leaves]
[time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?
Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.
Sure.
Ah! [Harry walks in]
Uh, hmm. [thinking] Uh, hmm. What else?
[Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.
Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
Yeah.
Oh no, I didn't want to see you.  Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, I'd say it was equal.  So, good to see you...
Yeah.
What? Pam!
And a man.
Yeah.
Will do. [hangs up]  I'll stop calling.  [walks into lobby]
Mm-hmm.
Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit.
Okay.
No.
I can't. I just got a manicure.
The ocean.
Si, senor.
What are you reading?
Michael...
Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I���m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don���t worry, he���s the best in the biz.
[to Pam] Hey.
Mmm-hmm.
Easy.
Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim.
Yeah.
Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.
Well, I think you handled it pretty well.
It's not on your desk.
Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
Uh hum.
Yes. Yeah.
No.
She's, um, she's in New York. She's at an art school.
How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran.
Eh, she's nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
Your department's just you, right?
Everyone knew some of it.
That's Toys R Us, I think.
[hands Pam Andy's phone] Are there any messages?
I'm driving?
Yeee... (grunts in frustration)
Yes, nice. Good word association
You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.
Okay. All right, come on. [picks up Cece from Pam, whispers to her] Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip.
Members of the office, hear ye.
No... sport.
Honestly, I don't mind. [long, awkward pause until thermos is empty] Did you want me to wash it for you or...
I love it.
Oh. Hadn't noticed.
Yeah, I'd say she's happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8:00 AM.
All right.
Hey! Can I talk you? For a second?
Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.
Ooh, go easy with the shaking.
[waiting outside the bathroom for Pam, he is holding a hand-picked bouquet of flowers and pacing] These are for you.
So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.
Oh, Clark. I���m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.
Hey. It���s nothing. Alright? I���ll text you when we get there. Let you know what���s going on.
I'm good. How you doing?
Loggins and Messina.
Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who���s the strongest? Well, there���s only one way to solve that ��� flat curl contest.
[laughs]
Okay.  Sshh.  I know.  [hands the baby to Pam]
Lay it on me.
Definitely not.
Was it your scores?
Nobody tell him!
Let's start with... your mom.
Yup.
Yep.
And Jim will say nothing.
Is that not what happens when you're high?
I know.
Ok.
Cute, sure, yeah.
OooOK.
No, really, what���s going on?
Oh, I'll walk you out.
Wow.
Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
I'm not going to Utica right now.
Hey. I was just about to call you.
Stop [sprays Michael]
[speaking into the mallard and looking a Dwight] Hi buddy.
Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter.
[under his breath] Nice to meet you.
All right, well it already went through, so...
I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.
Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.
Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...
You, too.
Okay, your move.
Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical.
They are terrible.
You got it.
Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... [Ryan walks in]
What?
No. We're not.
Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?
We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just - [blows air] - all in.
Okay. This is it.
Shoot.
Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.
Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.
I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball.  Oh, how much?
So I guess I'll just... work on my short game.
Do you speak Spanish?
Whoa, whoa.
[naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?
Did you really?
Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
We can talk about that later.
Hey.
She's never worn these glasses before.
Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.
What?
No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please.
It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ...
I'm sorry?
No, no. I want to hear you tell it.
This shouldn't happen at work.
Yes.
Hmm?
Six of one, really.
Sure.
Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
That was slightly harsh, don't you think?
Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]
Yup. That's perfect.
But that would make more sense. [Pam sighs]
Stop right there. I love it.
Yes, absolutely.
[off camera] ...what?
We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
That's weird, if it's not locked, why isn't it opening?
Well, there's got to be an explanation.
You know what's crazy?
Six-month anniversary. What?
Be honest.
Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.
[Windows reboot sound] Mint Dwight?
Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work.
Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column.
Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these.
All right.
No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
What's that?
Kelly!
You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?
I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...
Yeah.
Um...
Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?
I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
Hey man.
[to Michael] Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.
Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?
I don���t think it���s-
I think you're good.  Doing a good job.
They're for her to look at, Michael.
Why not?
What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.
The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says 'You wanted me' enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.
[hangs up Michael's phone, leaves room]
Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish?
Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?
I'm gonna grab her, okay.
Justin Timberlake?
Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second...
Oh, there it is. J1.
Yeah?
Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
Okay.
Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?
How?
Pam, play by the rules.
God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...
I don't think we have to do this again cause it's gonna take a whole. [everyone clinks glasses]
Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.
Puppet.
You know, can I call you back?
Really was.
I know.
[holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound]
Still want that.
This... is Parkour. [turns laptop to camera, shows Parkour instructional video] Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. [Michael is shown climbing/walking on various objects in office] The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.
Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.
Well, A for effort right?
So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?
Um, no.
Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.
Nice. Well, what's it all about?
I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.
Thanks.
Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.
That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.
[Car horn honking] Oh, Roy.
Damn it.
OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... [Pam starts laughing]... spy on our other branch. No no no.
Rank each person individually?
Oh, nothing.
Oh, I-
No, see? Right there, that���s the problem with your method. ���Cause I still don���t know if you���re saying ���Sea World��� or ���see the world,��� and it���s taking a lot of time to explain it.
Are you really sure we should be leaving?
Uh...
Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office]
We got to see Ping.  [Pam nods] And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. [Pam nods] Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. [Pam nods] Which for me, has ruined them for life. [looks at Pam, who is staring at him, nodding]
Yeah, yeah.
Well, that is... because you didn't realize that... I was left-handed.
[stops the watch] One second.
How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
Well, is that it? Or?
No thanks.
Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes.
So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
[answers phone] Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.
No. No.
Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that.
Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips.
Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.
All right. I think that went well.
You cut more than you had to, didn't you?
Hey... What?
Does Mose have nightmares?
Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.
Phyllis! ��Wow.
He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
[pops back into Jo's doorway] Thanks again by the way.
Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.
Oh, OK.
No. Let's talk for a long time.
And you should.
Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?
What are you doing?
So?
I wouldn���t be too sure about that. Just saying.
How many words per minute does the average person type?
Okay.
Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
I knew it, I knew it.
Just keep him awake.
You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
Terrible. Totally unconvincing.
Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.
It says 'workspace'.
Hey, and if you���re ever in Austin...
Oh, man. You remember that, huh?
Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.
Oh. Um���
Oh man, that's crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.
Yes! We do. [opens box] Eclairs.
Ah...[sees Dwight's wallet and open email] I'm gonna s- [see's Dwight watching from break room]
Is that you singing?
No.
Shuckin��� the peas. ��You should go back to the first part, though. You are ��gonna ��cover for me?
Andy? You all set?
Mm... not really, no.
[bounces ball off wall with Toby] So that's what this sound is all day.
I don���t.
Yeah.
Andrew.
How so?
For me, it was.
Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
Well, it's just a movie, Dwigt.
Hey.
Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small-[pointing to Angela] Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!
You haven't heard our theme, though.
Yeah.
Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously.
Sounds good.
It's fine.
Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen?
You all right?
Do you take requests?
No way.
I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.
Then you did nothing wrong. We should go.
That's not okay.
What kind of pizza would you like?
What?
Okay.
[Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.
Oh, my God. Please.
[emerging from the Men's room] Empty.
Let the games begin. [sings Olympic theme]
Okay, you know what, Dwight. What if you got a really serious disease like Ebola.
[over phone] What?
-I'm just gonna watch.
[Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]
Dwight, don't be gross.
I don't care.
Absolutely not, I'm mad at you.
You don't want to arouse suspicion.
Oh thanks, Phyllis.
Haaank. Is that you?
No, like baseball. A baseball team.
Well, the joke was on you.
You know what?  I'm just going to call a cab from here.
Michael, watch the road!
Nice. Third book?
What?
You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. [both laugh]
What? [Karen's player shoots Jim's player, 'You killed Jim Halpert' appears on the screen, Karen giggles]
Yeah, totally you did.
Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.
[Meredith's hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Okay.
What is?
Later, Kev. [Puts French Onion Potato Chips on Pam's desk] Have a good weekend.
No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.
Hi Katy, nice to meet you.
[after 'the kiss'] You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.
You follow him on Twitter?
Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece?
What?
Oh, so that's it?
[to Pam] ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good.
[sees a pole poking out Dwight���s pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight's wallet]
You are not going to believe this.
Who's gonna see us?
Yeah!
[as Pam screams]  Doing great, push again.
Michael.
[laughs] What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?
Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. [pulls up Dwight's game] Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.
[to Pam] A banana?
Really?
Ok. Remember Spider face?
Did you say 'she?'
A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?
Except pass that breathalyzer.
No, that's him.
What do you call it? Schruteball?
[to Dwight] Nice.
In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment.
She's not your grandmother, is she?
Are they looking at me?
She wants it bad Michael.
Sorry. That was a family emergency.
[reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters.
[Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, 'I don't own an Ebay store,' so...
Did they?
One more.  Why are you talking like that?
Is that trash talk from Pam?
Where we going?
Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
But there's definitely a desk open in the back.
What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?
We should go on a double date.
It���s insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I���m stuck here trying to keep him on board.
You gotta have sex with a woman.
Yeah, why did you?
Let���s do it!
If you could help me out, that would be���
Bat birth control
I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
Ha ha. That's hilarious?
All right.
The temp?
Hey David.
Alright. [Andy rolls back]
What?
You know what? Yeah. Have at it.
I���m just gonna call you back. Thanks.
I think that's the question that you had...
Obviously.
Sally.
What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? [Pam laughs] Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.
I haven���t heard of it, obviously. But I���m out because I am significantly younger than you-
What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
You burned
Come on, man.
Left.
Oh, I can do that.
Hey.
[looks at camera] What?
Silence.
Oh my God.
I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  He's winning.  I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.
Go get 'em.
The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs]
And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal.
Well, we���re here. Perfect. ��[covers sleeping Phyllis with his jacket]
No. [Michael gets up and walks into his office]
Where are you going out tonight?
Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?
Half.
I���m really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?
Oh my God, David. That's horrible.
Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
Okay. Do you want me to stay?
Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or���
You have to make the decision.
In the box. [hits it straight into the floor]
But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
It's going to be alright.
Wow.
Not even an exclamation point?
Yeah! [to camera] Guten Prank number two.
Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here?
Uh-huh.
Hey.
Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.
I can always kind of win at roulette.
[to Pam] Wait for it.
Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.
Um...
Yeah... yep.
Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.
Okay, back to the old grind.
How many buttons do you have?
Morning!
Yeah.
Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over?
Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. [Windows reboot sound] Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?
Pam's doing great.  Uh, she's ten inches dilated now.  Uh, sorry, meters.  Centimeters.  And she's also fully faced.  Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet.  It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.
Yeah, sold about forty thousand.
Is that... I didn't know that was your... okay, so we're in agreement, this is not ideal... situation.
Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?
Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
You shouldn't be talking about that.
Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.
[laughs]
[glances at Pam] Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.
Yes, I agree.
It���s from the teapot. Everything you���ll ever need to know is in that note. [Pam reads the card] Not enough for me? You are everything.
We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn't do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
So, terrible idea.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we���re just starting couple���s counseling. Uh, which doesn���t sound any better.
Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.
Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-
Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.
Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's all right.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Yikes.
Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...
Five tickets on the windshield...  Hey.
19. [grunts] I had a really hard work out this morning.
How long is this? [flips through pages]  Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings.
There���s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor ���
Yes, it is harassment and I'm going to be suing the winking face. I've hired the angry face as my lawyer and you will be hearing from him pretty soon.
Good!  What's goin' on here?
I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.
Those are like my favorite movies. I didn't really think you could win Desert Island, but I think you just did.
Congratulations!
Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win.
Why?
Really?
Yep.
Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.
And there's my talking point.
Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally.
I don���t know. He wasn���t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn���t hire his wife.
Okay, will do.
Oh, no.
Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I���m not looking south, I���m not livin���.  That���s what I always say.
Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.  [someone dims the lights, signifying that it's game time]  Ok, see you next week.  Bye.  [to Karen] Again?
Fireball!
Yeah.
Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else.
Okay, bye. [Jim turns back to Julius] So sorry about that.
Wait, what?
[To Dwight] So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?
Mmhm.
Nope, not a prank. I think it���s time for you to bury the hatchet.
Um... it's in Maryland.
Doesn't matter.
You know her name.
Okay, here's uh, this is very simple. 'Dwight's Workspace,' nice.
Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?
I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.
What's up, buddy?
Wait...
No.
Yeah?
Wow. What kind of bike is that?
Well I���ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn���t believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.
How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I���m not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody.
Well... that's not gonna hold up in court.
Yeah. Big sale. Don���t worry about it though, I don���t really care about the points.  I would like a point receipt though���[on phone] Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald���can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. [gets up to give Erin his point receipt]
Hey.
Nice. [they bump fists]
I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...
What's what?
Ok great.
Nope.
[gives Dwight a high five] Great.
No, don't be.
Oh, you don't want to know.
Oh, that's good.
Yes it is.
That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
[office phone rings at Jim's desk] This is Dwight.
Competent.
Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.
Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.
There it is. Alright.
I don't know what you mean.
...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but...
You know, try sending them another invoice.
No, thanks.
What are you talking about? You're not the boss. Andy is. Andy?
Ok. Good talk.
[Creed takes toy from toy drive box.] Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy
So Andy is in rare form today.
Let's take a look. Nice.
One second 'cause that sounds really good. Is jackass one word or two? [Dwight sighs] One, right? 'Cause, 'cause of the show, it's one.
We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.
[to Dwight] What are you standing for?
Really? Does he do good work or--
Ok...
Are you kidding me?
Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? ���Guten Prank��� number one.
Was that your mom?
Oh, okay.
Ok.
Ok.
But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon.
Thank you Angela.
No.
We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.
Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.
Alright, then I will catch you later��� What do we do now?
I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too.
Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right?
That's not what I meant.
You really want to do this?
I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--
It's the lever on the side.
You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.
What are you doing?
Well, that was quick.
No, was it good?
Oh, come on, Pam.  I-
I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves.
Are you sure?
You have a toothbrush.
Four months.
What are you watching?
Well, there is no inner...circle.
: Uh, is that it?
What are you talking about?
OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.
All right. Name.
Right.
Stanley. Uhh��� you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!
This was my decision, not yours.
Just one.
It's Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that.
I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?
So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?
[to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know.
This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.
Oh, this looks promising.
Really for like how long?
Absolutely not.
I saw him two minutes ago.
M. Night Shulman?
I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.
[flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?
Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'.
Resent you?
No, I got it.
And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
Why?
Really?
Hey Dwight.
[Jim gets down on one knee]
You're only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but.
I... why don't we go back to this animation.
It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
Tom Cruise!
Um, this one interesting the power comes from the font in this one. 'Schrute Space,' very medieval, very England. Um, this one's forceful, this one's very Dwight. 'Quiet! Dwight Schrute Working,' it's good.
Nope. OK.
As a hostage.
The future mother of my children.
No, I don't think I can...
Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
[overlapping with Pam] Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed.
I think she wasn't wearing a card.
[interrupting] Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right? [tosses black licorice into trash]
I... Why would you just say something like that?
Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally]
Yep. [shuts door behind him]
What?
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by]
Well, in an ideal world...
Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?
I'm gonna go to my desk.
Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.
Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
Feel better?
Are you sure it doesn't hurt?
Pam.
Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
Do you mean vibrate?
Ready?
Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...
Yeah, yeah.
You can write a book about chairs.
Si.
That's about it, yeah.
And that's all?
Hey, Kelly, it's Jim.
That's okay.
Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90.
[Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah...
Oh, are you firing Creed?
Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you!
I think I know the problem.
Are you sure you once knew how to do this?
What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?
Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.
Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?
what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?
Um, like stapler tennis or something like that.
Okay. [keeps eyes open]
Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.
Dammit Dwight!
That's what who said?
Yeah. Totally.
Ah.  That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them.
[partially blown up balloons on table and hanging from streamers] Are you kidding?
Well, the grass is always greener.
Hey... [reveal Dwight's Mega-Desk]
Yikes.
Let���s hear it.
No, I don't.
Really?
You're gonna have to talk louder.
How are you, man?
Nope, just going to see Pam.
Can I go?
[enters restaurant with Pam] Hey, Brian.
Not much what's up with you?
[grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.
Oh... Good.
Hey.
You���re the best.
[whispering] Here he comes, shhh...
Oh, Aunt Phyllis.
No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard.
Yeah.
Did it!
Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.
Wow. Are you that bored?
And I am always busy.
[sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.
What is that? [looks at sign that says 'IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.'] It is your birthday period.
Thank you very much.
I understand that.
Why'd you do that?
Alright.
I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.
Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
Unforgivable.
I thought you had already... left.
I know.
Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...
Which Spice Girl?
Wow.  You look--
Nobody!
Yup, coming. [opens door] All right.
Hey.
Dwight. This, [picks up balloon] fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?
Oh, thank you. I've been working out.
Michael...
Wow.
The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty.
Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore. [Dwight follows red cord through office past Phyllis' and Stanley's desks]
Missed the last part.
Probably just Kelly.
Oh.
Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?
Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.
You're creeping me out.  I'm gonna go.
You are?  [Andy hisses] A cat?
You'd actually move to Scranton?
Alright...  Hey, did you change?
[points at bearded man] Who's that?
Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.
I know.
Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
Oh, it���s happening!  Let���s just keep it between you and me for right now.
No, that was unbelievable.
Let's move on to the next.
Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
Angela.  Nope.  The ashes.
Yeah, I'm aware of that.  But he's also being super annoying.  And I'm not a perfect person.
No, I didn't. [Michael laughs] You know why?
Andy!
By the way, man, this place is... beautiful.
Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
Wasn't it...  It's kinda like a...  Like that.
You know, truth be told, I think all you���ll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I���m gone.
Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans!
[Pam starts sipping an empty glass] I think those might be empty.
Hey.
I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why.  Interesting.
Maybe put up some shelves.
I'm pretty excited about today. I baby-sit Toby's daughter Sasha sometimes. So, she's the coolest kid. She has seen me play with dolls, though, so I don't know how cool she thinks I am.
[singsong voice] Who wants a hot chocolate?
Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.
Okay.  Um... Got you something.
No, I really don't want to.
Yeah?
Do you?
Really?
I am, too. Let me show you.
Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date.
How many shoes do you need?
I think I left my wallet in your house.
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry.
You know, man, it's really you're call.
Couple of times.
I'm on it.
There is no inner circle.  Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.
Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.
Hmm...
Ok.
What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing.
���Gotta go! Darth Vader's launching a huge attack.���
Oh, cool. [opens his plastic bag]
Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.
Just--Just--Hey!
Alright, thanks alot, David.
I don't think so.
Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?
All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, that���s-- that���s decorative.
Great.
I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...
Cryogenics. Beer me five.
That's okay.
Don't. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!
Oh, I didn't know you knew her?
This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
I got this. [taking Katy's bag from Michael]
No one wants to be you, Dwight.
All right. ��Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues]
What award would you like to give Dwight?
Uh, by the way. Have you heard Dwight say the word immunity, yet? Because if I can get Dwight to say the word immunity, it might be the greatest day of my life.
And that's why it's on my desk, Phyllis; it means a lot to me, and now that I know it was from you, it means even more.  Moving on!  Uh, ok, so that's the end of the tour for now, and if you liked it please tell your friends: 'Whenever you're in Scranton, visit Casa de la Halpert'.
No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think.
Just do it.
Hey, how's it going?
Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?
Flooded.
Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in��� March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so��� [sits on floor]
Okay.
Pretty good.
[looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off]
Yeah.
Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.
[not watching Mose]  More spins.
It's okay.
Great.  See you upstairs.
Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.
Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul.
Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?
No problem.
Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.
Ok.
So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word 'Philadelphia'?
I���m very sorry.
Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. I'm gonna find him.
Hey.
That's-
Okay, you know what?
Wow. What have we got here?
Is Ryan gonna fire me?  I don't know.  I know that I've done everything I can, and I just brought in a huge sale, and... am I insane, or was this kid a temp two years ago?  Because in the three years that he's been here, I think all he's ever done is start a fire and grow a beard.  And it's not even a good beard.
OK
We can go.
What?
Hey.
Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? You���re clean, right?
Jim Halpert.
Okay.
Oh! That was really. [Dwight hits purse against table] This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.
Really?
[Walks back into The Office] Yep, I did say that.
Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?
It's my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello?  Well that's great. [hangs up phone]  Turns out the paper was there all along.
Come on, get inside.
Billy Joel Rock Band.
[on the phone]and I���m back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?
Baquette.
[overhears loud monster noises] Its Monster dot com.  Singular.
What?
You know what you should do? Take a vacation.
Pretty amazing.
Okay, sorry, sorry.
I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.
What?
I know.
Do you run the bed and breakfest?
And that's what I told him.
OK.
Hypothetically. Hypothetically you were making out in the woods.
All right.
Is he you?
[on phone] I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
No.
Are you... interested in her guy friends?
Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...that's it. That's really all we were looking for.
Second.
Uncanny.
Yeah?
Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
Really? Not Slytherin?
It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.
This one taken? No. Good.
Hey man.
Definitely.
It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.
[peering nervously through conference room window] Oh, I don't have anything to say. I'm just hiding from Dwight.
Yeah. [Pam puts her hand out for an earbud] Definitely.
Michael.
No, why would you think that?
Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands - including Pam]
Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so...
No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.
Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen.
But ..
We're gonna go get him.
Oh no, that would be great.
[checks sheet] Oh... Deshaun Williams.
Let���s not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you���re expecting a fax today, please don���t yell out, ���Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.��� Ok? That���s nonsense.
OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' and everyone's just staring at her.
Not that, don't...
I liked you better when you were the temp.
Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.
We just passed the exit for Corcroan.
Why don't we head in your office to talk?
Let's go.
Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.
[laughs] You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office]
[conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?
I love you.  Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!
...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.
[to Karen] Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. [Karen steps into lake] Yes!
Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don���t listen to it at all because we���re at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so���
Right, cause that's what we are talking about.
Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.
How'd you get gum in your hair?
Nice job everybody. Great work.
Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do ���opportunities.���
The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes!
Nnnno.  Uh, turns out, it was just a really bad idea involving fire.  But I think I fixed it.
Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.
[on phone]  Hi, yeah.  This is Mike from the West Side Market.  Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah.  You have 'em in the warehouse.  Great.  What is my store number... six.  Wait, no.  I'll call you back. [quickly hangs up] Shut up [to Karen].
Yeah. Super pretty.
Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving.
Hey!
[Michael has a 'sticky-hand' toy and snags a paper off Jim's desk and then laughs] About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.
Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.
Thanks.
When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?
[opens door to Gabe's office] All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again. [Gabe motions that he's on the phone] 'Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.
Who was driving?
Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.
Alright. I will definitely do that.
No, no, no, Stanley.
[laughs] Um, ok. [thinks but says nothing]
You look great.
He knows what he's doing.
What?
Hey, how's it going?
Hey.
I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.
Good-bye.
Awww, sorry. Did it break?
The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.
You need to let him go.
[driving] I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should. [sighs]
...in your condo complex.
[whispering] Hey.
There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.
What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?
Thank you.
We are doing worst first dates.
So instead, you screwed me?
Uh, uh, ok.
You must be really proud.
Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance.
Oh yeah.
Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think...
You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.
Well, I'm neither of those things, so...
So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
What brings you to town?
On what?
Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out?
Aw, thanks, man.
Um, sniper rifle?
We have discount prices on ink cartridges...
Oscar! Uh, what is going on?
See ya. See ya. [Charles leaves] Bye!
I know.  Yeah, it's...kinda--
Uhhh, the street?
Yeah. I'm definitely going.
I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
Well, I'm going the speed limit. So...
Fantastic.
I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn���t know. Um��� actually I did tell Pam and we decided ���no���. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I���m thinking there���s another conversation coming. And, it���s hard to know when that will be.
Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]
I'm not gonna eat it.
[puts fabric softener into cart] ...What?
The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he���s gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it���s not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It���s strange.
Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. [hangs up phone]
Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he���s gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--
Hey, Toby.
All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.
Oh.
Sounds complicated.
Hey.
And in this case...
No, it's not.
Wow, that is delicious.
What?
And no one cared.
Hey, so this isn���t matching up with this���and I���m not sure which one���s right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?
Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the... [Jim bites his lip again and pounds on table]
You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
Thanks.
No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.
[whispers to Pam] Ok, your turn.
What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
[whispering to Pam] Let���s go outside
All right, good catch-up.
OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
No shotgun... 'cause that changes everything.
Michael, this is a conference room meeting.
You just came up with that.
What?
I love you, too.
I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.
[closes folder] You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?
Really?
Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults.
Thank you. You know what, screw this! [pulls Pam into a big smooch]
Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.
Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
I mean, it's just that- [clears throat] You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you...
[Michael give Jim a 'World's Best Boss' mug] Thank you.
I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. [holds up same book] I've only sold one copy.
Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that.
[motions he is on the phone] Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. [comes over] Okay. [sees notebook with two lists of staff names] What is this?
Oh, great. [reads] 'Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy.' Oh that's not good.
[On the phone with Dwight] Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.
Michael, did you say anything?
You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.
Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert���s notebook.
Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?
You know, it's getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.
Who are you talking to, specifically?
Okay, what was this look? [Oscar does the look.]
Nothing.
Birthday.
Not that I know of.
Come on, who doesn't like a picnic?
Because you've solved zero cases.
Right. Let's do some good.
Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies.'
Hey, Darryl. [whispers in his ear]
[Carol walks through door looking upset] [waves] Carol.
Yes.
[Jim face]
I know, I know.
Oh, there's no game.  We're just trying to get these chips for Karen.
What does Level Red mean?
Second drink?
Who wants Phyllis as Santa? [most everyone raises their hand]
Which we are.
We've been through this.
Okay.
And, um...
[trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
Okay, great-
[goofy voice] Frank and Beans. [laughs] Always makes her laugh.
Right.
I thought that concert was pretty great.
You have a walking buddy.
What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
Closed. [Michael leaves his office, gives Jim two thumbs up, which Jim returns]
I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.
I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!
Ready?  One, two, three...
Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so...
Well...
I don't know, what?
I don't want to go.
Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or...
You what?
Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud.
Well, you seem to have this under control.
Why not?
Wake up. [sprays Dwight]
Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.
Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight���s night, okay?
We were.
I'm gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids.
I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?
[whispers to Pam] Shel Silverstein.
Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.
Alright, there you go.
Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal.  While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?
I bet.
The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.
I... will... [gives up and walks away]
Oh, god, nature, please.
No.
Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?
Alright. Why don't you just-
Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.
Yeah.
Dwight. Dwight. [Dwight's car comes screeching into view]
Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.
What's that?
Wow. Busy morning.
Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.
Did ya?
Mm-hmm.  Okay, great.  Well, sorry.
So...
No, I'm not doing that.
It is going really great.
Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly.
I love you.
I think you're under-thinking it.
Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
[to Michael] Why is Packer back?
No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!
Have you ever seen 'em do that? [walk outside and the parking lot is covered with snowmen]
You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
Did you go to first base?
Oh, hello Mater. Good news: I've married. Tell Fater. [hangs up] Such a nice woman.
[sings] Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,
Oh.
Uncanny. [everyone applauds]
We gotta get him.
Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.
I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?
Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela.
Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?
Hey, it's snowing.
Tell me about the cologne. How much?
Really?
What���s up?
Well, I tried. [Michael laughs]
Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica.
Bye.
Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.
That's a guarantee.
Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can���t give 100% to two things at once you know.
And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.
The big gun thing. [Dwight grabs at phone] Stop!
Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
Is he OK?
That's also not true.
In well?
So what's in the box?
I'm gonna help you through it all right?
[picks up phone] Jim Halpert.
No.
What? What, what, what, what, what?
Yikes.
How's it going, man?
Okay that's five.
Nah. Might as well do it now.
Oh no?
Chapter 2 ��� Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.
Hey, Andy.
OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.
Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.
Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!
She's engaged.
He didn't text me.  [Andy's phone chimes]
Oh do you mean when I get the job?
How did those get out? I'm sorry.
Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes]
You know, it's weird.  It's practically a shot for shot remake.
I'm gonna get a second opinion.
Um... why Kelly?
Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-
That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom.
Actually it sounds like you are.
Did something happen Dwight?
[Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?
Yeah.
No, it's not. I did. Yep.
Pink is the red-
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone.
[telephone ringing] [shows note to camera 'It's OK. She'll call back!']
Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.
He's just mad that we're all having fun.
Yeah, I gotta call out on that.
Good night.
Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.
Yup.
Great!
Yes, he is finally nigh.
Alright. [Jim's phone rings] Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?
Okay.
Eww.
And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.
Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading 'Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!']
Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.
Not even Harry Potter?
You will?  Wanna do it right now?
That is good.
No you don't.
You're welcome.
You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!
We should just go. He's really uncomfortable.
Dwight tried to kiss me.
Yeah.
Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?
And the desk.
Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.
Oh yeah.
That is me. Wish me luck.
You know I have to do this.
Mmm.
I am not gonna do this.
He's gonna throw up.
Michael, just go park the car.
No, it's, it's okay. Okay.
You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.
That was one time-
OK.
Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?
Look, We're in Puerto Rico, so-
No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
I really think we should join forces on this one.
Ransom.
OK.
Woah, you guys going to lunch?
Okay.
You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?
Uh, Michael.
Anything would help.
[front door slams, Kelly walks by] Hey, Kelly.
[smiles, looks to Michael]  Really, nothing?
You alright, Santa?
That's okay, I'll do it.
Anything. You got it.
No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!
You hired him?
Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam.  Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
Are you interested in her?
Ohh...
Stanley, are you listening to music?
[snickers at Pam's sketch] That is pretty cool.
Exactly. You can do this.
Go bag's in the car...  Keys, my keys, where's my keys?
Wish us luck!
Ah, ah, ah. Where's the 'please'? We're not animals.
No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Great work Dwight.
It won���t budge.
Okay. Let's start with the 'I love you' level.
Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
Oops. [hangs up]
Nope.
No, that's Andy's office.
Ha ha ha.
Thanks.
And say what?  'Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?'
Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.
To what?
Thank you, accounting department.
Yup, I guess so.
Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much.
I don't-
Seventy and clear, that's nice. Where's that?
Yes. You don't love Holly.
Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?
Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? [Karen smiles and gives herself away] Wow. Ok. You got me.
Yeah.
[walks in, see's Oscar, Stanley, Creed and Kelly sitting in Michaels office] Okay, I thought I saw people missing.
I guess I will swallow my truth.
There's like ten green ones.
Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
Yeah. Yeah. It���s a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to...
You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks.
No, no, no, no, no. No.
Take it easy.
My God!
Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.
Hello?
You didn���t force me.
Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?
Oh. Is that like your new thing?
Dwight!
Aaah!
OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.
[Jim and Pam approaching the wedding venue] Is this his house?
[Michael walks in] Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets.  Do you want to-
Go.
Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
[after Pam checks her cell phone] What's going on?
Yes. Right now? Yes.
Again.
And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
[places pipe in mouth] I am Popeye!
I���m taking some time off from work���well, my other work���because we needed it.
Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair.
I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.
That's alright.
Six point five days. [winces as Kevin smacks him on the back]
Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?
Because it's a surprise.
Uh, yeah, ream.
I���ll take five.
What's up, Meredith?
You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!
Who will be watching the children?
No I didn't.
How much weight have you lost, Dwight?
Cece!
Mm-hmm.
I'm trying Phyllis. You're Santa.
Oh, I'm engaged to Pam.
Oh.  Let me get it.
A formal warning, seriously?
Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it.
Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it.
Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...
[to camera] Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?
You are really good at modesty. She���s a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kids��� room. There���s a hippo leading a parade of 500 children���
But you hear the baby crying, right?
OK, sure. Let's do it. [Pam laughs]
No no no!
OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.
Yeah that's true.
Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...
Yes.
[whistling, places cup of coffee onto Dwight's desk] Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do.
I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- [pulls out a pie chart] How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.
Yeah?
All right, good stuff.
Those flowers are nice.
Excuse me.
Enjoy, enjoy.
Yeah, no, I don't think you can.
I don���t know what to tell you, man.
All right, let's run it back.
Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first.
Kev!
Lucky us.
Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.
What?
Oh, there he goes.
Good luck.'
Was it?
I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.
You're welcome.
I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.
Okay, I���ll do it.
No. [re-enters bullpen from kitchen.]
No, no, no, definitely, definitely.  Yes.  Next weekend, then.  All right!  I love you, too.
Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?
Have you asked her what she wants to do?
Am I the only one that���s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
Big deal.
Hmm.
Wow.
Stop. What?
I am not kidding. [shows camera an engagement ring] Got it a week after we started dating.
Oh-
No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith���s face.  And if that  makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.
We were just kids.  What did we know?
I would love to hear the other mottos.
That's cool.
Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
Oh, I just mean if you, if you didn't lock the door, then we could be upstairs where it's warmer.
Pam.
You got it.
They do?  So, cars are flightless airplanes.
Excellent. Go for it.
See how easy that is?
Unfair. When���s my birthday?
All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.
No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.
Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it���s a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...
I did... say that.
Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?
Why did I transfer to Stamford?  I think that's pretty obvious.  I got promoted!  And you can't beat that view... right?
Totally reasonable.
What?
Oh, OK.
What are your top five cases?
I get it.
Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.
Definitely.
Nope.
What a horrible, horrible movie that was.
Permission denied.
Ok, he didn't fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.
Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine.  So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along.
Hey, Kev.
Phillies fan, though, right?
Dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level. And he apparently has a girlfriend, so... I guess there really is someone for everybody.
Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?
Yes, beautiful girl in the front.
Mm-hmm.
Michael. Michael.
No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...
Dwight, should she be our manager?
Goggles?
Pam, it just happened.
You pet the animals and they pet you back.
Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
[walks quickly to break room, opens cabinet and finds mugs of Oscar, Creed and Phyllis]
Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
Can you give us a hint?
OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?
Sure.
That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
Wow.  Um, ok. [pops Dwight's orb with scissors]
Come on.
You're doin' great, buddy!
Ponies.
So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.
You look great.
Oh, my God, thank you. [hugging both] Thank you.
That���s why it���s so clean.
Umm...
[Jim's phone goes to voicemail] This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.
Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
Pam?
What does that mean?
[aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever.
That���s all right.
Could go either way.
Okay.
You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, I'll just be in, you know. [closes door behind him to supply closet]
Why is she here?
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
Why would you start so high?
Okay. But what is he more famous for?
You knew it the whole time, buddy.
So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.
Well guys with girlfriends don't.
So Pam was right?
I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it.[Pam laughs] OK, good luck!
What is it?
[enters breakroom] Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.
Okay, okay...
Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and we're basically there.
Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.
Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.
You didn't hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
Good.
Oh my God...
[clearly just humoring her] No... way!
Did you cry?
Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.
What is that?
And, also, any forms that you are going to need...
Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?
Tell me about it.
I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.
Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.
[snaps back] No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand. [half of office raises hand] Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand. [other half of office raises hand]
You writing your name over there?
[slinking out of the room] Alright, you are welcome.  I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.
We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.
You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.
I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?
Oh, tomorrow, that's gonna be tough 'cause I already laid out my outfit, so...
Oh yeah.  Wait 'til you get to know her better though.
Hey man. [Dwight hugs Jim and leaves]
So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.
What? Yeah, right. As if.
What is it?
Hey, hey. Okay.
Oh, I actually talked to my wife and we���d really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor.
Okay.
Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
You're an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-
Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It���s really great.
I don't know though. I mean, you know that was a hit.
Thank you.
You have a better idea?
Good to see you.
If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I���this will be so huge for our family.
Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up.
Was that it? No, that wasn't bad.
If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...
But he did, right?
One.
Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday?
I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?
It's stupid. It's, it's just office pranks.
Whoa.
Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
[Irish accent] Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us.  Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.
[On the phone] Right, oh let me just check the pricing list.  Hold on one second...
[on phone] Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background]
A formal warning... [chuckles]
You making this up as you go along, aren't you?
This is dangerous.
Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.
Oh.
You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
[on phone] Hey!  You busy?
Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.
No.
[Pam storms out of the break room] Hey...
[to Pam] Are you cool to just hang out?
Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.
Oh, my God.
You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.
Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.
Phyllis says the same twelve clich��s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.
OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad.
What? What?
Oh.
You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also? [Pam nods] Yes we will be doing that. We'll be getting a dozen.
No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this.
Nope, it's because it's genitalia.
Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.
That���s so great!
Good Lord! [Photo of Cece on Jim's desktop] I can't believe I'm missing this.
A costume?
[in office] Are you sure?
Oh no, no, no. That's ok. [Jim shoves some snacks in his pocket as he gets out of limo] Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center?
Yeah.
Nope.
Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case���let���s get to work.
Sorry.
Yeah?  ...  Oh.
Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork.
Um, you know what, I actually didn���t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.
Because not everybody knows about the party.
Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!
See ya.
You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.
Alright! Let's do it.
Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?
Hey, you got a second?
Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.
Yeah?
Um...
Love you.
[Pam is asleep, resting her head on Jim's shoulder] Um... Hey.
Because you said 'do you wanna hang out'-
No. She wasn't.
No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I���m gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.
Tickets are 250 bucks.
And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.
And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear.
Really?
I was blue group, so it was second from the top.
Absolutely, yes.
[leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen]
No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal.
Thanks, Toby.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
Hey.
Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-
[to Cece] You want a giraffe?
So what is going on, girl in the computer?
You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
I just didn't, you know, want a deal.
Uh-huh, yeah.  I am.
Maybe we should just wait and find out.
Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad.
Why not?
Why would you do that?
Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?
[cell phone rings] Excuse me, one second. Hi.
I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses.
Ok...
Dwight. Dwight.
I don���t know, for such a crazy number I���d like something pretty crazy.
I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.
Oh my God!
[quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.
Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.
What?
Seems like a nice enough guy.
What's up, Hef?
Yeah.
The empanada guy!
That's awesome.
Aww, nuts. [laughs]
Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it.  We'll figure it out.  We'll be okay.
Oh!
Oh my God.
Okay, let's go.
Yeah, yeah. Totally.
Like a boyfriend?
No.
Well, then keep it.
Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
Not enough? I don���t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it���s against the rules but I���m gonna need a favor from you guys.
Yep.
No it's not.
Let's find out. [starts typing]
Bye.
You mean Kevin?
Well, we're really happy.
Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?
Alright, let's conference room it up! [everyone is now in the conference room]  Here's the deal guys.  There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.
Alright.
Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5:00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes.
Andy... is having a
Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.
I'm really excited to meet your Mom.
Oh, um... .I can't.
I'm going with grape.
Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now?
Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.
Okay.
Where do you want to go for dinner?
Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.
What do we have here?
Oh, one hundred percent.  We all want to see you tattoo your ass.
[to Jordan] Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.
It's pretty good actually.
Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?
Yes.
What's that?
Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.
I thought it was a workspace?
All right.
I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?
What are you doing?
Cece���s really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
Where'd you get that?
A semester?
And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--
[outside] So I'm still in the process of converting the garage.  It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect [opens garage door] for an art studio.  [Pam looks around and then looks at him] Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---
Oh it has losers.
Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over.
���Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you.���
Yeah. I have a question for you.
That will inevitably lead to mocking. So...
Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?
Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.
Got it.  They're like the penguins of the airplane family.
I think they're going to the conference finals.
Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?
What's up?
Dwight, please.
Productivity?  My numbers are good.
[talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?
Ok, so that's a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. It's pretty smart, right? [walks into Vance Refrigeration office] Hi, how you doing? I'm Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.
Nope, not at all.
[using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight]
You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.
985,000,000,000,017.00
Hey.
Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just��� we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.
All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
Do we all have our copy of 'Threat Level: Midnight', by Michael Scott?
Hey, Jan.
Well, the group tour is now leaving, then.  Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows.  I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.
Tony the tiger.  You don't hear that much any more.
You know, it was one day.
Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?
Andy, can I talk to you for a second?
Really?
No, I'm not doing that!
You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.
Oh, yeah, so we���ll just do that later.
Bye, Dwight.
[gets engagement ring from his pocket] Hey...
Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley's face]
Okay.
Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]
[Turns off Dwight's music] Whether it's this time or next time.
Well, that's--
[noticing that everyone is giving him a sympathetic look] How does everyone know already?
Just all the - drama.
Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.
OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.
Ding Dong.
Really?
[sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome.
Flowers.
[to camera, holds up a bean] Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture [walking around the table] of who you think deserv-- who's that? [picture that Michael drew of toby, looks like a monster]
Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...
That is a lie, that is a lie.
Yeah.
She'd be perfect for you.
Mmm.
Gotcha. Alright.
You know what? Let me take Roy.
Not really. I've seen a bathroom before.
All right. And cider.
[at company picnic] All right, you ready for this?
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Funny? No? Nobody laughing?
Yes.
Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing.
Alright.
It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?
Oh, thank you!
Um, what's going on here?
Very cute. [holds out the phone]
No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.
Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.
[picks up phone] Hello?
[on the phone] Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs...
I found Dwight's wallet in the parking lot.
[grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second?
Which one?
And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.
Hey, how are you?
What?
Hey.
Can't do that. Unsanitary.
I don't think that's gonna...
I'll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!
Okay.
Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
I just got a text from Robert California that says ���bring your clubs to Florida���.
Oh, nice. Did you check that list?
Oh yeah, definitely.
Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.
Hmm...
Uh��� yeah, I'm just watching basketball.
Well we all want a good party, right?
What?
All right.
Wow. Oh!
Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.
Ooh! Are you nuts?
[mouthing] So close.
Okay. Sounds good.
You know what, just in case she's looking you should put some stuff in it.
Went well?
Careful.  There is no inner circle.
[laughing]  Um, you know what?  I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell.
Oh my God!
Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.
Hi.
Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again?
Okay.
No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You're way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.
[sarcastically] Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started. [starts to write on a piece of paper]
All right. Take care.
We're going to the hospital, Michael.
Maybe we will someday.
Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
Don't...
Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift]
You sure?
Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we���d save her from Ryan right?
Oh, you know what? I gotta go.
What?
Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.
You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?
Perfect.
Yeah.
Oh. Any team sports?
Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.
Okay. I���ll see you in a little bit.
Yep.  [Maguire keeps swinging]
It's not even real yet. And I'm not gonna tell her 'til it's real.
[cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.
What are you doing?
Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.
[both laugh] You know that I was doin' this.
Dwight?
Yeah, that... Yep, that feels about right.
Yep.
It would look bad.  Sorry.
All the time.
Mosquito.
Anna Maria's.
Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend.
So what did he say? Was it my fault?
Do you know the industry is in decline?
Are you sure you���re okay with me putting in this much money.
Big tip.
-Right.
No, it's not, because you don't really work here.
[enters abruptly] Dwight.
Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?
Because we���re friends.
Really...
You don't even drink tea.
What does that mean?
What's that?
Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.
Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into?
Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
That sounds fun.
Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.
Hey, of course.
He just sent a text...
So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.
Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.
That's good. You know, with the kid.
Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I'm gonna need four. [kisses Pam]
Yeah.
When do we want it?!
I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?
Do ya?
Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I did.
So, as it turns out, Dwight is right. How bizarre.
Let's see it. Show of hands.
Well, you know you can't actually poison him.
I don't know.  He looks pretty scrappy.
Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant.
Fine.
Yes.
Didn't I?
I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.
But, what if?
Ooh, definitely in my top five.
Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?
No. I would've said no.
[shakes Michael's hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them]
I saw the movie. I just don't know every line from the film.
I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] 'Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.'
Okay, just talk.
Oh!
Michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative.  Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I've ever known.  Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before.
That's... not okay.
What?
For this?
They���re terrible.
Yup.
So this is fun.
Yep...
Nope.
No, I did that before, it added nothing.
Hey guys let���s just all admit it. Ok? Dwight���s better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he���s never, ever going to go back on it right?
Hey.
Alright, I���m gonna go warm up the car.
Do they call you that?
Solitaire?
Aww.
Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
Okay.
What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...
Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
Assistant regional manager, yeah.
Wow, I'm really sorry.
Oh, nothing.
Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We're going to the hospital now.
Wait wait wait, who said that?
...talk about it.
Or a gong.
Hey New York, Happy Halloween!
Yes, he did.  You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.
Oh, well, Dave is an adorable baby.
Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?
Yep.
Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?
Second-in-command to Michael.
I���m sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment.
No.
[confused] Okay?
Hum.
Okay.
David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
Oh!
Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?
Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that.
[Overlapping] When's the last time you upgraded your printer?
Yeah.  Kinda feel bad for her though.
What's that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don't, because I've got my eye on you.
Pam.
Oh! Hire a magician.
Whoa. You are a volunteer.
Nope.
[nervously] Pretty good.
Nothing.
Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing?
I can't believe you guys.  I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
Okay, make a commercial.
No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right.
Okay.
Thanks man.
Hello?
[laughs and swings his arm out which doesn't come close to touching the reception desk] I'm always this close.
So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.
[gives Dwight a thumbs-up - mouths the word] Good.
[on phone] I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else.
[explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it's a tradeoff.
Oh, you don't know her.
He does?
Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?
Oh my God, you do have gonorrhea.
OOH! Boom! Face!
Just have Dwight punch you.
What'd you do?
So you like her?
Okay, Dwight��� Dwight��� Dwight, Dwight Dwight!��� uh���
No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
We can order in from Hooters.
Yes.
Yeah.
De class���.
Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.
Yeah, you never know.
That's not how that works.
Oh, man, I���d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
Oh, wow. So cute.
Dwight...
I didn't think you'd notice. [laughs nervously] Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him.
Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
Back door.
Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this���
Hey Helen. Is everything ok?
I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD.
And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?
Nice job, I think you got 'em.
She said lots of things.
When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. ��I just wanted... to go home. ��This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013. ��You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space.
You coming down?
So, don't tell.
Why?
Ooh, easy. That's not it at all.
Aw, it's gonna be the [softly] worst.
Five.
Maybe poison?
Is that Mose?
We can custom make them.
Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.
Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs]
You will never want to leave your room.
Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works.
Which would be me.
Ooh.
So you have the directions.
Thanks for inviting us, by the way-
Oh.  Oh...
Well, congrats.
So let's have it at the hospital.
I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I'm sure you're right.
Oh, but you mean other than embezzling?
Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.
Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
Oh, great. So we���ll see somebody else���s kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it���s really not that hard to film a video.
Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?
What, seriously? What is she saying?
Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
[Group chants along] Pie! Pie! Pie!
Just about... yup. Now.
Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work.
Uh...
Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
We have plenty.
That's what I want.
I will grant you one wish.
How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
You know what?  Let's go.  We got to go to the hospital.
Did you feel like crying?
Nope.
Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement.
[using black voice] Good afternoon! [Darryl smacks his arm]
[Dressed as Dwight] It's kind of blurry. [puts on his glasses] That's better. [exhales] Question.  What kind of bear is best?
Oh, [clearing throat, deeper voice] Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh...
Nope, not doing that.
If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.
Got it.
[seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. 'Soo-ven-yay.' Mr. 'Jacques Soo-ven-yay.' Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
All right. Did he hit you?
Hey, alright.
Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
Um... let's see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king.
Oh, no, absolutely.
Three, two, one! [pulls sheet to reveal Christmas tree]
Wow. [heads toward the conference room]
[to camera] Who is this guy? We are killing it.
Hey.
I'm not gonna- [cuts himself off, Kevin walks in]
Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...
Ok, um, this is��� [leaves DVD with her]���I���ll be right back.
Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. [Andy hums Six Flag ad] Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?
[shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.
I'm just killing Germans, any way I can.
OH, that's great. I'm really happy for [starts to walk away]
Oh, you want me to be you?
To the shame room! [raises bottle]
Oh, wow. That's cool.
I���m gonna try a different spot. Okay?
Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think.
It stopped.
Alright.
Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam.
I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.
Really.
Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
Great, yeah, good.
I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa.
Quick question - do you play the guitar?
There's a little more to it.
Hey, who'd you end up hiring?
I know.  I suck.
Yes?
I'm sorry.
Good one.
I'm not single.
So, we should let him go.
Okay.
No, I....
Okay, someone look it up.
OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing: I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party.
Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
See?
Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
Yeah.
Okay. [Pulls desks apart] Just gotta...
That's harsh.
Yeah, people like me I guess.
Ooh... fancy.
O...K.
Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.
I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?
What did I do to deserve this?
OK.
Bye.
You know what?  Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place.  Happy thoughts, Pam.  Happy thoughts.
And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp...
Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] 'The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert.' Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.
Oh my God.
Yup, it's, uh, four o'clock.
Probably
You are?
Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something?
Scuse me?
That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
I can���t. I have the thing.
Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
Can you grow up?
Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
[picks up the phone] Michael Scott here.
You did approve it?
No, I won't.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.
My bad.
Hey!
I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand]  Just the guys.  Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem.  I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.
Not Night at the Roxbury.
Ooh, me three.
Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.
I just-- what?
Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don���t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard.
Toby? Mm hmm. [looks back to Michael] I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...
So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume.  And a moustache.
Go! Go! Go!
Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to...
Hey.
Don't take it.
Love that one.
You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  I'm glad.  Any real potential there Beesley?
[laughs] I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um... [nods]
Michael.
Two minutes...
You all right?
Sales.
Agent Michael Scarn.
Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?
Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
And!
Okay.
Not my favorite, but...
Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. [laughs] Oh, text message from my brother. 'Pam cool. Welcome to the family.'
So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal.  It's Lackawanna County.  Our whole county.  And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch.  And I could work here for years.  And years.  [groan] Years.
Wait a minute, what is this?
You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?
[to camera] Didn't see that one coming.
Microgement.
Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..
[snorts] Ew.
Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?
What'd you get?
I don't know, dad. I don't know.
We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.
Hey, Dwight. I need your stapler.
Wow.
What���s that?
Or a high school girl. Let's go [mouths 'wow' to the camera].
So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.
Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some fire crackers and they start popping]
Did you just trademark that...
Really?
Uh, I think you dropped this [hands over piece of paper]
Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?
No, I don't.
When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.
Dwight!
Elaborate.
Let me call you right back. Okay.
Yeah!
Well there is some bad news.  [accent] There has been another murder.
And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to 'Happy Birthday.' And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.
Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. True���[touches his nose] Oh no.
That was really rough.
It's broken right, he can't...
Wait. Is this your place Dwight?
I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working.
Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.
Workspace.
I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?
What?  What?
I'm going home, and I'm taking my baby with me.
Well, Andy has a mug just like that.
Michael - [Michael signs] Great.
Here we go. [Meredith's phone rings. Jim and Andy groan.]
And that isn't weird?
Okay, I���ll call you right back.
Yeah. You're right.
Dwight, please.
Ooh.
They think it was Mose.
Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?
Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.
That's really not cool.
Thank you.
Oh.
Oh no.
Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.
It was there when I sat down.
What?
This is impressive.
Wait, you alright?
Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?
Thank you.
Oh, I wouldn't-[clears throat]
Yeah.
Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...
Oh, great.
Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, ' You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.'
Really?  Do you wanna get back to that?  I could go.  I should go.
I'm on the phone.
You called any headhunters?
Oh, but you didn't.
At the Yankees game. Yeah.
No.
No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five]
And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.
Can't you do something about this?
Nope.  Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office]
[trying to hide from Michael what they're doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]
Okay, don't be gross.
Too much now.
Will they still air 'Rudolph?'
Oh, really?
Pam?
Got to be kidding me.
It is really special.
How long have you been a man?
Okay, guys, guys, guys. That almost sounded like business, and we are trying to focus here today, okay?
Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
[hugs Dwight] Congratulations, buddy.
Yeah.
[exhales loudly] Andy...
Yep, it's English, it's 'impossible.'
Where... did you learn all of this?
No, he didn't. [Dwight mouthing 'yes, he did']
What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!
Ok. Well, hey, you're not here. You don't know, Ok? It's intense. They made me eat black licorice.
Go get 'em.
[Jim and Pam are walking outside] I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.
[to Cece] Hi. [to everyone] All right. Travel safe, Angela.
[starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn.  Four seconds.
Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?
Louder, son!
With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number.
I think she's okay.
Thank you. Your mom is a treasure.
Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.
[unbelievingly] Okay...
Oh.
Can I have a raise?
Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss.
Yeah.
Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too.
Kevin Costner.
Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --
Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?
Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
[chuckles] You got it.
Oh! Lots of results.
Still decorative.
MmmHmm...
That's-- [ding] the password. We're in.
Okay. Thank you.
[addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you.
Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in 'Shagadelic, baby,' at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
Do you honestly believe that?
Dead goose.
All right.
You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.
Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?
Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that���s final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I���m not risking that again.
Just...you good?
No big deal.
Whoa! What was that all about.
[to Dwight] Are you serious?
Uh... [looks at Pam]
All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player.
Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. 'Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall.'
All right. Bye.
A what?
[mutters] I know, I do.
I have to.  Pam, if I'm not there, someone's going to go to jail.  Or die.
Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?
[laughs] It���s called Ghostbusters.
If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah.
Oh boy.
I forgot if there was an 'e' between the 'l' and the 'y.' I still don't know.
Kev's out.
Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.
Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything.
Mmm...
Dwight, this is crazy.
Yeah?
Okay. We���ll, just forget it.
Whoops.
You're good... you're good at sales.
Oh, sorry, wait one second.
That's a common mistake.
Come on.
Their bread is very good.
We bonded. We got to- [Dwight starts dropping into the bus on top of Jim]
Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.
By the way, they do need an extra day next week.
I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.
You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
Definitely Grandma.
Actually, yeah.
[long pause and then he sighs and nods] Yes.
Don't open your eyes.
I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
No, that is what I mean.
I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.
No.
Me, too.
Glass of water would be a start.
Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
Well, you're probably dehydrated.
You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.
I'm Jim. [Jim hi-fives Abby] Annnnd... let's sell some paper.
Thank you very much. It was fun.
Yep, Spongebob Squarepants.
I'm gonna say fifty.
But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.
I'm on minute six of this message.
Here we go.
You're breathing very heavily.
Nice job.
Stop it! It's gonna be great.
[laughs] Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.
What do you think of Kelly?
You took the deal.
Michael, not now.
So.
Nope.
And impressions!
Right, the one from England.
Michael, look I'll just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.
Ok, sending.
What's that?
���Together we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh.���
Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch.
Michael, it's really not a competition.
Great.
Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?
[imitating game announcer] You win. [Darryl throws empty can on floor] How good did that feel?
I'm not.
[presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]
Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?
Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.
All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]
Hey, you don't have to...
Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.
Hey it's me. So uh, don't worry. Everything's ok.
Hi.
Alright.
Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second.
Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years.
It was an away game.
No.
What was this? [Makes face]
Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
Alright.
I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.
Nice job, Beesly.
Am I walking out?
No. No, I'm not gonna-no.
All right.
Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.
Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?
No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.
What?
You gotta play along man.
All right, I'm gonna go now.
You're starting your own paper company?
Thanks a lot guys, Good job.
Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything.
No, I didn't.
This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that���s for fueling only. No savoring.
Yes!  Angela!  Please...
Pam, it wasn't her.
Right! [Jim laughs as he answers the phone] Hey, what's up? Everything ok?
Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.
Oh, my god!
No- Ok. Well, we'll talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?
You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
Penny for your thoughts.
What? What am I gonna do? I don���t ���
Leave.
Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.
No I'm not.
Yes.
Um, not neccessari...
I am working on it.
Sounded good.
It wasn't me.
I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!
Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.
Oh, great thanks.
Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That's it.
Personal conversation.  Seventeen seconds.
I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife���
Freecell.
If it's the same thing, then why did you write 'workspace'?
Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
Michael! Michael, pull over!
Okay.
No. It's cool.
I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn���t love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid���wonderful���boring���amazing job.
Oh.  Two kisses.
Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.
OK, I'll call the
Not much.
Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.
Thank you.
I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it���s good for the environment too.
Who is it?
Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.
Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?
Oh good, so we don't have to work.
Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?
That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
Aww, best book?
I tried. He will not listen.
[pushes Dwight's finger away] Just, easy.
Let's give it a shot.
Mm-hmm.
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
That sounds terrible.
Yeah, I never even knew that part of the office existed. [Pam chuckles] Hey, who's that guy? [Jim points to Stanley]
Why don���t you start?
I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So...  I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--
I can see that.
Agoraphobic?
So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I'm saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn't he?
Killer nanorobots?
It���s a monkey.
I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok?
Right.
Brown, shiny, painful bite.
Thanks. [both eat cake]
No, not more than anything.
Oh, great.
You've seen it, right?
Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.
Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten...
Hey.
Wow, that is��� wow.
We'll figure it out.
Michael, we only told our parents last week.
The one I have. I'll use the one I have.
A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.
You gonna wish me luck?
What I���m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I���ve ever said.
Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay.
All right.  Then... it's a date.
She is dating Ryan, I think.
I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.
Okay, maybe we should talk specifics.
Oh my God, there
Oh, don't be that person.
I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.
That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
You weren���t there.
So I guess I can assume that was personal.
Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
Okay.
Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe.
Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
[Phone rings] Oh God.
[to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.
Wow, we're having a little girl.  Oh, man.
And what happens in this one?
He brings up two good points.  Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?
Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
Hm hm.
You cannot take the fall for him.
Sure. Look at you!
Michael, Dwight would like your man meat.
What do we want?!
Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?
You watched it.
And then an older gentleman asked you 'Boxers or briefs?'
Yes.
Wow.  I guess word got around.  That's a nice... honor.
Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?
[Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you're going up there?
Done, right?
Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.
Yep. Cool, man.
Oh.
Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.
Uh-huh.
Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.
I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.
OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
I'm not doing that. I'm just explaining.
You look a little worried.
No. Looks good.
Yeah, what do you think that's about?
God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.
Yep.  No, I mean I really liked it.  I thought was uh, a fun read.
All right.
Wow. Win-Win.
Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
[looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled 'administrative' and 'assistant.'
Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.
So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.
You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.
[walking to his car] Hey, it's me.  It is 5:03.
Alright.
Don't beat yourself up.
Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here.
Love you too. [hangs up phone, Pam sits on a bench crying]
Yeah, we'd never do that.
No, no, dude, no.
[approaching Reception] Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?
Mm-hmm.
No, she's not.
That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag...[looks up to ceiling where there is a red tape X over Dwight's chair] Oh my god.
I am.
[blows a raspberry, Erin looks shocked, Kevin chuckles]
No, Michael.  I'm not leaving the car.
But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?
I was gonna go with this one.
We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together.
And then you go to school for three years.
Uh...
Good.
Those are the books that sum up the other books.
I think you should retrace your steps.
I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
That's it.
That's great
Yeah, who'd have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up; smiles]
No, because of the promotion.
It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about?
Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos.
I don't... I don't think so.
Nah, you definitely weren���t kidding.  And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. [hands Andy slip of paper]
Oh, yeah. She's hot.
Ding dong.
Does it save time though? ���Cause we���ve been here for about an hour.
I bet we would.
[Pam lights a candle] Wow.
Thanks.
Um... Whoa. [picks up ringing phone][in managerial voice] Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm  hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.
Oh yeah.
Or maybe he's just stuck in character.
Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?
So, the plan was seven minutes.  But we're calling an audible, because that's her call.  Because she's the quarterback.  I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
Here you go again! What is your deal today?
Thank you, Dwight.
Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
So...
You sure?
Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.
That was really good, Darryl.
Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing]
Not his mom's car.
Okay, Andy, we need to go. Seriously.
I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really...
Having a great time.
Just check it.
This... is the future, because... This is the past. I���ve been through a lot of issues in my life. I���ve seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I���ve been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause]
Okay, good. Stay right here.
Nice.
Bribery. Nice.
This is actually a big potential sale, so...
The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... [shrugs] Oh well.
Mr. Beesly. How are ya?
That���s not it.
Hey, can you go to IM?
Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
I���m sure he���s just nervous.
No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay [others enter] Hey everybody!
No, actually.
Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or...
Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott.
Absolutely.
I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
And in this room here, if you look closely, you will find out a few clues about who lives here.  Um, he likes biking, obviously, and uh, what else?  Uh, he likes tour guides, I guess.  And if you're very perceptive, you'll notice that he didn't do a great job of cleaning his room [kicks water bottle under bed].  Ok, and uh, that's the tou-
I did, yeah.
Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?
Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.
OK...
A small blonde woman?
If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, 'Well that's pretty premature to think,' but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.
It's not my favorite...
If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
[taking away Dwight���s handset] Go ahead David, I���m listening.
It's hard to tell so far.
Oh, my God. Are you serious?
Right.
Wait, there's not gonna be a shotgun?
Alright, love you.
Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-
Wait, should I have left the car running? [both laugh]
I'm trying, yup.
No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.
Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied.
Ok, say please.
Oh, yeah
Hey, Andy.  How are you, man?
I mean, you were gonna do this without me?
I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out.
[standing outside, dials Dwight's cell phone]
Right? So, uh, let's uh...
But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.
Not gravel, obviously. [both chuckle] No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-
Nope. No.
Fine. Party pooper.
So what do you think?
You know what?
No.
Why's it smell real? [Pam shows him a hidden car-freshener] Ah... good one.
So, this hot chocolate thing.
Things are a little bit... different here in Stamford. [shrug] It's not bad.
You are bleeding through your shirt.
What was?
Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night.  So...
Dwight, I uh, I have something to confess.
No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.
That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right?
Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it.
Hey, hey, come on, language.
Yeesh, how old is this ship?
Well, I mean.
Okay, I'm not doing every number.
Uhhh.  Can't.
How are things?
No.
Prove it.
Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so... [imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles, Michael comes over by Jim laughing]
Hey.
Well, if Pam says she won���t go, then���[chuckles] we���re gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph.
Whoo!
Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away 'Survival Skills' and 'Self-defense.'
Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry. [Pam looks at Jim] Sorry. I think I'm just hungry.
���..breast pain...���
Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go.
Actually, I have the certification number right here.
[On phone] ...W R K.
And I'm telling you, I don't.
It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!
Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20.
None of this is time sensitive.
Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?
Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that. [Dwight smiles at Jim] Really? Smirking?
Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer.
That���s obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
Okay.
Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?
[on phone] I'll take that down right now.
Alright buddy.
Now that sounds serious.
Dwight, it's not a factory at all. Do you have to do what you are doing? [Dwight is tapping each of the bobble heads on his desk and making them bobble]
[after tense pause] OK. Here ya go. [roughly hands Darryl his thermos]
[baby voice] Hi.
Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
Uh-oh.
[as Dwight tries to take paper out from under him] Hey, can you not?
Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people...
Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm...
We didn't have one scheduled.
Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.
Thank you.
Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding.
Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?
Oh.  He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.
[waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?
But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.
Hey, you know what? I got you a cake.
[Michael playing air guitar on pool table] Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this.
Wow. It���s the end of an era.
You paid for it?
Mmhmm.
OK.
Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but...
I don't know.
Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
All right.
Aah! Ow!
[over phone] And Dwight.
Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks.
Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.
Kathy wants to leave our clump?
Please do.
Thank you, Meredith.
I'm just doing my job, man.
You don't have to lie.
This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I'm not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley's tie is really the story of the day...
I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.
Oh. Actually, it's just gonna be me.
Who's that?
Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.
All right. Good to be back.
We're going to Chuck E. Cheese.
It doesn't matter.
Whoa whoa whoa!
No, fake girlfriends are always wrong.
Got it.
Oh my god. That's so romantic.
He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash.
I don't know. Is it what you expected?
Anything. [Dwight begins to fill his new purse] Good. Yup.
Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.
You're messing with me.
What?
Yeah, I think so.
Well, I can't be the only one who didn't -- [sees mugs on Angela's and Meredith's desks]
Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?
Erin.
Okay.
Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?
I'd hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70's theme party, or a 70's theme meeting, or a 70's theme convention...
That was, that was a surprise.
I don't know about Stephen King, I mean...
For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here...
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
So you're not doing it.
You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it���s just gonna make you cry?
Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
Pull over, pull over!
Yes, I���m happy.
Michael?
Oh.
Jan didn't come back for her car last night.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I won't.  But, you will wash and buff our car.
Oh, yeah. Pregnant.
Sure, yeah. [laughs] Hollywood. [Ryan Howard pulls out 3 thick scripts] Alright.
Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six.
The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was...[car alarm blaring] was in the...
What happened to 'Do Not Mock'?
I'm couching it!
You're not going to freak out?
Yeah.
It's a pen.
Yeah, you don't have to, ummm.  Alright, yes, that's not gonna be awkward at all.
Oh yeah, yeah... hope that's okay.
Hey, Ryan. How's it going?
Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back.
Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?
It didn���t have a buster sign around him?  Why don���t you draw him?  Why don���t we see this whole thing.
Ok.
Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Hmmm, I'd say 1 in 6.
Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood.
So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.
You should ask him. It���s a color you would never expect. [Dwight storms off] Too easy.
You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.
[Dwight imitates the 'Jim face'] Look at that.
Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.
We did it.
So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.
This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -
Nothing, just talking.
I gotta go do this.
Office romances. Um... [laughs] I think you should probably ask Pam 'cause she's in an office romance, technically.
You know what?
No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.
Really?
Shut up.
Wow, what do you put our chances at?
Where is it?
That is good. That's it. That's what it is.
[knocks on door] Hi.
Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]
This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, 'just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.'
DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
I love their sandwiches too.
I know.  I love it there.
[holds up card] This one's a map.
[to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with.
You're not having sex.
Ah. You brought in your doll collection.
An Altima or better.
No, I mean, great detective work.  'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?
I doubt that they're sh-
Oh yes. Ever since the storm.
Yeah... it.s scary.
I don���t know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I���ve been faced with a tough decision, there���s only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.
You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?
Dwight! At least aim it.
Yeah, she does like Elmo.
Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.
Ohh! Good-bye.
I feel like a stranger in my own country.
Um, just for the day while Michael's at my desk.
I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video.  I knew we'd need a back-up plan.  The boat was actually Plan C.  The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago.  Pretty much the day I met her.
[coughs] Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one!
Okay.
If I didn���t do certain things without telling Pam, she���d be married to Roy. [chuckles]
You must be out or something.
Hmm���Heda. [alert] No.
All right. We'll see. [to camera] No.
You like it?
Yeah, bigger actually.
You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
So beautiful. [Pam's starts to cry.  Jim pulls up chair to sit next to her] Hey--
Wow.
���And shove it up my butt.���
I think she's doing a good job.
It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.
We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.
I, ah...
How much time do I have?
Amazing. How do I look?
Just cut through it, man, it's no big deal.
I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again.
Thank you.
So now you're writing two things?
Shhh.
Angela, it���s Halloween. You have to sing ���Monster Mash���.
Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don't know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.
Sure.  Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-
Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
What's going on?
Mm, hey driver. Why don���t you take us to 3030 Adams?
[playing Call of Duty] Oh? Someone's left out in the open, taking a little siesta. Not smart. [shoots] Yes! Finally killed you... [Karen's desk is empty]
You're definitely hoarding this by the way.
Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?
Yeah.
It's not really food, right?
What?
Yes, car seat's right there.
Nobody asked, Bob!
Where'd I find what?
You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
Really?
No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
Take it easy.
What?
S'ok.
I'd say like... 10,000 to 1?
Ahem. This is for you... and [puts blanket around her shoulders] ...Happy Birthday, Kel.
Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it... [being pulled away by Pam]
We're gonna get him.
Really? Why?
Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.
That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! It's Phyllis!
No, you what, seriously, you should have it.
Stop! Stop!
How embarrassing is it? That's not fair. Here...
I can't hear you.
[quickly shakes his hands back and forth]
Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!
Yeah?
How far away did you think we were?
Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.
You���re not serious, are you? You didn���t get any of the recital?
Hey.
I actually know a sex model.
...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.
Alright.
Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay?
Ugh.
Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?
You got it, you're so close!
Hey, do you guys have any other games?
Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor?  Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages?  That'd be great.
Yep.
All right!
What kind of offer?
Caleb!
And then we checked the fax machine.
It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming.  But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel.  I just can't grab onto him.  It's infuriating.
He's a grown man
Yeah, I know I should.
What are you doing?
[opens phone] Hey. I saw you called.
Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it.
Why wouldn't you see him?  You work for him.
What are you doing?
[after Pam has another contraction]  That's seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.
I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.
[pumps fist] ...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.
What a night.
Aw, man.
Michael, don't.
Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-
Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?
What is that chestnut?
Nice.
Total nightmare.
Sure!
Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.
All right, you know what? [picks Pam up and carries her off the court] Let's do this.
Pull up your pants.
Is there a limit?
Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.
But if not, there's always the army. The infantry.
Andy, you've gotta be kidding me.
Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.
Yeah, it's a golf text.
Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see?
Umm, Michael.
Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody.
I think you mean The Sting.
Oh?
Yeah sorry everyone else didn���t come.  I think they���re just tired.  With holes in their shoes.  And they have dysentery.
Haha...
Dwight, you wrote that memo. Okay, it's not an official memo.
And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.
Good luck. [closes door and locks it]
Mm-hmm.
Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.
Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.
I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.
David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.
OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday.
[clears throat] I am ready.
So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.
Wow! Congratulations, that���s a really big step.
[after Darryl eyes him drinking from a thermos] It's mine. Don't worry.
What?  I did not do that.  That sounds disgusting.
Awesome.
Get in the car? [Jim and Pam get in the back seat]
He didn't mention me, did he?
Okay. And how do you feel?
Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical.
Smasher!
You could���ve just called that an alliance too, right?
Wow, can we make it a different moment?
Oh, thanks.
I'm Jim, by the way.
Oh my god. That's less romantic.
It's true. I'm having a party.  I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up.  [sighs]  He is very real.
Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because...
Hey, do you have a second?
When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?
I don't know. Hey, have you seen my baby?
Michael.
I think I'm gonna go.
Yeah... .you want me to come in your office?  Oh.
Thanks.
Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands]
Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?
Hey.
It's a real handsome duck.
[to Michael] Will you stop?
[answering phone] Jim Halpert.
Not at all. It should be Dwight.
Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?
1. Here we go! [turns on wipers]
Aww...
Okay.
I'm just gonna write 'held back tears.'
I disagree.
I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So���my pitch is���me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.
What would Bob do?
One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?
[laughs] Thanks Dwight.
What do you mean?
I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?
No.
What?
Is that the buzzer from Taboo?
Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted.
Good. What? Nothin'
Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.
Yeah? [to Darryl] You ready?
Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.
So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.
Cathy, go.
OK.
Yeah, well, you know...Cornell.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
I must...
Yep.
Yes.
Sure we'll go.
Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--
So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.
Oh yeah, I understood.
I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.
[hushed voice] Uh yeah. Trust me, I���d rather be with you guys.
Okay, I'll just go get the other guy.
No.
Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--
She's engaged, um... to me.
Come on, Michael says we should go now.
Let me guess, you think you should get it.
We should switch seats in order to...
What?
Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird.
Isn't that thing huge?
It was pretty uneventful, actually.
I drive a Saab station wagon.
You didn't set up your BlackBerry, Dwight?
You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.
Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it.
Think you can let go?
Well, it's what you wanted.
Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.
Pam!
No.
No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it.
Who doesn't love that?
Nice.
Everybody's birthday.
Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her.
Wow, simultaneous sale.
[brings Michael into his office] So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
Another bullets heads towards Agent Michael Scarn, but he jumps out of the plane without a parachute.
Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. [Pam laughs]
Well, I promise you that has nothing to do with it.
But there is a reason why I'm here!
That's nice.
[motions for her to follow him] Come on.
Good!  Fine!  I've got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee... [dialing phone]
Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.
Hey, David.
Ok, where is he?
Ew, the exact opposite, actually.
I love Star Wars as much as the next guy���
Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool.
[on the phone] Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.
Yup.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you.
Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.
Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?
[sings Olympic theme song] This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.
Got it.
No, not at all.
Doesn't it?
Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...
You gonna answer it?
That seems inconsiderate.
Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
I don't think so.
[interrupting] Volunteer duty.
Well, Dwight's a purple belt, so...
That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.
That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.
What happened, did he do it?
Well, I should hope so. [Michael takes phone] Who is this?
Jonas Salk.
Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
Is this a bad time to be doing this?
And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green.'
Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?
Okay, I can't find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found 'em.  They're here.
We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.
Why are you- How do you know?
Just... quit stalling.
I just feel like we're gonna fight.
A...hot chocolate tea
Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.
You used my move, didn't you?
Cool.
Hey Pam! How are you?
I'm gonna pull the car around.
You see that?  I'm pretty sure she's...  Hi.
Andy, are you all right?
Here they come.
cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
You should take up a musical instrument.
[hovering over Meredith's desk] Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.
Alright.
Yeah, I am too.
That's cool.
Hey, Dwight.
Wow, that's great, because I need paper.
Hmm... Five.
[at the Halpert residence as Cece twirls in the front yard, exiting front door] Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma���s got breakfast, OK? [to camera] We are going to Roy���s wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife���s ex-fianc�����s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it���s your wife���s ex-fianc��.
Is this real? [Pam dumps Michael's screenplay on Jim's desk]
Good!
Wow.
But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.
Ahh, these aren't leads. What are they?
Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.
Alright.
This is Jim.
[listening to and editing Jo's book on tape]
Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? [pause] I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.
[humming]
Thank you.
Yeah, it does, actually.
Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
Ooh, what about, uh,  Dwight's dojo?
She could put the cup right there.
Chapter 4 ��� One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
Nope.
Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.
Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.
Yeah. It���s real. It���s the only way you���ll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She���s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
Okay, you know what?  I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?
I���m not doing the Presentation.
Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, she's so beautiful!  Oh, my God.
You should actually thank Erin, she's the one who agreed to babysit.
I can.
Okay, it���s not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.
That is a mistake.
To waiting.
[whispering] Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.
Truce?
Yeah. Even you.
It just feels a little bit, like...
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.
Our fake winnings
Mm-hm.
Hey Michael.
Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?
Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.
Yeah...
Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.
So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.
You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine.
Pam and I are good buddies.  I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.
I can imagine.
[arm around Pam] Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.
Dwight!
Don't..
Is there some evidence?
Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey.
Andy.
What?
The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.
What's in here?
And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
What happened?
Wow, that's not what I meant.
Hello? [laughs] No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK. [punches button on phone]
Okay, they're fine. They're adults.
And how many kitchens?
What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
[Michael steals the ball] Yeah, Michael. Go Michael. [makes shot]
Uh, yeah, I guess.
Hey, are you kidding me?
Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.
It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.
[baffled expression]
Yes.
What? No, no, it's not a vote.
Don't think you need the corpse then.
Oh. Adorable, right? [opens kiddie bathroom, sees man on toilet] I walked in on someone in the bathroom.
Right.
No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not...
God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]
What about, uh.. [points at Meredith]
Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.
[hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done.
Don't do that.
Okay.
Till Death Do Us Rock.'
Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.
Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.
Puerto Rico was awesome.
Oh, well, that's coming. [smiles]
No, I'm not gonna do that.
So, what is this special project?
You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.
Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.
No way, a 280?
Okay. I can���t say that that���s not fair.
Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.
Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.
Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.
Most apartments these days have like three.
Okay. Thought people read more books.
Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.
Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends.
No.
Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry.
I am Bill Buttlicker.
[Reading Pam's palm, while she has on extremely padded gloves] Wow, that is really interesting.
Ah, dinner.  Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.
Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?
I missed you.
[after entering daycare] Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.
Not important.  Because you're not dating her.  Because it's a felony.
It was not rotting.
Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.
How are you?
Well, he's Florida's problem now.
Not even a thought!  It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!
Really?
It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.
Okay, so what do you want to do?
I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. [behind Jim, Dwight climbs telephone pole] Oh he'll be fine. I made it up there.
Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.
Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Maybe we should both go.
Let's do it.
[sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?
[Pam approaches as he sits in his car]  Hey.
Come on man, just give it a couple days.  I think you'll be all right.
Yeah.
Just like that.
It's not--- It's not about me.  I mean, this your dream.
It���s great.
It���s pretty great, right? I mean, we���re coming along��� [to coworker] Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis���s timeline
So, next interview has to be better.
You���re gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy���s gonna record it. So we���ll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?
Yes?
I think I did a pretty good job.
Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. [Jim puts a pencil into the time clock and pulls it out broken in half] We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...
No, that's not what I-
Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.
Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them.
Oh, excuse me.  It's my... favorite part.
Mad?  How could I be mad?  We're having a little girl.
You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing���none of these people are good enough.
Do I have any say in this?!
Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward.
[to Michael] It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises.
Uh, it's in the lot.
I would like to lose 65 pounds.
[Philip is crying] I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?
You... owe me.
Okay, so--
Yep.
The raise isn't real.
He has not stopped working for a second.  At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work.  It's exhausting, being this vigilant.  I'll probably have to go home early today.
Great.
Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-
That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.
He can't hear you?
Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?
Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?
No.
Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.
Umm... sure.
You need to stop talking.
That is a lot of liquor.
You ready?
Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
You a sports fan?
Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.
I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
Sorry. I���no, no, no, what I meant���what I meant actually was���
Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?
Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days.  How's your summer?
You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.
Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own
Ok, I said average.
Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor.
I miss that.
It was-
I need you to breathe in my face right now.
Just give me one second. I'm just gonna grab something to eat.
Stop shoving me.
Alright, alright, gang. Let's just settle down. You're yelling in her face.
Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.
Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?
That's not what that is.
Uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'Cause otherwise we can't do any work.
I don't really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.
I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?
What have we got here?
[points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.
I'm trying---
O..ok. Um..good.
Merry Christmas Dwight.
OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...
OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-
Hey, uh David.
Nice job, man.
No, not without a 'please.'
Thank you for all of this. This is so helpful. You know what? One last question. Um, who is that fine older gentleman in the corner? [points to Creed]
Okay.
All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... [to Dwight] what is this?
Shh.
[whistles] That���s a lot of pros.
[confused] What? [Darryl points at his thermos Jim has been using] Oh, man! I'm sorry about that.
What's up?
Hey, uh, does Mr. Nortman still teach here? He's a jerk, right?
It is. Big time.
Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types]
My home office, this is it.
Oh, no, no. No.
I'm probably never gonna see you again.
Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, [starts snapping] you're a Jet all the way, right?
No, I'm not calling Karen.
Yes.
Okay, that is a 'no' on the on the West Side Market.
No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so...
What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
Today of all days...
Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!
That's not the point.
All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this.
Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.
No problem.
���Robert, Hey!��� Exclamation point.
You up for a game?
Michael. Am I the first to arrive?
That's pretty good.
OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.
Oh.
We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?
[as Andy and Kevin shout 'yeah!' in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.
Alright, we're driving ourselves, actually.
I'm just kidding. She told me about it.
Sorry it didn't work out. Hope you find what you're looking for.
That did. Pretty huge laugh.
But what have you learned about her?
Oh... my apartment's on fire
All you're gonna need to [faking a bad connection] and-  it- and then go to--
Okay, 'A,' Halbert. And, 'B,' I think a more appropriate statement would be, 'The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests.'
Good eye - it's an oval.  [Andy compares his arm length to his side of the conference table] You're measuring the table.
Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.
Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?
[half-heartedly] Andy!  Nah, that's too far.
Oh, um... [A long silence.]
What's that?
No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
Yes.
Thanks, Charles.
Jimbo!
Wow. And just out of curiosity, how much is it?
All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.
Really?
Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!
And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.
[long pause] Huh. This is a little out of left field.
No, I didn���t notice anything.
Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.
Okay, man, easy.
This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah.
I���m sure you did not. What was your question?
Like hypothetically��� if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.
Pam's sales are fine actually.
Okay, the limo���s gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready ���cause I want to pack in a lot.
Of course.
Damn it guys!
Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?
[In the parking lot, holding his side, walking to the taxi, Pam follows] Oh...what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. [To taxi driver] One second. Oh...
They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
In the fridge.
Oh, I'm so glad you didn't.
Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me.
She's... high-maintenance.
It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right?
Try this. [takes Dwight's 'Asian' race and switches it with the one he wrote]
Uh hmm.
Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping]
I thought you liked the store?
No, no, no.
Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so...
I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.
Ok, this is crazy.
Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? [points at self] This guy!
Oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though.
Just then, Agent Chang gets a bullet in the head.
Six on seven.
I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment,  is the only one who raises her hand]
Nope.
That's what she said.
That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.
To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle.
Dave.
Nothing much.  Let me ask you something.  It's actually little awkward.
It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. [Towards unseen cameraman] Is bold the right word?
What?
She looks older.
[back to Pam] Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.
You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
Alright!
Okay.
He's not a real candidate.
I know. And I can���t do it.
Of course I did.
Hm. Really tough call.
Yeah, alright Kev why don���t you come with us?
Love it.
John Dillinger.
Nope. Not guilty.
You doing alright, man?
[on cell phone] Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.
Yeah. At least for one more dance.
[talking on phone] You sound tired. Everything ok?
What power?
117 Mount Bergin St.
I get back from work around 6.
I [drops out] at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please don't call again.
I'm the one who complained about you.
Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me
Okay.
You can't yell out 'I need this, I need this' as you pin down an employee on your lap!
Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
You really think you can make it up to me with food?
You play? [referring to keyboard]
No? Nothin'?
Dwight, how's the hotel business?
[leave the conference room to address everyone]
OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?
You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
It's all gold.
I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes.  Tadah!
Hey.
[on phone] Absolutely.  I couldn't be more sorry about this.
Left.
That's right.
Mm-hm
No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-
I guess he can't get any girl he wants.
Uh, Larissa Halpert.
Anybody could have walked in.
I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] ...no.
We���ll talk tomorrow?
It���s just a list of our names, split into two columns.
Porque es muy rapido.
Michael went in there with him too.  It's pretty sweet.
Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work.
Why?
Okay, okay, it's no big deal.  So you're not a computer geek.
Which one?
OK, great.
Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now.
Okay.
No way.
Gettin��� psyched up?
I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.
I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
That���s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
That sounds lovely.
I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.
Oh.
Yes, it is.
Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I���m gone.
Still no.
Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, it's totally hypothetical.
But that doesn���t matter. This does. It���s the only thing that matters. We���ve had some really nice days together.
Hey Dwight.
I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money.
I had plans to meet a friend tonight.  Which I had to cancel.  But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer.
Pam, I���m not explaining this to you-- Pam, I���m not going over this again.
Yeah.
Yes.
Good one? [Toby puts on the lens cover and scurries away awkwardly] That's a cool camera.
You look cute today, Dwight.
Forget it. It's just a dry erase board.
What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
[in unison] I do not think that is funny.
The other volunteers.
Mose has been weird? That���s so unlike him.
Kev, have a good weekend.
What?
Yep.
I don't think we need opposed.
Hey! [Runs after her and looks into her eyes] I... [hugs her tightly, Pam doesn't hug back]
She's wearing a onesie [holds out his cell phone, Oscar leans in but Kelly grabs his arm]
[pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
No, no, no, no.
Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.
Yes.
Right. There, first...
We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders.
I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good.
Thanks, Pam.
Oh man. [laughs]
That sounds bad.
Congratulations.
[sits down next to Denise] So, high school.
Awesome, right? [leaves]
I'm so sorry.
She...
Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
Hey, how's it goin'?
You all right? You ok?
I dunno, it's on
Okay. Have you ever seen the movie Sixth Sense? Maybe you are already dead.
No one should be planking at all.
Absolutely not.
You haven't done any of the research.
Cathy wants to leave our clump?
Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight...[motions to lobby]
[Andy playing the sitar] Hey.
That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
[ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?
Well, I mean he humped Michael.
Forget it.
Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that.
But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.
[shakes head]
Nothing... nothing at all... it's all good!
Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about...
Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didn't tell you that.
That's inspired.
Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic.
Today.  Now, maybe.  'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.
[on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.
Dwight, he's gonna kill the store.
[to Gabe] Is it?
Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning.
[chuckles] He's so cute.
Oh my God, Dwight, put that down.
Wow.
How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.'
Too loud.
This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.
Another round, boys? Great. [Jim walks to the bar]
Next stop: Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also.
Is-
[wearing a tuxedo] I don't know. Is it classy enough?
Well...
[while sighing] I suppose I am.
They weren���t really talking that much about money. They just said, We���re good with investing and then I...and I...
Is that what happened to you?
Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---
OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I���m helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I���ve ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong.
Yeah, no one can snap with their little finger.
Oh, thanks man. Appreciate that.
Animalian?
But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.
Oh, uh, no. Could-
I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
Nope. Baskets have it.
We tried to find the fairest way to do it.
What was you? You were the leak?
Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.
Blonde.
Ow, What are you doing? [Jim fights back]
What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.
Okay.
[to Pam] I'm so sorry for all of this.
What?
He's not a part of this. You know that.
Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?
I didn't ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away]
OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.
[shaking head at the camera]
Hi.
Okay... [puts pizza into Dwight's mouth]
Okay, just relax. Just need to relax.
I am not lying.
OK, I'm going back to work.
Meredith Van Helsing?
I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.
Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.
Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
Okay, okay.
Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.
I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
Look who���s back.
Captain Crunch.
Hey.
Every time there's a silence, your brain's like 'Heh-heh-huh-huh' [imitating crying].
Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1:15.
Okay.
Wait, I'm serious. It's happening.
Which means absolutely nothing.
Ready?
Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.
Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
The torches are lit.
Oh, [points to Cindy] she's asleep.
Hmm, what?
Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.
All right.
Toby works here again.
Absolutely.
Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?
Right.
All right.
What was that?
[seeing Cece gone from the couch he left her] Uh, MeeMaw, where's Cece?
Here we go...
I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.
Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?
So, you used to share that cubicle with Kelly, right?
Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about? [Michael leaves]
[On business call] Yeah.
Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.
To one without a cubicle.
Michael's birthday. It's pretty fun to watch, actually. He gets very excited, and then he eats a lot of cake. And then he runs around the office. Then he has a sugar crash in the afternoon. And then he falls asleep. And that's when we get our work done.
[to Cathy] Sorry about that.
Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.
No, thanks. You having fun?
[sighs] Hey David, how would you like a guy who���s not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?
No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, 'world's longest engagement', um, we're all expecting it, you know?
No.
Dwight, Dwight.
I gotta get out of this dress.
Mmm...
I did not do this.
[after a pause] That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.
Let's go driver! [clapping] Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...
Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.
[raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?
What do we got here?
[over the phone] How old's Kelly?
I'm sorry, did we or did we not pay for a show?
Mm!
Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.
Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
[collects Dwight's weapons from around the office; holds up a hand scythe]
Oh.
Doesn���t seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now.
Okay. Phyllis.
Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.
Yes.
No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this!
Wow, that's not such a bad idea.
[Whispers] Please stop that!
The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don't. Riveting.
[entering office] Hey. So, we saw a new billboard.
What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
He's good at his job.  And I like working for him.
Oh. You don't have to tell me this.
Sure!
All right.
No, we're good. Thank you, though.
Stanley?
Who, Stacy?
What?
Of course I read it.
What?
Closing ceremonies.
She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.
Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing.
Such a dork.
Someone's in a bad mood.
Yeah, uh, well.
How is it my fault?
If this job is in a well, I don't want it.
Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?
All right.
That's it.
You ready?
Oh, ok, cool.
No, just kidding.  Seriously though, that's enough.
Great!
No, I hear what you���re saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?
Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -
Okay, this was pretty simple-
Cranford?  No.  We will never watch that.
I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates...
Thanks Michael.
[he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!
Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- [texting on his phone]
[Jim Face]
No politics?
Pam? No!
Hello.
Love it. Keep it goin.
Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...
Your ex-wife?
Yup.  Really great.  When's she available?
Oh.
That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?
Oh, I don't smoke. Sorry.
Is that your office?
And to drink?
Yeah.
Well, turns out he actually made it up there.
Ah, gotcha.  Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.
[on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.
Dwight-
Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.
Ah, they moved the shower.
Bye.
[looks in  the refrigerator] Hey Dwight, my tuna sandwich isn't in the refrigerator. You wouldn't know anything about that would you?
How many L to a K?
I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
Come on Dwight. [sprays Dwight]
It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.
Hey.
Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.
Pam.
And what's it's name?
But you just met her.
You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good.
I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.
No...
What did I write?
Alright.
Copy that.
I'm irate right now.
No, can't.
Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
[picks a card] It's the four of hearts.
How much time do you have left on your break?
Yes. It is.
Ok.
You know what? That's private.
Nope.
At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.
Absolutely, I will do that right now.
Andy, we're gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.
Oooh! You can't handle the truth! [laughs]
[pulls Dwight's arm down] Okay. That's vivid.
[softly] Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.
I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?
This is great.
Who doesn't?
You know what? Maybe we should talk.
[crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
Wait, slow down.
Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
What?
Do I?
All right. You know what? ��Maybe we���ll just... We���ll go slow.
Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage...
I don���t know. I���ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
My charity is the Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's Department, because Dwight's a Volunteer Sheriff. So I thought this was a perfect opportunity to support/mock him.
Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
What happened?
No, not at all.
Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?
I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.
Yes, they do.
Do you?
[demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.
I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.
Okay.
I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks?
Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.
Yes! Phyllis! [claps] Phyllis, just put your foot right through here [lifts strap on box of paper]. Right through the flonk.
That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
You can't even do that.
So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight
Perfect!
I'll take it.
Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.
Hey man, good to see you.
What are you doing?
Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?
And I won't.
Hey.
Hey, Ryan?
Mm-hmm.
Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.
Hmm? No.
Yeah, I���m here. Are we all on?
No, uh-
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.
Is that it?
You come so prepared. Aspirin.
And we don't know how.
She was always engaged.
In this car?
Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
Yeah. [Doug walks away]
I don���t even know where the stairs are!
Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...
Wait, that's pretty weird.
Mmhmm, yeah.
That's what I'm saying.
Michael, that is hilarious.
Chapter 9 ��� The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.
Thank you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this.
[laughs] Told you.
Now how do you know how it works?
I got it.
Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies [holds up index cards] - that's just unfair.
Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.
You know what? I could use a little help.
Yup.
Ah.
That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.
You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?
Hey!
...which I guess I'll be taking.
Kev, c'mon.
You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
What?
Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?
Ok.
Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.
Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.'
Dwight.
Wow! There it is.
Hey, sorry everybody.
I really felt like I almost lost her, and���and nothing is worth that.
Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned.
It's 'cause I'm more of a player.
I'm sorry, wait, so is the question 'How'd I get to be so awesome?' [laughs] Because, I don't have an answer for you. [laughs]
Okay.
You know what?  Maybe it's in the ceiling.
Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we���re scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix ��� me asking the boss of the company I���m abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash.  So��� problem solved. Thanks, guys.
Dwight, come o-
Okay.
So, it's not the dumbest idea.
Four months.
I don't know.
Do we have a conversation scheduled?
Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly.
That was like, ten years ago.
Thank you.
What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.
Oh, come on!
Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten.  Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing.
Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?
The mob, maybe NASA.
No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?
No. What party?
[ahem] You can... [slightly effeminate] You can do it Ryan.
[singing the intro to The Lion King's 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight'] A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.
Mmm-hmmm.
Andy ��� this whole idea of our situation being just like war?  It���s just not true.  We just work at a paper company.  And you���re our regional manager.  And guess what man?  You don���t have to prove anything.  We like you as regional manager.  Andy if you don���t believe me take a look at what���s on my head.  I���m wearing a very pink hat.  I���ve been getting weird looks all day because I���m pretty sure ���DM does GB��� means something kinda sexual.  But guess who���s wearing them?  All of us.  Just for you man.  That���s huge.
Okay.
If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --
Thank you, delegate from Iceland.
Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.
Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.
So then, why didn't you do it?
Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?
An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?
Well... yes, that's probably what it is.  So what do I do?
Stop.  That's disgusting.
[whispering] Thank you.
Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something.
[getting up quickly to silence Michael] No, no. Nope.
Are you serious?  Pam.
He's fine. He's indestructible.
I have no idea.  We went right for the copier.
[Jan enters the office, pushing a stroller] Jan.
OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.
-I just don't know if I can do it.
Hmmm, I don't think so. Nope.
Okay.
Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?
So why did you come in here?
I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.
I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy.  But I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  [reading from various books]  Five to seven minutes.  Five to seven minutes.  Six minutes.  Different, but not really.  Five to seven minutes.
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um��� I don���t know how to tell you this, but��� we have a little bit of a problem.
Yeah, but I don't smoke.
All depends on the conference room meeting itself. [phone chimes] Uh, okay.
[under breath] Oh, no, not while I'm here.
Lousy Picture.
I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80's movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I don't do that, I think I'll be alright.
OK, I don���t have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
How do you feel?
Wow.
Yes.
Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]
Okay.
Yep, okay...
Oh, tell him I say hi.
Okay.
Who else is he mean to?
Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open.
...It's something to think about.
Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met...
Michael, you don't have to do this.
I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...
Yup.
No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
Yep.
Really? Wow... that's bad.
No. Okay. Um, I���ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
I think I got it right here.
To get married.
But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
Three months.
I think I'm ready.
Did you go to second?
No.
Well, I think you look great.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?
[Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing?
Can't do that.
Dwight, let me see your coffee cup.
Because you���re sitting?
No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
Hey.
Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?
Thanks!
Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head]
You got it.
Nobody.
Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple���s counseling.
Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
Who's they?
Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.
Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.
You're a psychopath.
You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?! [Kelly and Erin screaming as Dwight bashes their heads together, everyone attacking each other and yelling]
Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?
Hey.
Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.
Showtime!
Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.
Where do I want to go?
OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
And then you'll be saved.
[on the phone] OK.
Oh, sorry gotta go.
Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He���s putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I���ve done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight���only good surprises. ���Guten Pranken���. [chuckles]
[in the stairwell on his phone] Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!
You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I���m here.
What are you talking about?
Barely, I... I don't have all the facts.  Frank and Bean...
Oh, hi.
Yes.
Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
[tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no.
I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win.
I looked at you coming around, and I said, ���Wintergreen.���
So, you ready for the... the Dundies?
[mimicking Stanley] I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
Hey, Kelly.
That'd be great, thank you. [Erin throws package, it hits Kathy. She thinks it was Jim who threw it]
So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back.
Who, Steve?
Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.
Okay. There���s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.
Gross!
I've spent so much of my life telling myself 'Please, don't end up like Stanley,' and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes.
Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.
Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back.
Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
What's going on? Where's the belsnickel?
Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one [holds up paper]. Originally given by Benito Mussolini.
What do you know about boobs?
I think I got a pretty good sense of that one.
Nope. I'm numbering the paper.
Did you just say you remember him?
Yeah. Okay, maybe.
The last���
Check this out though, spin serve. [serves, and Dwight scores] Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...
No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--
Guys, the Afghanistananies.
An urban thing...
Toby.
Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.
I really heard him on that. This one's interesting I'm not really sure what he meant by this. Um, 'Dwight Schrute Privates.' Tough to say.
[shakes Michael's hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
[on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]
Look at that form.
Oh.
Well, that is because that is the gift that keeps on giving. Oh, my God. I left today's paper on my desk.
Nope. It's over.
Well, it could happen. Have you ever seen the movie Outbreak?
Ah, I'm sure they're all great.
Okay.
You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if he's, see if he's back.
Best prank ever.
He hit the pole!
I���ve been in here for 20 seconds.
Whoa. Who is this guy?
Now, you listen to me, sir.
[concerned look on face] You okay?
What?
I thought it'd be funny.
I win.
No, we used to. Now we're friends.
Alright Pam, alright [gives her hi-five]. Nice work!
Is there anything --
Cugino's pizza.
Bye.
Alright.
Conference room everyone.
Yes! So when do you start?
[on phone] Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a...
Andy.
Okay. I���m really sorry I told the guys I���d be there for the board meeting.
Hey.
Yikes.
Alright. Let's clear this up. [on phone] Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?
Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.
Nope. Can���t accept that job. It���s not a real job.
Dwight, come on. Don���t end on a bad note.
Okay.
Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?
You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?
I just don't know if he's presidential enough.
It is... more of a spicy brown, actually.
...and paper.
Maybe you should.
Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.
Hey!
Go get 'em.
Yeah.
But it���s Dwight who���s bring in all the weirdos.
I have nothing in common with Plop.
Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight.
That'd be great.
Space dust.
I don���t know how else to tell you.
Tuna?
Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while.
Oh-ho, I am in.
Pam! You can't be serious.
Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret.
No she doesn't wa- She's not here.
And you are not going to, either.
Wow, that sounds pretty cool.
That's cool.
No.
Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.
Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?
Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close?
I'm gonna write you up for not working.
Yeah, yeah. Exactly.
I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.
OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.
I just wanted to say hi.
Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago.
Mmm-hmm.
No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.
What are you guys doing?
No. I just missed my wife.[Gives Pam a hug and a kiss]
Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear.
He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.
Hey.
Yeah.
Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.
Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.
It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.
See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.  It's-
How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
I ain���t fraid of no ghost. [Pam holds up drawing of a hand with the middle finger raised] Whoa!
I missed you. [they embrace and kiss as Andy watches on sadly]
Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that���s only gonna make things worse.
I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.
No, no, no.
Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or...
Ryan Howard. Ryan! [claps] Gold medal.
It's still happening right now actually, so uh...
I bit my lip at lunch today.
Okay. See you guys.
Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?
She knew it.
Dwight says 'Hi.'
Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?
The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn?
I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That���s it. You look really, really good.
What?
You don't know.
Yes.
That's amazing.
You ok?
We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.
Oh! Goal!
Oh, okay. Oh, do... that's what the tape is for. I didn't know.
Thanks.
An Earl Grey tea for the lady.
Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
[swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine?
Hey uh, Michael.  Don't jump on the bouncy castle.  You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured.
Gimme a break.
Done.
[attempts to shake Dwight's hand] Goodbye, Dwight.
15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
Uh hmm, definitely.
Great. [to a group of guests]  Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
Oh boy.
Oh, it's like naughty or nice.
Ok.
Thank you.
I outran it.
Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on. [to everyone] Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. [to Katy] Desert Island. Five movies. Go.
But you���re saying there���s a chance.
Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.
I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.
Fair enough.
Hey! There she is. [Pam laughs] How you doin?
We do.
You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.
But what are you gonna do about that?
Alright, here we go. [taps page] Michael...
Right in the sweet spot. I think you���re gonna be really happy.
Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.
We know that.
So...ah, who's gonna take the dog?
Not bad.
Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. [Michael and Dwight enter] Guys?
[while Dwight and Kelly are arguing] Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-
I closed it!
Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.
Post-it Notes. Wow, that purse holds a lot.
Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?
My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this.
Yes. All right. Great. [leaves]
Yeah, we all really...
Andy, where are you?
Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try.
We're back in! Right?
Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.
Gotcha.
Ah, good. Good luck. Doing good. [goes to the index cards and writes another race down]
Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna���
Ok. Bye.
Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?
You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?
I'm really too tired to do this.
Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.
Ok.
I think you're right.
Classic.
If everyone would like to see proof.
No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.
It���s Okay.
Not bad right. [swinging golf club]
Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
You're right, we didn't dance.  It was more like, swaying.  But still romantic.
Oh yeah? What's the first best?
[whispers] That's a good point.
Please?
At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision.
Um... 'Cause your condo's in America.
Thanks, yeah.
That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot.
This is my desk.
The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational. I mean, he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year. Which is probably why this branch will be downsized.
Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
Don't..
Sounds great.
Okay.
Mmm-hmm.
So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?
Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually.
Ok.
What the heck? Is that, uh... [bends down, cuts phone cords with scissors]
I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.
Hmm, sounds risky.
Gravel company?
Well I think Meredith was just --
Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people.
Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything.
Mmhmm.
I'll call you when I get in.
Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.
Yeah.  [Jim leans in for a kiss but Pam turns away]  She's fine.
Nah, I think it's mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.
I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope]
Oh. Three nines.
Yes! [as other costumed actors come in and join Andy in song]
Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim. [shakes head] I got nothin'.
All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.
Dwight come on, come-
Hey it���s Jim Halpert.  I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight.  Because I���ve read a lot about this really great documentary.
[In Kitchen] We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.
Urkel Grue.
Oh, good.
[Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.
Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down.
Cheer up. We made a sale.
What?!
Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.
Wow. Alright. Can���t wait to meet her.
Alright.
[Gets up and looks out Nellie���s office window] He���s running!
Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.
Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents...
Good advice Beesley.  Thanks.  See you out there.
Sorry, man, I can���t focus on zingers. There���s too many potential clients.
That's nice.
Probably.
The minister just told me that it���s tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
I'm sorry what are you whispering about?
Sounds good.
Actually if I had fewer outside classes, I probably wouldn't be stuck here at a paper company.
[interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?
Oh.
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it.
Good. Good.
[reads] 'Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie.'
You set the bar so high.
Who here heard it from Ryan?
You feel good?
You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.
Okay, you could just show up late though.
No, I'm serious. There's always something better.
Was that not the--
Mmhmm.
He's a volunteer.
I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah.
Nice!
Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head:  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.
Yeah, I didn't think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.
Uh-huh.
Uh, no. Nope. Not really.
I've had a Foreman grill for about six years, I've done about 85% of my cooking on it, but I've never burnt myself, probably because I don't use it as a pillow.
[exhales sharply]
Yep.
Nope, that's okay.
Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.
Yes, let's have a word.
Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who���s gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.
Well, Pam I'm not gonna lie to you, he's chances are none. Um, he's 41 years old, he is losing his hair and his cell phone ring is 'Mambo #5.' So...
New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?
No, I'm not gonna call you that.
You know what? Maybe they just ate.
That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.
OK.
Too, too loud. Too Loud.
Really?
Fraud.
No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone.
Ahhh.
Mmm-hmm.
I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow���s his wedding day. You can���t be anything but happy on your wedding day.
Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out.
No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or...
He envies you.
There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for.
Does that include 'That's What She Said'?
Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
Listen, this isn't a favor, all right?  This is a good idea. We all win.
When did you go there?
Man.
Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
[Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.
No.
Just [drops] and then you'll be saved.
Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier.
Talla-nasty', very clever.
Yeah. I like talking to her too.
Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
[ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what?
Yeah.
Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.
What was that?
I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.
Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, let's go to the hospital.  Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.
We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.
Lets just go.
Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.
And you'll be saved.
[a text tone goes off] Is that my phone?
Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don't worry about it.
Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?
There.  Now we're even.  [Pam laughs and mimes taking a picture, they kiss]
Hey, how are you?
Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be
About you two hitting it off.
I think you did.
Can't wait.
Great, thanks.
Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton.
You did not force me to do this.
He plays guitar, he likes naval history. He's a bowler.
All right.
Not your birthday.
Good.
Wow. [cup tinkles]
Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything.  And mastered the violin.  Oop, and sold more paper.
Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.
Okay, you could just say you don't know what's going on.
So I guess I can't get up.
Yeah, woah. [deeper voice] Yep, absolutely, go ahead.
No.
Ok.
A7557962.' Totally nonsense numbers, but you do what you have to do.
Robert?
Hey... [Roy lunges towards Jim]
How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
I think we'll be okay.
I just���really wish there was something I could do. [looks off]
Right!
I'll make it worth your while, I promise.
Woo, alright.  Well, I definitely feel better.
Oh my God.
OK.
It's my own fault-
[Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
I'm not-
It wasn't me.
Allergy to... the desk?
I don't know because I everything I own is there.
Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn���t going to show up?
[Dwight and Andy stacking boxes rapidly] Nice.
See ya. Nice girl.
Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly?
Mmm.
Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.
That's awesome.
Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, 'For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?' and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
Oh, my God
Anything else?
Oh, she's good actually.
Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.
You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.
Oh, okay. Hello. Hey, David. Sure.
So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-
[goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait.
I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise. [taps Bluetooth earpiece] Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.
Don't.
I promise you, we don���t need a warning-
Okay. Michael. Could you beat up Michael?
Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen.
Not now, Toby, my God!
Not really a question. [starts to laugh] Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk.
Wish you were home.  Uh, anyway...
Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.
Michael.
So, you just couldn't take it anymore, huh?
Alright! Nice job, Oscar!
Yes, you should.
Sounds like every other party.
Son, you have to talk louder.
Are we even sure that's my file?
Yes, I... Do you want to...
Hi.
And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
Hello? Hello?
Pam.
You mean your thoughts and feelings?
Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?
He's a jerk.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Did my scores drop a little?
Chicken, hot dog, burger.
No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.
I just thought you should---
Let's go to the conference room.
If you want to come back then, that'll be fine.
Got it.
OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.
OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.
How old are you?
Well, he'll be here really soon, Kev.
Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.
Uh--
Hey, you got a second?
Darn it!
Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --
Okay, today. 5 o'clock. Closing Ceremonies.
Yeah.
Well, you're pushing the milk out, right?
But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.
Oh no. I was just -
All right.
[holds up the retrieved lead] It involves you too.
Oh yeah?
Oh, wow. But, um���Oh, I get that.
Lord, beer me strength.
Then take a different way home, man!
Okay.  That is me, but I didn't order the cake.
OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.
That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?
OK. All right.
Oh by the way how's your side project going?
Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.
[Michael is wearing a wig that is very close to Jim's actual hair, and he is wearing fake earrings, and speaking in a punk-ish deep voice] I totally don't know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?
That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.
No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap.
Yeah, you don't?
I think today was a good day to have two managers.  'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing.  But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy.  It's because they're doing it for the kids.  And I get that now.
Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk.
So instead of working, you want...
Okay, I will. [idiot voice]
Oh!
I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- [hears door, hides]
Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.
Oh, crap. Were those yours?
Wow. Psychopath.  [Karen grins widely at Jim]
You could just be saying it to get the job.
Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
I was... mocking.
I like the wild card.  I'm already liking the wild card.
Courtside seats. Sixers.
Dwight!
Punishment fits the crime.
Oh man, it was great. They were great.
[notices cleaning crew coming up to the gate] Cleaning people. Oscar. [everyone starts to walk outside] OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us.
What?
Bye. ��[pause] Yep. See, you���ve still got to press ���End,��� Pam.
Hey, you have a second?
Hey.  What's up?
Will do. [hangs up] I'll stop calling.
Stop.
All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.
And that's noon. Exactly. [others groan]
Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...
[gets up to leave room, Michael gestures for him to stay]
Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--
But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
What'd you do, Prison Mike?
Hey, whoa, Michael...
Cool.
Mmmkay...
Also good.
Right.
What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place.
Well it's just that you had no hair on Friday.
Did you murder someone?
Andy--- Ohh...
No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done.
Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?
Yeah, she's doing really well.
You want to talk about it?
Michael, no...
Yeah, that's pretty good.
You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
Exactly. Here we go. Let's do it.
It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven.
Pam, I'm scared.  I'm real scared.
Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?
Yeah.
No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.
Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker.
I don't know what else we can do here.
[turns radio down] What are you thinking?
I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.
Alright.
[watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They've been in there for 45 minutes.
Mind if I join?
Trust me.
Obviously.
Exactly. It happened in Big.
Thank you.
Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him.  And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.
No.
Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.
[on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.
But I know how to spell it.
How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.
Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
No, no, no, no...
This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
[whispering, going into the bathroom with Cece] Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!
Night-night.
Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires.
What is that?
I think you mean a girl's
Topical.
Michael, you shouldn't have done that.
Now you're just being hurtful.
Okay.
Have I not proposed to you, yet?
So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone]
Okay, you know what?  I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  He'd probably know...
Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman.
Call me when you get in. [kisses Pam]
Oh, Somebody went in. That was a team effort, Pam.
But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.
OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.
I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.
Oh, don���t look at me cause I think you���re making a terrible choice.
What are you doing?
Alright, let's get this started.  I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.
OK, great.
It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.
It was --
No, you're making this up!
Why, what happened?
Jackpot.
Stop what?
Tonight, hopefully.
Really?
He did pick a good one.
Hey, how's things?
Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we? [Dwight's phone rings. He crawls into nook under Jim's Quad-Desk]
Ow!
Yeah, I know.
Go crazy.
And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.
Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.
And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. [looks at camera] You know what, just come here.
About Julie?
Me, too.
Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?
All right.
Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.
Oh my God!  Wait, this goes back two years.
Hey, come on.
You embarrassed me.
Well, maybe you should get back to work.
Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know.
Yes.
Where did you take that?
I have nothing to do.
It's Mose. Who do you think it is?
No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this.
You all right?
All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.
I know. That's awesome, man. That's great.
Uh--
Hold on one second.
I'm a drunk driver.
Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.
Oh yeah, did he text us?
Tour, let's do the tour first.
Well, you're driving, right?
Who goes to business school?
Wow That's terrible, I really liked him.
I miss you.
I don't know.  Feel like... Friday night crowds...
What are you reading?
Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.]
It's fascinating.
What about Oscar? Could you beat Oscar?
Nice job.
Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right.
Good.
What is that, like... five pounds?
Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen...[Jim bites his lip again] You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!
Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?
Keys, keys...
Cause there was dinner, by candlelight.
Oh��� okay. Where would we go?
You really wanna bet?
Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.
Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right.
Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  [cell phone rings; Dwight's voice saying 'Idiot, Idiot, Idiot'] Oh, that's my new 'Dwight' ring.
Mm, can't do that.
Ah, coupon for a free sandwich.
Yes?
Yes, okay. Bye.
What?
No.
But you're leaving...
Ok.
Crying?
Right?
Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
[reads demerit] 'Jim Halpert, tardiness.' Ugh. I love it already.
Mm-hmm.
And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
[In staff meeting] See these forms...
Well, I mean, I don���t even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so��� These things go down all the time.
I'm really sorry. I can't do it.
We don���t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
Wow. [applause]
Beardy?
Uh-huh.
No, sometimes its right.
What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!
[Christian Slater impression] So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, 'What's going on?' Well, you're not alone.
Umm, hmm.
So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one.
I can't believe how bad this looks.
No, they don't.
[takes her hand] Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, you're so pretty.
That doesn't make sense, couldn't be.
Howard Cline?
Then why the question?
[to babysitter] So... how do you guys know each other?
She's amazing. This is very exciting.
[Jim and Dwight sitting next to each other in talking head interview] Go ahead.
Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just...
Umm���.
I really don't know how it happened, David.
Split the difference?
[approaching Michael] You have to stop this.
When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?
Wow.
Peepa.
Stop. Dwight, stop.
Who is this?
Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here.
Sure.
Scones.
Kelly, you know what...
I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.
Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don���t want to meet that person.
Oh
You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.
What?
I'm trying everything.
I'm not talking to you.
Uh, what does -- what does that mean?
Wow.
How would that work in well?  I just want to know.
I know!
Oh, I like you.
It's fire.
Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you...
Are we in danger?
Come on.
No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or...
So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
Michael.
Ow.
Right? I was just thinking...
I just need some time.
I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.
[louder] ���Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!���
OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me.
No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'.
Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.
Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he���ll be calling in any second.
[to Pam on floor] Nice effort.
Oh, would you look at that.
You know that���s���
Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?
Oh boy.
Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel?
Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?
You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine.
Can I change rooms?
No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.
What?
To madness.
[Opens folder and reads from Dwight's file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
Bye, Angela. All right, Kev.
OK, I think I can help here.
Really?
Come on. He'll listen to you.
No you don't.
Sure.
Well, yeah I don't want to see her get physically harmed, that's for sure.
I don't know about, love...
Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.
Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that it's Friday.  And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.
Great.
For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.
Fine.
Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?
And a shower.
[not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [sic] energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  [David laughs] So that's a... bonus.
Really?
I... just... if they speak Spanish.
[looks astonished] Ohhhh!
Really did [Text bleep] He responded L-O-L.
Hmm.
There���s actually not a rule that says that.
Hey.
Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?
For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin���
I have new baby pictures.
And a dart board.
What?
Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah.
My friend's basement. All right, ready to start?
Okay.
The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over.
And what happens here is-
Did you just change it to Gollum?
I don't!
I didn't... no.
Did you ever see that movie?
Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
Yup.
The next year he really stepped things up.
Time. Space. Gender. [Dwight mouthing words] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] No, that���s --
Look, you have a lot of strengths.
Okay. I���ll talk to you tomorrow.
[Dwight hands Jim a piece of paper] Oh, what's this?
I���ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I���d be proud to take.
Hey.
How are you?
[on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.
Seriously?
Damn.
He never called a meeting.
Oh, burn.  Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too. [they laugh]
Welcome back.
What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.
Duh.
Jerry.
[smelling the stink] Oh.  Wow.
Pretty sure everyone heard that.
If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
You want to just make a run for it?
Oh, the best.
Everything is going to be ok.
Well done.
Oh, loves it.
Right... That's good.
No one.
Oh, yeah?
You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
Right?
Oh, sure.
Oh hey, Dwight.
No-no-no-no-no.
Why is that, why is that weird?
Dave.
Uh huh.
So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
Hey.
Mmm-hmm.
Sure, what's up?
I'm excited, I've actually never been to Gettysburg. Uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so I freaked out and we turned the car around. But I'm older now, I can outrun a zombie.
Yup...
Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.
Is it?
Good one.
Which one was it?
Alright.
Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.
Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
Mmm, that's where you're wrong.  I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require.  So, I think we should go get some.  Now, please.
So, I guess I'll see you in [looks at watch] ten hours.
Exactly.
Hey!
Those are the doves.
It is right. I mean, it's impossible.
Oh yeah, how long's this meeting going to last?  [Stanley mumbles, looking at his watch]
Ok, you're on.
Wow. Thanks.
[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm excited.  Oh, definitely.
Oh.
I will do some research.
Hey, man. It���s halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don���t. I���m in. Yeah, yep, I���m all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. [hangs up] Yeah!
I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one.
And you didn't fail those things either.
You know, that's probably not gonna last too long, you should go to a hospital and get a real cast.
Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  I'll talk to them.
What about cars?
Dragging.
How do you know it was me?
That would be fun.
Hey, how are you and Darryl?
Hey, Amy.  How ya doing?
I was very drunk.
All right-
Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
You were right.
Nice.
[in the conference room] Hey Pam, can I see you for a second?  So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day.  So he generously offered to wash our car.
Another worm? Like, are they friends?
Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this: umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. [reveals Dwight's purple belt]
Oh, Holy Mother of God.
Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try.
Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?
Pop-up?
Alright.
Wait.
OK, I'm gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael's office] to do some work. So I will be in here.
That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?
Right there! [points to Cathy]
You did not have sex with Pam's mom.
I am.
What a great year for the Dundies.
All right. Now I think it's time for you to go.
Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer]
I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day.  So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna.  ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name.
[walks up to reception] Margaret?
Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.
No.
Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.
I would prefer not to.
Nope.
Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.
Yeah!
You're not, nope.  Nope.
Yeah, I want to go home.
There it is.
What's gay-dar?
By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?
Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you���re not the best with the phone.
That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?
Let's do it.
The office.
Probably is.
I got it.  Alright.
What!?
Nothin' much what's up with you?
Hey, grandma's back.
I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
That's not true.
No. Was that the hard way?
And the final clue...
Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things.
[reluctantly] Spinning would be more fun.
And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
Hey.
You are not my superior.
Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]
Gosh.
Oh, I stand corrected.
Sure you don't want the teapot?
You���re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
Wait, when was this?
I didn't sign anything.
Absolutely, I do.
[Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
You have no idea.
Absolutely.
Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food.  In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food.
Right here.
Ah, show me how this works.
Yeah. Bye Pam.
[growling] Nice.
No, you're not.
And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat]
No, Dwight. You���ll be doing the whacking.
Ah, let's do it. [laughs] Oh, that's healthy.
Thanks.
The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California��� for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.�� He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don���t really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.���� And he chose���
that's great.
We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
Really? 'cause... seems pretty narrow... and short.
No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.
[As he's walking out] That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!
Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.
Oh, come on, that sounds awesome.
[Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.
Yeah.  Sure.
We're going to Utica?
Wow.
No, that's your conscience. Listen to it.
One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
What? No.
I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me.
Oh, and I get to carry it.
That might be a little difficult with the one computer.
Did I? I don't...
I'm sure it's fine.
We were... I think she was just trying to-
Alright. So, tell me all about it.
And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]
For what?
Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?
I don���t know how else to tell you, okay? I���m doing everything I can every week to bring home something...
No thanks.
Yeah that's great. Great.
No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.
So happy right now.
That makes sense.
Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!
What is going on?
[puts his phone in his coffee mug and calls Gabe]
And stuff... yeah.
Oscar?
And of course, classy.
Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.
You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?
[silently counting] Three, two, one... [Erin turns on the office lights, all laugh loudly]
Yeah, right.
Oh. Oh!
[stammers] I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.
Good one.
Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.
[expletive]
[Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing, Jim imitates her] Can I do something for ya?
Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?
Sounds good.
Psst. You think this thing's gonna go much longer?
Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write?
You know what?  Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition?  I'd love to see that dunk of yours.
I don't know how we'd go about doing that.
Yeah.
There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
No way. I think she likes this stuff.
Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.
She dies.
OK, thank you for ... this.
Customers have to use the coupon code from the website.  And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.
Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we don't need a new system though.  Happy with ours.
How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.
Ok.
You wanna pull a prank on Andy?
What does that mean?
Actually here for something else.
What answers?
Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.
Hey Karen.
Unless you think he can���t handle it.
Which ideally would be me....
Yeah.
Yeah?
Oh wow, thank you.
Everything's fine.
There���s a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.
So what are you going to do?
Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.
I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.
Maybe. Thanks.
[taps car] Lincoln.
Yeah. [chuckles]
There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.
KGB.
Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play?
Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-... [Jim bites his lip]
No. Michael. Michael.
That sounds awesome.
...and finds the... fake grail? No grail?
All right!
Seriously?
Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-
I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.
Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?
Yep.
Okay.
OK, what are you --
Well it���s sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
Austin Powers.
That's a lot of reasons! [suspicious]
Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go. [hands her an envelope with money in it]
Notify the athletes.
How was your meeting with Michael?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
[holds up an ASCII image of Dwight]
Strongly-painted picture.
Right.
You don't know what it is.
Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input���
[entire office is chatting] I'm saying, all I'm saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying.
No, you're definitely the problem.
Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.
No, Pam.
Yeah, that was nuts.
[on the phone] Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great. [goes into a private room where Pam and the doctor are, the voices are inaudible, but the camera can see through a window, Pam and Jim look in shock, they hug and Jim goes back out into the hall to call Dwight back, trembling] Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs! [laughs] Ohh! [goes back into the room to hug Pam]
Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.
Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
Uh, you know, we'll see, we'll see.
We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.
What was that?
I was just... I'm in love with you.
Yeah, I did. [they kiss]
These are actually forks and knives from the break room.
Hey.
Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.
But you know I wouldn���t hire any of these all-stars.
Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
���Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA��� Dash JH.
[on phone] Andy?
Thanks Janet.
If your client likes Italian food, you bring him to Cugino's.  And if your client likes a little action, you bring him a gambler.  And if your client hates Cornell, you bring him Andy.
Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.
All right? I���m gonna wait.
A little bit. ... Worth it.
Oh I'm sorry.  What?
The new guys called one.
No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar?
Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can...
You got it.
He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
We should probably get back.
When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.
Easy.
That's-
And that's not the same.
Is that him?
Goodnight, Michael.
Mm-hmm.
No, we've been dating for six months.
1870's...
Yes, you do.
Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.
All right [high fives Kevin]
[Windows reboot sound] Dwight, want an Altoid?
I promise you, you don���t have to do this for me.
Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
Yeah, definitely didn't need help with that, but, yeah.
Can I get a drink?
He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?
Hey, Kev. How you doing?
You���re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh���
[everyone shouting at once] Michael! Michael!
Yeah?
[Jim moves his head closer and Pam taps him gently in the face] Oh, ok.
No.
Hey, Dwight. It's Jim.
[hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down]
Well you gotta figure this out.
Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just...
So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.
Nope, he means tuna dog.
Ok, Roy?
Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away]
[leaning against Creed's desk] So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party.
So, how was the resort?  Did you ski a lot?
Sure.
Huh. Well, you know, you can���t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what���s most important. That���s my new thing.
[sighs and knocks on Michaels door]
Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?
You know, at the end of the day, it���s really only two days. I mean, I���ll be back in the office. ��If you need me for an emergency, call me. ��I���ll be there...
Oh. Um. I think we're good.
[On phone in hallway] No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.
Good to see you, too.
Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company.
Good. Please hurry.
And then compare.
What about a gift basket full of cash?
Do you even know what that means?
Absolutely not.
Did you break the shredder Kevin?
Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep.
Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings.  Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.
Nothing.
Well, by worst, you mean the best.
What are the two levels?
Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now.  Totally.
Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.
Oh!
Actually not.  It was really so-so.
Yeah. [chanting] Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!
Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?
I'm not talking to you.
Well, I'm evolving, Pam.
No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.
Do you want to play-
Ok.
Guys, this isn't some elaborate scam, okay?
Hey man, how you doin'? Jim Halpert.
[sighs] Gross.
All right.
Did you just come up with that?
Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!
Nice. [fist bumps Kevin]
I wasn't. But thank you. [to Pam] Do you know anything about this party?
Can I get a drink?
That's him.
[walks into his office and sees the mallard back on his desk] Dwight, you brought the mallard back.
Whoo.
Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.
I'm gonna introduce myself.
Oh my God! You are so drunk!
Nothing yet.
Thank you, sir. [Tips his glass to Daryl]
I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
See, that's weird.
What?
All right.
Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. [Everyone talking Phyllis pours Jim some eggnog, as Daryl walks in] Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?
Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more.
Well, I work here now.
Love you too. Bye.
Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.
Ok, sure. Will do.
I���m doing this just for me? Is that what I���m doing? I���m doing it just for me. If that���s what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?
Right.
Yeah, I guess.
Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!
Yup.
Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing.
[as Pam has another contraction]  Oh!  Oh, alright.  That's a good one.
For the North.
And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.
Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
Alright. [Kelly squeals]
[raises hand] Are you stoned?
Ok.
No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?
I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.
Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. [Reveal Jim behind Quad-Desk] Thank you.
How are we doing on contractions?
Michael, can I talk to you in your office?
It's still on a bike path though right?
We'll look into it.
I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?
What's that?
Yeah.
[phone] Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.
Chapter seven: The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.
Come on.
What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.
Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.
Three times.
You do?
Andy revealed himself to be a double agent.  At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent.  And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent.  Oh, and it is 6:00.
Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.
Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away.
Are you serious? [starts typing on the computer and Andy begins to lean in toward the computer]
Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way?
Nice.
This, man. I can���t do this to Pam.
Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves]
Thanks Meredith.
Oh, no no.
Is this allowed?
I'll do it.
Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.
Wrong, for so many reasons.
I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]
No, it's bad. Darryl canceled go-karting....
Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God.
[on phone, leaving a message] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. [hangs up and exhales sharply]
Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.
Yup. That's exactly what we did.
Kevin, do it.
I'll just go later.
Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.
Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
I will.
Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain.
I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening.
Of course.  What is like a hostage?
Well, at least I don't have cavities.
Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?
So what's your strategy for this race?
Shh!
Yeah.
Mmum, still wrong.
Yeah.
Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.
Yeah. That does not feel good.
A place?
OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use [finds a mug] uh, oh -- Snoopy.
Yeah. Right?
Are you really gonna marry him?  [Pam nods] ...Ok.
What are you talking about?
Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.
Beesly! Oh, my god.
Right now?
That's pretty cool.
[yawning] What about an energy drink or something?
Brace yourself. 3��� 2���
You wanna do this?
Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'.
Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs.
Oh.
Get up.
Oh, my God! Wow.
Too late, Kev.
Mm-Kay, Well, it can't be zero, Kev.
Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.
All right, I'm taking off.
Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?
Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.
Oh. Right, that style.
Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?
Why won't more people do that? [laughs]
I don't know if I can.
Is your password Frodo?
You do?
Half hour.
Oh, did the press ask for a story?
Is that really how you want to get this job?
I just... couldn't wait.
For a lot of reasons.
[drawing two family trees on a whiteboard] Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through [draws a question mark] delusion.
That's an overreaction.
Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.
Really.
Your mom.
There they are.
Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?
I thought it was a fun idea.
So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
I guess. [Pam smiles and walks away, then comes back and kisses Jim on the cheek] How dare you.
I think I���m a little too busy these days to s--- [whispering] Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.
Cece���s ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I���ve been working with her on her move. It���s called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It���s kind of like this. It���s pretty cute, right?
Why don't... Let's...
I���ll call you when I get there.
Would you like to be our fourth?
What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!
We gotta get someone else in there right now.
How do you hate it? It's a cake.
You all right? [Oscar nods]
Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?
We're gonna stay.
And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back.
Alright, here we go!  You're doing great!  She'll be here soon.
Oh, just somewhere in the Poconos. I was just surfing.
Tell 'em.
[on phone] All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. [hangs up the phone and rubs his eyes] Whoo! [Erin jumps in the background]
[inspecting the hole in the wall] Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall.
Nope.
So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
[hands David his papers] There you go.
No, don't push.  Pull.  Pull.
[on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled?
Yeah, okay.
Good game Meredith.
So, really, you're just calling her?
I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.
Mmmhmm.  Why don't you start by telling me what you got.
Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. [Pam nods reluctantly]  And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date.
Hey.
They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now. [crumples up beans, stomps on them, and throws them in a box]
Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.
That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
Okay.
Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]
I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.
Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.
How are you doing this?
Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.
Oh, I don't know.
No.
Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.
Perfect.
Yes.
Alright.  Time to go.  Okay.
Free paper.'
Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here...
Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
[thinks] The friendships.
Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?
He definitely stole my iPod.
No, you're not reopening the case.  The case is closed.
Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today?
[whispering] I don't even know who you are anymore.
Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?
So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.
No, no, you won't do that. Nope.
Oh, God. [hangs up phone]
Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
I know.
Yeah.
That's it.
You're a jackass.
True love's kiss.
Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.
Oh yeah?
No... I think it's a great idea.
You want a birthday pie?
Oh yeah?
Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then... [reading text message] 'How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight.'
You all right? What���s going on?
Hi, David.
I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.
Dwight! Dwight!
Does my room have cable?
God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?
Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?
Stop, stop, stop.
Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys. [to Pam, under his breath] Can I have your sunglasses?
And I don't support her choice to hit you.
You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.
I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.
Yeah, you can.
Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
Good.
You knew it.
Yeah. ��Thank you. Thank you.
That's not it.
Co-manager, actually.
[on phone]: Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ...
And you went to New York to do this.  So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?
[as he and Pam flip their cards] John Stamos.
Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.
No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?
Okay. [IM chiming] [laughing]
[A note is on Jim's computer that says, 'It is time. Parking lot at noon.' Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]
You know, I just think you should know that-
If this doomsday device goes off...
Oh, you guys doing a little construction?
Yeah.
Hey, easy, easy...
After you sir.
Take care of my wife. I will be back.
Yeah.
Yes.
Pam. Okay, now I've tried everything.
Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?
OK. [Meredith leaves]
Hey.
Well, what if I just do this?
Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis.
Are you a cocktail waitress?
He welcomes you.
[Pam starts nodding in agreement] Why are you nodding?
That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it's a murder.
I'm... leaving on June 8th.
All right!  [sitting down behind Michael's desk] I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but...
Right.
What do we got?
Yeah.
Oh, they're my client.
Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
Oh, Dawson's Creek.
Why are you telling us this?
What?
Now, were those for the team?
Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually.  But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers.
Okay.
Great. What's new with you?
What did he say?
Is there really?
And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.
I think she will.
Gettin��� a lot of mileage out of this, aren���t ya?
Really?
Oh! There it is!
Wow, this is my lucky day.
No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
Ohhh...
Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.
Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... .
I'll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye.
No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.
Good one.
What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
Hey, man.
Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?
Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.
Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. God, it's freezing, I gotta go in. You stay though for like five minutes.
Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings]
He... It's a crime fighting beaver.
Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.
Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...
Are you alright?
Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-
I do remember, yeah.
What are you talking about?
And I was still just a paper salesman.
One Charlie's Angels. One. Let's go.
That���s pretty good. I feel safe.
We were robbed last night.
At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it.  I'm told it started as a team building exercise.  Unfortunately I really suck at it.  We didn't play many video games in Scranton.  Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor.  And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus.
OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.
New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door���
Look, Pam, I don���t know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It���s gone. That moment���s just gone. I missed it.
Yeah, was it 10? Yeah, I have it on a mix tape from junior high.
I don't want -
Michael...
Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?
He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!
That was a great idea.
Robert.
Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?
Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
It's locked.
What?
OK. careful, thanks. [takes bullhorn from Andy]
Okay, done.
Definitely can't do that.
Hey.
Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?
Okay.
Nurse!
Uh, my ex-fianc��.
Thank you for choosing me.
You knew it.
No, it- [high-pitched feedback as Jim starts to leave, feedback changes as he moves, turns over the mallard to see the listening devics, sighs, places mallard back on the desk]
Co-managing is a give and take.  You have to pick your battles.  One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them.  He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.
Thanks for the head's up, Kev.
Good.
Huh.
No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.
Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?
Could, keep that down.
Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
Toby and I used to sit together until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much.
Ooh.
Sounds tough.
I...  Pam, please.
Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday.  So, keep that goin'.
I was just trying to be unbiased.
Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.
Michael, you didn't even know her.
Spot on.
Thanks.
That is not the expression.
Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
Oh.  Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.
Yeah, right. I mean, unless they���re willing to pass some tests.
Now, this is the projection over three months?
Yes!  I think we should look into that.  If you could just speak up louder...
Just tell her the real reason.
Good night, Dwight. [Jim leaves, Dwight continues crying]
You really wanna fight on Valentine's Day?
Wow.
[ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.
Oh boy...
A futon?
But I think it���s big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea���.which, by the way, I can���t wait for.
I remember that.
How you doing?
Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs]
Dwight! Are your legs broken?
Hey!  Welcome back!
[impersonating Fonzie]  Ayyyy!
Um, thank you, Ryan, uh, I don't know, I think I made the mistake one day of telling someone that I like penguins, and here we are.
Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.
I just want it to stop.
Or zipadeedoodaah.
Whoa.
I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.
Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.
Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?
I have noticed that we--
Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?
So, none of them?
I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.
[talking on phone] Sure, I can hold.
OK...
Pam.
So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so...
Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?
LOVE the hair. [Ryan walks up driveway with blonde dyed hair]
Ok...that's not...
[on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big.
Thank you.
Unbelievable.
OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later. [hangs up]  That was a good story.
[Sighs] I'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes.
Yep.
Okay, Michael!  Focus!
Thank you.
Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
[over phone] What?
That's true.  That's right.  Yeah.
[driving, sighs, laughs] No. you know what? No. Because... I'm not that guy. And [laughs] we are not that couple. [turns around]
All right, easy there, grandpa.
You'd slow me down.
What?
Potential future nonsense.
Hey!
You���re not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I���m in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You���ve agreed to this.
Oh no, we're just sitting here.
Oh yeah.  Why?
I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...
I didn't have anything, Jan.
[to Pam] What?
In the picture, are you high?
Yeah, me neither.
Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.
You couldn't of memorized that?
I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.
Sorry about that.
You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
Have a good night.
That I thought we were millionaires.
[in women's bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.
Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. [shows picture of Cici with devil doodles] Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?
Good. I like it. You know what. Pretend to smoke. [Dwight pretends to smoke]
Okay.
It���s, it���s nothing.
I will. I will.
[clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up]
To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?
Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
[walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] 'Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.' [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!
Hey.
She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that���s fine.
Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
Today's a big day.  Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  It's got shag carpets.  I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting]  She's gonna love it.  Right?
Nope. No dog video.
Nope.
[in Darryl and Jim's Philly apartment] Hey.
Oh, I can't beat Darryl.
Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again. [Pam rolls her eyes and walks away]
Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.
[interrupting] That Pam's pregnant.
Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
In the bed.
No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.
Hey.
Ummm... no idea.
[approaches Roy back at the wedding] There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?
No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]
Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--
Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?
Eight months?
Yeah I couldn't cut it down.
Okay.
Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
Right.
Only two hundred dollars?
Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I���m waiting.
That���s funny.  Ok.
I'll use that.
Right. It's city and country combined.
Right.
Uh hmm.
I can't believe it was me.
Oh, I didn���t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.
Well I do.
No. D-
What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?
Hey, Phyllis, Do you have any games that you play in the office?
Is that Michael?
It���s a little, uh, personal.
On a wing and a prayer, mostly.
I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
Well that's great.  [shakes Ryan's hand] You're talking about your court ordered community service?
[pointing to computer monitor] So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view. [picture of Dwight and Mose on a see-saw]
Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.
Touche?
Show him how to use it.
O-Kay.
You know what it���s not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped.
Hey.
Whoa.  Whoa.  Wait.
[dictating to Pam] Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.
Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.
I know. We're pretty excited, too.
Andy, it's the last day of the quarter. We've already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.
Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.
[under his breath] Didn't think you'd notice...
Me neither. Whew.
The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
Cool. Thanks. [puts his hat on Erin's head]
Dwight, you can���t just hire someone ���cause they���re your friend.
Oh, man, so many points being made.
I wasn't here that day.
[sounds of a car crash] What was that...
Mm-hm.
I disagree with.
So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?
Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable.
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.
Can I have a late checkout?
Oh, great.
It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird.
Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?
Yup. I'll trade.
Good!
Hi David.
That's a good one. [a red sports car drives up] Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?
It's really good to see you, man.
I'll take it.
You bet.
That's all right.
Hey! What the hell's goin' on?
Which is you.
Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.
Actually, you didn't.
Hey dude, you know what a 'rundown' is?
I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
Do Snowboarders hate animals?
Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.
Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager.
Wow.  Never pegged you for a quitter.
Well, you're... in... prison, but, mmhmm.
Ah, you know me too well.
Hi! [Awkward]
Nobody's for.
I think you seem distracted.
Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.
Right.
[looks around room nervously]
[touches headset] Call you right back. What were you saying?
Hello?
Your agenda-taking pleases him.
Stop.
You were right.
[makes kissing, puckering sound]
No, you chose yourself.
Hey, how is... Toby?
No.
You can't lay down.
Ferris Bueller.
I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...
It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.
Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
[Holds up Hooters t-shirt] Just you know politics, literature.
Definitely not. That's disgusting.
[starts clapping] Yeah, alright Kev.
There's the charm.
But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.
Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.
Beesley, coffee?
Look at that one though, he's smiling!
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?
Hey, can't really talk now, what's up?
Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?
Don���t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.
Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.
I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
Not a surprise.
By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.
Oh, Pam? Can I see you in here for a second? It's important, so...
These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one.  [Michael stands on podium] Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal. [everyone claps]
Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.
I don't like that.
What?
You sure?
You just had a rebound.
Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?
Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like.
So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.
That���s pretty good.  What about uh, for a thousand points?
Pam? Get us back into it.
Ah, hey.
Nope.
Yes--
Oh yeah-
...Okay.
And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]
Wow.
Yeah, gotta eat somewhere.
Right?
Scared me.  How's the party planning going?
[holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe.
[continues working]
Alright, I have my wallet.
Nope we're not brothers.
...Okay I can't... help you... with that.
It is totally insane.
Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
OK, Kenny.
Right.
Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim's desk and walks away]
Stay in bed!
Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight...
It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.'
We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.
Do you want a corn dog?
Yeah?
Wind.
Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.
Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
You heard that one.
Who's that?
Nope, I got eel.
Hey.
Oh, man. Yeah, I can���t do it.
Uh, Kitchen.
This is gonna be awful.
Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.
Pam gets a little down.  Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago.
And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says 'No, Jim, here's a way.'
Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.
Guy's going by. Shh.
Hey.
All right. [smiles]
Mm-hmm.
Improv sounds great.
I���m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You���ve got a regional manager.
I think it'll take you a little longer than that.
So, that's... It's great.
Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.
Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
Am I going down a road?
Yeah.
Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of ���Pilot���]
Perform a test.
This is hilarious, but we���re gonna stop with all--
Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.
You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.
Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.
Private Room.
Sounds good Andy.
[to Pam] Really?
No.
Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!
[chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.
That���s true, yeah.
I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
Wow, hey.
I think she'd be a really good salesperson.
Okay.
Yikes.
The mall?
Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.
Here we go.  Here we go.
Hey! Back here.
She's not really my type.
Catching butterflies.
Dwight!
I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap!
[getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks.
I bought it.  It's ours.  Let's go inside, I'll show you inside.  [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor.  Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet.  Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall]  Yeah, I am really sorry about this.  I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there.  Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.  [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so... [shuts the door]
[in the kitchen] Oh, here's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-
That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...
It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.
Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky.
Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.
Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?
...Absolutely you should.
The Beets Motel? That is, wow.
Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier.
When did you need that rundown by?
[on the phone] Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!
Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.
Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.
No.
Yeah.
I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.
Hi.
Wait, what?
So, the situation is the worst.
If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.
So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.
K, Kevin, are you saying ���See the world���? or ���Sea World?���
[whispers] Let me get that for you.
Oh, come on, Pete! God, that���s just sad. If he doesn���t watch himself, he���s gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.
Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea.  Let's go out.
Respectable?
You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
No way.
It's not hilarious, but...
Story's kinda bland.  It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
So how does it work? It���s like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or���
What���s going on?
No, I don't.
Yeah
Yes. They totally do.
Yeah, I thought you started it.
What?
I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing...
Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.
We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.
I'm sorry.  She scares me. [walks away, Pam keeps eating]
See ya.
Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.
Cool.
No.
So weird.
Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee.
Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...
Oh... oh!
We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an 'Andy for Manager?' pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.
What's up?
That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can ..
Dwight, question.
Phoenix Sun's point guard?
Smart. Good. [to Angela] Hey, Angela.
Looks like a red wire.
Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here.
Thank you.
Okay, DVDs. Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Toby, go ahead.
So this is my life.  Until I win the lottery [laughs].  Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
Seriously!
What was that?
My condolences.
Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
Oh great, I have to cover?
DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island?  Yes! Meredith?
Well, I second that emotion.
That's impossible. [Dwight climbs through ceiling hatch] Dwight!
Yep.  Yeah.  She's blind, is that a problem?
Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here.
[Jim slams lunchbag on table] I just totally blew a sales call.
You know this isn't real TV, right?
Dwight and I are both writing letters to our clients. I'm just sending a quick note to say how much I appreciate their business, and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation. It's just... different styles.
Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.
Nothing. Guys? Timer's still going? Er?
Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
Nice.
What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
Don't do it.
I'm going to take off actually.
I'm coming.
We can't figure that out.
No he doesn't.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
I have one, too. Jim. Jim, Is Jim. My name is Jim.
Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh.
You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...
Oh, also, while you���re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.
No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back.
What's that?
Really?
Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her.  It'll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy.  Uh... June.  Summer.  So, that'll be nice.  And that's that.
Sorry, Stinky, can���t do it. Too busy.
Nice. Smart.
Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question.
Interesting, what's that like?
I'll try both.
Uh, Ryan can never know.
Okay.
Oh...
That's the Christmas spirit.
I'd go with that.
Here's the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because they're set up to do that kind of thing.
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us all to believe that he was the father... by telling us he was the father.  But then we got this e-mail from Jan.  [waves paper and reads from it] 'Hi, everyone!  Jan here, writing to share some wonderful news and to quash a rumor.  First, the great news - I am expecting.  The beautiful baby inside me will be ready to meet the world this fall just a few months before the launch of the new Serenity by Jan line (shameless plug, I know, don't hate me, LOL).  Anyway, I also wanted to clarify that the father is not anyone that you or I have ever met.  Remember, no matter how excited someone is about my baby, it does not make them the father.  Best, Jan.  P.S. Hope to ship you something soon.'
Pam?
Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name.
Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman.
Screw ���em.
Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday.
What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone.
Whoa.
What's that?
Absolutely, will do.
Pam!  You don't think he'll mind if we take the shampoo, do you? [holds up large bottle]
What? [looks in box] Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?
Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...
Oh my God!
Oh wow.  So that���s two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
Are you serious?
Okay.
That's it. Or Mr. Peanut.
What?
Hey.
All right, guys. It didn���t work out for any of us, so��� we���re still on the same team. Let me get these.
Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.
Have a good game man.
Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.
Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.
um��� I mean-
Because it is Halloween. So if you���re going to sing a concert, it���s a good idea to throw that one in.
Slowly, slowly.  Let's just get to the elevator.
Wow.
Please stop.
Perfect.
That doesn't exist anymore.
No, not exactly.
What about music?  Do you have any music?
Well, then I guess you���re ready for this. [gives her the Christmas card]
[on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]
[points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean?
I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
Okay.
I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.
It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.
Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.
Okay.
Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?
Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry.
[reading text] Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.
No.
A- ah--
[changes channel during commercial, sports scores appear on screen.]
[laughing] She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.
I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.
We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man.
Mm-hmm?
Um, oh man, I don���t actually know.
I mean, do you like it? You having fun? [Andy snorts, unsure how to answer] Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun���.and you did that.
Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight.
Beesly, are you threatening me?
College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
We���ll talk about it later.
The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding.
Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
Yeah, trying to quit though.
And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.  [everyone claps and makes comments]
Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.
And I have started a business in Philadelphia. [Pam shrugs]
Really.
This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim.
I don't think you had to.
A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?
Hey man. I am so sorry about that.
What are you doing?
You define foment.
Hmmm.
[behind Dwight]: OK.
I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here: Michael handles more of the 'big-picture' stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...
Well we are here now, so let's just--
Can I address that?
You got it.
And I found out that there's a bus at 5:00 a.m.
Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?
Hey.
Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy.
Who was that?
Sales form for you to sign.
Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind.
You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.
You've been gone for a long time.
Mmm... I'd prefer to sit in back.
... Yes.
To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.
[Michael is seen debating on whether to come back in to the office] Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?
Yesss. And you're Abby, right?
We'll see.  I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.
So it's going great, sounds like.
Michael, I'm just trying to --
No. We took a walk.
Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...
Oh, I expected more from young Halpert.
[on phone] Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. [to office co-workers] Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out. [lowers voice] He said it should just be under an hour, so... [everyone groans] we did it.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone.
Okay.
No.
Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?
Perfect.
And how many would you like?
Yeah. Thank you.
[disgusted groan]
Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.
Sure. That they should do one.
Definitely we should.
No, that was his wife, so he's on his way.
Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool.
Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham! [mimes punch] Gotta go through me first.
Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal.
Okay.
Shawn Marion.
Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous.
Ten. It was the full ten.
Nevermind.
Okay, good then.
Okay.
Pam, will you marry me?
fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,
[looks bored. Taps finger on desk. Head falls to desk]
Oh...
[to Eric] You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
How's that gonna help you?
Right.
They're probably worthless.
Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses.  Uh, four dollars.  And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble.  And that's a grand total of... [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars.
I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.
Michael, come on!
Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes.
Angela, burger? Dog?  Havin' fun?
Hey, I���m in Philadelphia right now.
I'm sorry. This is for a news audition?
Ok
Are you not gonna put out the torches?
False.  Black bear.
Hey guys, what're we talking about?
And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.
So, how you holdin' up?
I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?
No, I don't think so.
I know.
Alright.
Good, right?  Hello.
Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
No, no, don't do anything to them.
All right.
Who?
Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
That's increadible.
Would...
How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?
Nope.
When?
I deserved that.
What's going on?
I think it���s definitely��� Well, okay. Either way���
[imitating Andy] 'It's not freakin' funny!'
All right, guys, stop.
Yes.
Frank and beans!
Best Christmas ever.
Wow. I think you're bluffing.
In Philadelphia.
Okay now really think hard about this one:  One year.
What are you doing?
Stanley. Stanley.
Michael stop.
Wow, what are we talking about?
Well, your office is behind you.
Why?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.
Oh, yeah.  Don't worry about it.
