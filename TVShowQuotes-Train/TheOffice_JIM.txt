[makes kissing, puckering sound]
We'll see.  I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.
You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.
You should ask him. It���s a color you would never expect. [Dwight storms off] Too easy.
I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.
Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies [holds up index cards] - that's just unfair.
Doesn���t seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.
Your mom.
Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -
Mm-hmm.
What about you?
Enjoy, enjoy.
What?
Yeah. I have a question for you.
I'm sure it's fine.
Whoa whoa whoa!
Nice job, I think you got 'em.
Hey.
So, where did you learn how to play?
[standing outside, dials Dwight's cell phone]
You are really good at modesty. She���s a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kids��� room. There���s a hippo leading a parade of 500 children���
Really?
that's great.
What happened?
That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.
Yep.  [Maguire keeps swinging]
You were right.
Angela, it���s Halloween. You have to sing ���Monster Mash���.
Yes, you should.
Unfair. When���s my birthday?
Okay, so--
Definitely.
Alright buddy.
Also good.
Not as good as you.
Ferris Bueller.
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
You haven't done any of the research.
There���s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor ���
Yeah. At least for one more dance.
[whispering] Hey.
Yeah. [Doug walks away]
Sure.  Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-
I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.
That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
[walks up to reception] Margaret?
[dictating to Pam] Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
[whispers to Pam] Shel Silverstein.
That's a good one. [a red sports car drives up] Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?
Wow, what are we talking about?
Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..
[interrupting] Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right? [tosses black licorice into trash]
Hey Dwight.
Did you go to second?
I will grant you one wish.
Don't do that.
Uh...
I'm gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids.
I think you mean smug
Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. [behind Jim, Dwight climbs telephone pole] Oh he'll be fine. I made it up there.
Where are you going?
Give the bottle to Michael!
It's true. I'm having a party.  I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up.  [sighs]  He is very real.
Yeah.
okay.
A- ah--
Yeah.
Loggins and Messina.
I just thought you should---
I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?
Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, it's totally hypothetical.
I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.
He didn't text me.  [Andy's phone chimes]
Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it.
I am not gonna do this.
Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
Yeah... maybe.
You know what's crazy?
There's the charm.
[behind Dwight]: OK.
Uh, by the way. Have you heard Dwight say the word immunity, yet? Because if I can get Dwight to say the word immunity, it might be the greatest day of my life.
OooOK.
This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?
I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!
Andy, can I talk to you for a second?
Andy, where are you?
Oh, it���s happening!  Let���s just keep it between you and me for right now.
Dwight!
Oh, you know what? I gotta go.
Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?
Hey, how's things?
[holds up card] This one's a map.
Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
[Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.
Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn���t going to show up?
Smart.
[bounces ball off wall with Toby] So that's what this sound is all day.
Can you give us a hint?
But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.
Great, yeah, good.
That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom.
You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.
Jan didn't come back for her car last night.
Yeah?
Sales.
[cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.
Where'd I put what?
My bad.
Thank you.
No.
So, next interview has to be better.
New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door���
The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was...[car alarm blaring] was in the...
Pam, I couldn���t get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.
And in this room here, if you look closely, you will find out a few clues about who lives here.  Um, he likes biking, obviously, and uh, what else?  Uh, he likes tour guides, I guess.  And if you're very perceptive, you'll notice that he didn't do a great job of cleaning his room [kicks water bottle under bed].  Ok, and uh, that's the tou-
I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why.  Interesting.
Okay.
Thanks.
Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.
When?
... MICHAEL!
We did it.
Oh. Um. I think we're good.
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
Really...
Really?
I think you're good.  Doing a good job.
You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
I'm not.
Okay, this was pretty simple-
OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter.
You���re the best.
Oh man, it was great. They were great.
So, don't tell.
No.
Yes! So when do you start?
[on cell phone] Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.
What's that?
I'm not gonna- [cuts himself off, Kevin walks in]
Who's they?
Hmmm.
What are you doing?
Yeah, he's definitely something.
You making this up as you go along, aren't you?
Tell 'em.
It's 'cause I'm more of a player.
Don't-
Really?
Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.
Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That's it.
Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.
How are you doing this?
But you didn't fail.
[as Andy and Kevin shout 'yeah!' in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.
[playing Call of Duty] Oh? Someone's left out in the open, taking a little siesta. Not smart. [shoots] Yes! Finally killed you... [Karen's desk is empty]
Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker.  And a great number two for the office.
Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.
Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.
He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?
You couldn't of memorized that?
So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
[Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.
Alright.
Michael, I told you.
It was pretty uneventful, actually.
What? Pam!
I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
Oh, Pam? Can I see you in here for a second? It's important, so...
Sure, yeah, go ahead.
And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.
No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.
Was it your scores?
Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we���d save her from Ryan right?
[over phone] And Dwight.
Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!
That is a lot of liquor.
How much weight have you lost, Dwight?
So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.
Oooh! You can't handle the truth! [laughs]
I'd say like... 10,000 to 1?
You all right? [Oscar nods]
Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.
Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?
Sorry. Her day.
Oh yeah.
No.
What? [Karen's player shoots Jim's player, 'You killed Jim Halpert' appears on the screen, Karen giggles]
Good. Good.
This, man. I can���t do this to Pam.
Cugino's pizza.
Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.
[hugging Pam] [laughing] Oh my God!
Hey!
It's stupid. It's, it's just office pranks.
Ok, where is he?
Pam!  You don't think he'll mind if we take the shampoo, do you? [holds up large bottle]
Yeah.
Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert���s notebook.
Really? I thought I'd take Roy.
I'm so sorry, I forgot.
I have nothing to do.
Okay, okay.
Definitely we should.
[to Gabe] Is it?
Well, yeah I don't want to see her get physically harmed, that's for sure.
Private Room.
Do you know the industry is in decline?
Don't take it.
Yes.
So what's your strategy for this race?
So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume.  And a moustache.
Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
Closing ceremonies.
It's pretty good actually.
Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. [Michael and Dwight enter] Guys?
That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.
Good.
Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.
[whispers] Is that Nellie?
Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--
I thought you liked the store?
You ready?
[holds mug next to Andy's head] Make the face. [Andy smiles] Yeah, I don't see it.
Oh my god. That's so romantic.
If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...
The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
And how many kitchens?
Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first.
...and finds the... fake grail? No grail?
Okay.
Yep. Ah. Oh. [and skinned elbow]
But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
Productivity?  My numbers are good.
I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that's not happening, I'm not averse to just buying them all off.
Bye, Angela. All right, Kev.
We know that.
I remember that.
Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?
It���s Okay.
Hey.
But you���re saying there���s a chance.
Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
This is impressive.
This is dangerous.
[laughs]
You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.
Oh, thank you. I've been working out.
I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.
I wasn't. But thank you. [to Pam] Do you know anything about this party?
Holly, will you marry me?
Um... What's in the bag?
I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.
You don't even drink tea.
It���s pretty great, right? I mean, we���re coming along��� [to coworker] Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis���s timeline
Yep.
Dwight, he's gonna kill the store.
Microgement.
No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece?
I bit my lip at lunch today.
um��� I mean-
Yeah.
Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.
Alright.  I'll tell everybody here that you say hi.
[confused] Okay?
What are you doing?
Well you gotta figure this out.
[walks quickly to break room, opens cabinet and finds mugs of Oscar, Creed and Phyllis]
Absolutely not.
So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.
[hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done.
Oh Dwight, Dwight, [Dwight pukes on his back windshield]  Ohhhhhh!
Why would you start so high?
Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.
[on the phone] Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great. [goes into a private room where Pam and the doctor are, the voices are inaudible, but the camera can see through a window, Pam and Jim look in shock, they hug and Jim goes back out into the hall to call Dwight back, trembling] Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs! [laughs] Ohh! [goes back into the room to hug Pam]
What?
You have a better idea?
Time. Space. Gender. [Dwight mouthing words] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] No, that���s --
Obviously.
Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I���m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don���t worry, he���s the best in the biz.
Hello?
[Dwight and Andy stacking boxes rapidly] Nice.
Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. I'm gonna find him.
So Andy is in rare form today.
Yup.
Night-night.
Such a dork.
Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second.
Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.
Let's go driver! [clapping] Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...
I don���t know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I���ve been faced with a tough decision, there���s only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.
What have we got here?
No.
Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.
Mm-hm
Nice job, man.
Yep.
How are we doing on contractions?
Thank you, thank you. OK.
Half.
Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?
The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.
Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
Probably is.
What is that?
Here they come.
Puppet.
Looks like a red wire.
Uh, Michael.
If everyone would like to see proof.
Oh. Oh!
Six on seven.
Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out?
I know.
Get in the car? [Jim and Pam get in the back seat]
Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
No.
I don���t know how else to tell you, okay? I���m doing everything I can every week to bring home something...
When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.
No, I got it.
Okay.
That is not the expression.
Hey.
Well what if we can't do it quickly.
That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?
Went well?
So what is going on, girl in the computer?
Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- [texting on his phone]
Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?
Congratulations!
Hey.
And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.  [everyone claps and makes comments]
Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.
Oops, that���s my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
I can't believe you guys.  I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
Well, I think you look great.
Well, I mean, I don���t even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so��� These things go down all the time.
[wearing a tuxedo] I don't know. Is it classy enough?
OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad.
Sure we'll go.
Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!
Uh... Not a bad day.
Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
I don't know what you mean.
All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... [to Dwight] what is this?
It doesn't matter.
Okay.
You burned
Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.
Oh, okay. Hello. Hey, David. Sure.
I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So...  I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--
I'm just gonna write 'held back tears.'
College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
You're good... you're good at sales.
Oh, my God. Please.
I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates...
[driving] I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should. [sighs]
Yeah. [chanting] Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!
Hey, Kelly, it's Jim.
Hey, do you have a second?
Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?
Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.
Nah, you definitely weren���t kidding.  And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. [hands Andy slip of paper]
Sure, what's up?
Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
Yeah.
No.
Hey, man. It���s halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don���t. I���m in. Yeah, yep, I���m all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. [hangs up] Yeah!
All right, easy there, grandpa.
Yeah.
Here we go. [Meredith's phone rings. Jim and Andy groan.]
It wasn't me.
Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!
It is... more of a spicy brown, actually.
You will never want to leave your room.
[On phone] ...W R K.
Yeah.
I don't know about Stephen King, I mean...
[outside] So I'm still in the process of converting the garage.  It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect [opens garage door] for an art studio.  [Pam looks around and then looks at him] Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---
Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.
[on phone]  Hi, yeah.  This is Mike from the West Side Market.  Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah.  You have 'em in the warehouse.  Great.  What is my store number... six.  Wait, no.  I'll call you back. [quickly hangs up] Shut up [to Karen].
You gonna answer it?
Not really a rhyme.
Oh. Actually, it's just gonna be me.
So why did you come in here?
Michael, you didn't even know her.
Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?
[shaking hands] How are ya?
Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim. [shakes head] I got nothin'.
What?
Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica.
No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk.
Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here.
Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.
I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.
Uncanny. [everyone applauds]
I like the wild card.  I'm already liking the wild card.
[over the phone] How old's Kelly?
Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.
Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?
Yes, he is finally nigh.
Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.
You're creeping me out.  I'm gonna go.
Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
Thanks, Pam.
Woah, you guys going to lunch?
You are?
Can I change rooms?
Mm-hmm.
Um, just for the day while Michael's at my desk.
Yeah, I am too.
It's Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that.
So, how you holdin' up?
I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
That's impossible. [Dwight climbs through ceiling hatch] Dwight!
To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?
That doesn't matter.
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Okay, bye. [Jim turns back to Julius] So sorry about that.
Does Mose have nightmares?
Oh, great thanks.
Everything is going to be ok.
Oh, I don't know.
Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish?
Ah, you know me too well.
Nice. [fist bumps Kevin]
Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...that's it. That's really all we were looking for.
Michael, I really didn't mean to...
All right.
Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer]
Andy ��� this whole idea of our situation being just like war?  It���s just not true.  We just work at a paper company.  And you���re our regional manager.  And guess what man?  You don���t have to prove anything.  We like you as regional manager.  Andy if you don���t believe me take a look at what���s on my head.  I���m wearing a very pink hat.  I���ve been getting weird looks all day because I���m pretty sure ���DM does GB��� means something kinda sexual.  But guess who���s wearing them?  All of us.  Just for you man.  That���s huge.
Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. [Andy hums Six Flag ad] Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?
Yeah.
You got it.
That's a common mistake.
Yeah. I like talking to her too.
Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.
Wait, that's pretty weird.
Yeah. You're right.
No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.
So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back.
I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
[approaching Reception] Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?
It was not rotting.
[taps car] Lincoln.
Four months.
You did not force me to do this.
Wow.
Seriously?
For the North.
No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I���m not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody.
I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.
Amazing. How do I look?
[Sighs] I'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes.
You know what?  Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition?  I'd love to see that dunk of yours.
Okay.
Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.
[Christian Slater impression] So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, 'What's going on?' Well, you're not alone.
Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?
Okay, don't be gross.
[collects Dwight's weapons from around the office; holds up a hand scythe]
OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.
Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right?
Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
Hey, Ryan. How's it going?
Kev's out.
OK. careful, thanks. [takes bullhorn from Andy]
Thank you.
But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon.
Ah, ah, ah. Where's the 'please'? We're not animals.
[both laugh] You know that I was doin' this.
Wow.
Hmm, what?
[in the kitchen] Oh, here's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-
Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.
Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool.
What are you doing?
Oh, I don't smoke. Sorry.
Can't you do something about this?
That's-
Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim.
Hey, Dwight. I need your stapler.
Oh, yeah?
Punishment fits the crime.
Come on.
Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing.
Hey, Andy.  How are you, man?
No, no, no.
I am gonna need your advice [starts playing loud opera music, everyone can hear it, Creed starts crying] I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think?
Ok...
[as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.
Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping]
Nothing.
Beesly! Oh, my god.
That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
She looks older.
You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
Exactly. It happened in Big.
No.
OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.
Yeah?
[takes her hand] Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, you're so pretty.
Well, it's just a movie, Dwigt.
Hey... [reveal Dwight's Mega-Desk]
Uh, I think you dropped this [hands over piece of paper]
Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.
And impressions!
That's... not okay.
Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.
Okay. Michael. Could you beat up Michael?
I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.
...which I guess I'll be taking.
Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.
That's because Mark's my roommate.
No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.
Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or...
I'm trying, yup.
Alright! Let's do it.
Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving.
Stop shoving me.
No.
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
OK, I think I can help here.
Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.
Kelly!
No? Come on.
Okay.
You okay?
That���s pretty good. I feel safe.
What?
I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes.  Tadah!
And then you just changed desks, right?
Awesome.
Michael.
[under his breath] Nice to meet you.
Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it.
Hey, it's snowing.
Thank you for choosing me.
What!?
Did something happen Dwight?
[enters restaurant with Pam] Hey, Brian.
Michael stop. [sprays Michael, then Dwight]
But that doesn���t matter. This does. It���s the only thing that matters. We���ve had some really nice days together.
[to Dwight] Are you serious?
Dwight, come o-
But you said that you went out with her this weekend.
No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.
-I just don't know if I can do it.
Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe.
Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy.
Yep.
Hey, hey, come on, language.
So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.
Yup, I guess so.
Okay. [keeps eyes open]
[thinks] The friendships.
Do I?
I am not kidding. [shows camera an engagement ring] Got it a week after we started dating.
And say what?  'Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?'
Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
True love's kiss.
That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
Nice job, Beesly.
Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.
No.
No, no, don't do anything to them.
[reluctantly] Spinning would be more fun.
Could go either way.
Oh, that one was good.
Right? I was just thinking...
Okay.
Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.
I thought you had already... left.
[Jim and Pam are walking outside] I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.
Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel?
What kind of offer?
Wow.
Ready?
Great. Let me just...
In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment.
Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I���m gone.
[Gets up and looks out Nellie���s office window] He���s running!
[using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight]
If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, 'Well that's pretty premature to think,' but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.
The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? [Pam laughs] Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.
Topical.
Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now.
That's what I thought.
Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? ���Guten Prank��� number one.
Caleb!
Hey, how are you?
John Dillinger.
It is right. I mean, it's impossible.
[sees a pole poking out Dwight���s pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight's wallet]
I guess. [Pam smiles and walks away, then comes back and kisses Jim on the cheek] How dare you.
Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing.
The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes!
See ya. See ya. [Charles leaves] Bye!
Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.
Yeah. Super pretty.
That was, that was a surprise.
Hey.
Congratulations.
Right.
Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?
That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...
No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.
Cause there was dinner, by candlelight.
Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six.
[time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?
What's going on?
I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses.
Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.
Oh, you want me to be you?
Beesly, are you threatening me?
[to camera, holds up a bean] Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture [walking around the table] of who you think deserv-- who's that? [picture that Michael drew of toby, looks like a monster]
What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal.  It's Lackawanna County.  Our whole county.  And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch.  And I could work here for years.  And years.  [groan] Years.
Alright, I have my wallet.
What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.
So what are you going to do?
Okay, I���ll call you right back.
Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]
This is Jim.
No, Dwight. You���ll be doing the whacking.
No, I'm not making bread.
Oh, did the press ask for a story?
Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
Shh.
Ummm... no idea.
What are you doing?
David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.
Nope.
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone.
Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?
Please?
[Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course
So...ah, who's gonna take the dog?
Uh hum.
OH, that's great. I'm really happy for [starts to walk away]
...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but...
Careful.  There is no inner circle.
I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!
Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?
[Jim's phone goes to voicemail] This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.
Is Ryan gonna fire me?  I don't know.  I know that I've done everything I can, and I just brought in a huge sale, and... am I insane, or was this kid a temp two years ago?  Because in the three years that he's been here, I think all he's ever done is start a fire and grow a beard.  And it's not even a good beard.
Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right.
Hey.
You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
���..breast pain...���
[laughs] You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office]
Hmm...
You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?
Absolutely, I will do that right now.
We didn't have one scheduled.
What'd you do, Prison Mike?
Come on, who doesn't like a picnic?
Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much.
No, just kidding.  Seriously though, that's enough.
It���s a little, uh, personal.
At the Yankees game. Yeah.
Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything?
Hey! There she is. [Pam laughs] How you doin?
Tonight, hopefully.
Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play?
Love it.
Oh, man. Yeah, I can���t do it.
...in your condo complex.
[Carol walks through door looking upset] [waves] Carol.
Are you really gonna marry him?  [Pam nods] ...Ok.
Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.
Yep.
Hey Meredith, how you feelin'?
Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.
No, stop it.
So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.
[looks astonished] Ohhhh!
No, we've been dating for six months.
Pam, play by the rules.
It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!
Stop!
Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?
You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?
Paul Anka.
Hey.
That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.
What is going on?
Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.
Hi.
No, don't worry about it.  We'll just got double or nothin'.
Shh!
All right [high fives Kevin]
Of course I did.
What's that?
Three months.
Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.
I don't know. I don't know.
Oh... oh!
Where's Dwight?
OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...
Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one.  [Michael stands on podium] Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal. [everyone claps]
Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...
What?
[points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.
[on phone] I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
Yes, but not by kidnapping.
No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.
That's exactly what Wallace told us.
Really?
Uh-oh.
Okay.
Hmm���Heda. [alert] No.
Really?  Do you wanna get back to that?  I could go.  I should go.
You knew it.
Missed the last part.
[points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean?
Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...
Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
But you know I wouldn���t hire any of these all-stars.
Okay.
This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.
What?
I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  He's winning.  I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.
I'll use that.
Okay... [changes back to Glee]
When did you go there?
Well, I can't be the only one who didn't -- [sees mugs on Angela's and Meredith's desks]
You wouldn't dare.
I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...
Of course.
Well, turns out he actually made it up there.
Call me when you get in. [kisses Pam]
Which means absolutely nothing.
[attempts to shake Dwight's hand] Goodbye, Dwight.
What I���m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I���ve ever said.
Alright, here we go. [taps page] Michael...
He plays guitar, he likes naval history. He's a bowler.
Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it.
That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can ..
Yes.
Sure.
Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?
I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.
Okay.
A formal warning... [chuckles]
You���re not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I���m in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You���ve agreed to this.
You all right? What���s going on?
Pam's doing great.  Uh, she's ten inches dilated now.  Uh, sorry, meters.  Centimeters.  And she's also fully faced.  Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet.  It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.
Tuna?
It's okay.
Is he you?
No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.
This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
That's not the point.
I know.
Oh, you don't know her.
Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.
There is soda inside.
Well, Andy has a mug just like that.
Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, he's the drummer and the singer.
Right now?
There it is.
[to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay. [runs]
Mosquito.
Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?
[glances at Pam] Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.
[sighs and knocks on Michaels door]
That's Toys R Us, I think.
Aww...
[shaking head at the camera]
That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
Another worm? Like, are they friends?
Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it.
Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?
What are you talking about?
What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?
And the desk.
I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...
Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
[swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine?
Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly.
I have new baby pictures.
Do we all have our copy of 'Threat Level: Midnight', by Michael Scott?
You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I���m here.
Just [drops] and then you'll be saved.
Just do it.
Split the difference?
Yeah.
Um, no.
Yes.
What?
Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
It says 'workspace'.
And you'll be saved.
Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
She...
Uh huh.
Five movies. Go ahead.
Okay alright. [gets up] I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.
Don't open your eyes.
There is one condition, Michael.
Shawn Marion.
[to Pam] A banana?
I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.
Conference room everyone.
[flicks football onto Kevin's desk] OH!
Ahh, these aren't leads. What are they?
M. Night Shulman?
Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
No way. Let's do this [crumples post it and throws into mug. Misses.] Oh.
Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?
I just... couldn't wait.
Getting my wife a week off from work.
There's like ten green ones.
Yeah. Totally.
[laughs and swings his arm out which doesn't come close to touching the reception desk] I'm always this close.
Close.
Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
[looks shocked] W---Wow. Um. Well... okay.
Mmm...
Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open.
How?
Ryan? A little help?
You know what?
I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what the best play is. Do we tear everything up, or do we buy a horse on the Internet? I mean, I don't know what to do. What do you think?
Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so...
Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown.
Here we go.
Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why.
[to Michael] Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.
Ooh, what about, uh,  Dwight's dojo?
Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.
That's right.
Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so...
Ah. You brought in your doll collection.
Can we not?
Was it?
[Jim gets down on one knee]
How many L to a K?
Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.
[laughing] He's alright.
That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.
Great.
Okay.
I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.
A semester?
Just like that.
[peering nervously through conference room window] Oh, I don't have anything to say. I'm just hiding from Dwight.
Was in the green group.
Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.
Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
Let me guess, you think you should get it.
No.
No.
Mm-hmm.
What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.
That is a lie, that is a lie.
[whispering to Pam in corner of room] So, they know.
Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.
No, nope. What else? What else? You watch The Hills? What is Heidi thinking?
OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday.
In the picture, are you high?
I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill.
How embarrassing is it? That's not fair. Here...
No.  You got that backwards.
Alright.  Time to go.  Okay.
Hey.
I didn't, I'll look somewhere else.
Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm...
You all right?
Sounds like every other party.
Dwight.
You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.
No politics?
Oh, sure.
You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
Yeah, trying to quit though.
Alright, we're driving ourselves, actually.
Yup.
Good one.
It's not on your desk.
God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]
No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right.
Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.
What?
Strongly-painted picture.
Six-month anniversary. What?
[To Dwight] So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?
[Creed takes toy from toy drive box.] Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy
Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair.
Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.
So, that's... It's great.
And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says 'No, Jim, here's a way.'
Nope.
You were right.
Dwight! At least aim it.
I'm on it.
Eww.
OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?
He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!
[goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait.
Yep.
[Meredith's hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh!
I thought that concert was pretty great.
Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh.
Sorry.
If your client likes Italian food, you bring him to Cugino's.  And if your client likes a little action, you bring him a gambler.  And if your client hates Cornell, you bring him Andy.
I made a sale.
No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done.
Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
I���m sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment.
You could just be saying it to get the job.
Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.
Okay.
Alright. So, tell me all about it.
It's my own fault-
Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.
What was that?
Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?
I'm gonna pull the car around.
Not your birthday.
Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.
We should switch seats in order to...
Do you take requests?
Thanks.
No, that's not what I-
I know.
Robert?
Michael, Dwight would like your man meat.
The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn?
Why are you- How do you know?
Wow. Thanks.
And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.
No, that's Andy's office.
Oh, cool. [opens his plastic bag]
[as Dwight tries to take paper out from under him] Hey, can you not?
Weeknights are actually tough just because���
Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me���[gets interrupted by Andy].
I think you did.
Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.
What's going on?
Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?
Slowly, slowly.  Let's just get to the elevator.
OK, what are you --
Ok, sending.
Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them.
I���ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I���d be proud to take.
I don't know. Is it what you expected?
I guess.
Michael. Am I the first to arrive?
I just need some time.
Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?
Yeah, I know I should.
I didn't have anything, Jan.
Wow. Psychopath.  [Karen grins widely at Jim]
Sure!
Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?
She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.
Yeah.  Thank you.
Wow, can we make it a different moment?
Now he is saying 'Hi' louder.
Hey, so this isn���t matching up with this���and I���m not sure which one���s right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?
Why not?
Oh, that could be interesting.
Because we���re friends.
[On phone in hallway] No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.
By the way, they do need an extra day next week.
Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.
[Michael give Jim a 'World's Best Boss' mug] Thank you.
It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.
I don't really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.
Billy Joel Rock Band.
So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.
Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.
Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?
Okay, guys, guys, guys. That almost sounded like business, and we are trying to focus here today, okay?
Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-
No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not...
I don���t think it���s-
I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
Yep.
Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90.
Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who���s the strongest? Well, there���s only one way to solve that ��� flat curl contest.
Leave.
[dancing with Pam. They kiss] See, now you don���t owe me anything.
Obviously.
No. D-
Hey.
I miss you.
Nice job.
I'm not gonna eat it.
How many shoes do you need?
OK.
It's fire.
And then an older gentleman asked you 'Boxers or briefs?'
That's what I want.
Wow, simultaneous sale.
Nobody asked, Bob!
Oh, I didn���t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.
Co-managing is a give and take.  You have to pick your battles.  One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them.  He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.
Um... it's in Maryland.
Alright.
We have plenty.
Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.
You still do that thing?
Good night, Dwight. [Jim leaves, Dwight continues crying]
[chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.
[closes folder] You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?
So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with.
Yikes.
Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try.
Okay.
Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast.
I... why don't we go back to this animation.
Oh, yeah.  Don't worry about it.
How many buttons do you have?
And then you go to school for three years.
Catching butterflies.
Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.
What do we got here?
[hands Pam Andy's phone] Are there any messages?
Well, then why are you wasting everybody else's time interrogating them?
We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people.
There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.  And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.  Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay.  I believe she thinks she saw it.
Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. 'Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall.'
Nope we're not brothers.
I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too.
Wow.  You look--
Pam?
But you just met her.
Hey, how are you and Darryl?
Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]
You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?
Maybe Stanford would be cool.
No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I���m gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.
Hey man.
Okay.
We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
What?!
You did do it?
Alright.
Oh. Um���
[arm around Pam] Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.
[looks at camera] What?
Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?
[opens door to Gabe's office] All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again. [Gabe motions that he's on the phone] 'Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.
I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.
Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.
You���re gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy���s gonna record it. So we���ll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?
Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people.
Seventy and clear, that's nice. Where's that?
Most apartments these days have like three.
No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?
Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday.
Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into?
No.
I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy.
Thank you.
Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.
Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.
What?
I'm trying---
I think you're right.
Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days.  How's your summer?
The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
Absolutely.
Do you?
I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.
[getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks.
Do you want to play-
You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?
Um... I don't think so.
Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?
You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!
That's pretty cool.
Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.
OOH! Boom! Face!
[to Michael] Why is Packer back?
I am, too. Let me show you.
I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.
What? Yes, that is exactly what I mean. Wow. You are very good at what you do.
No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.
[Gently taps Pam on the forehead] Tied up.
No, I'm not gonna do that.
Oh, OK.
Oh, um. [pulls item from bag and hands to Pam] Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it.
Yeah. It���s real. It���s the only way you���ll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She���s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
No... sport.
That's not true.
I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah.
...Right. Spin-serve! [serves, and Dwight scores]
Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don���t want to meet that person.
Did you cry?
As opposed to...
Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.
Okay, wait, wait.
[growling] Nice.
Second drink?
Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but...
We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.
Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?
Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.
Okay, 'A,' Halbert. And, 'B,' I think a more appropriate statement would be, 'The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests.'
Nope.
You really think you can make it up to me with food?
[overhears loud monster noises] Its Monster dot com.  Singular.
This... is the future, because... This is the past. I���ve been through a lot of issues in my life. I���ve seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I���ve been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause]
Perfect!
I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.
We���ll talk about it later.
Oh, well, Dave is an adorable baby.
What was my worst first date?  Umm.  It was a couple of years ago.  It was a lunch date, actually, it was right down here, at Cugino's.  And we had just met, and we really hit it off, it was, it was kinda nice.  Umm, huh.  And, uh, then, as it turned out, it wasn't even a date, because she was actually in love with someone else.  So, best first date is also my worst first date.  Oddly enough.
No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you.
It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ...
[clearly just humoring her] No... way!
Not bad right. [swinging golf club]
Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?
When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?
Yeah.
No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.
Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works.
Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.
Thank you.
Frank and beans!
Ha ha. That's hilarious?
I just-- what?
A toast, better make it good.  To avoiding a class two felony charge.
Having a great time.
Big Red Paper Company?
[shoe falls while climbing ladder] Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. [grunts] Creed. I was never here, all right?
I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?
Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?
Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal.  While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?
I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...
Great. Where did you get it?
Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.
OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... [Pam starts laughing]... spy on our other branch. No no no.
You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.
Uh hmm.
You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.
We would really appreciate it.
You pet the animals and they pet you back.
Really? Does he do good work or--
What are you talking about?
Yeah.
Oh, great.
Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.
Andy revealed himself to be a double agent.  At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent.  And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent.  Oh, and it is 6:00.
You cut more than you had to, didn't you?
Dwight! Dwight!
Hi.
Later, Kev. [Puts French Onion Potato Chips on Pam's desk] Have a good weekend.
Today of all days...
Well, what if I just do this?
I'm really too tired to do this.
[at the Halpert residence as Cece twirls in the front yard, exiting front door] Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma���s got breakfast, OK? [to camera] We are going to Roy���s wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife���s ex-fianc�����s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it���s your wife���s ex-fianc��.
[nervous laughter] Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months...
Ponies.
Listen, this isn't a favor, all right?  This is a good idea. We all win.
Did they?
Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over?
I forgot if there was an 'e' between the 'l' and the 'y.' I still don't know.
Alright. Let's clear this up. [on phone] Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?
Nice.
Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that���s only gonna make things worse.
Oh, come on!
[goofy voice] Frank and Beans. [laughs] Always makes her laugh.
Oh, thanks man.
Louder, son!
Oh great, I have to cover?
Thank you, Dwight.
Can I get a drink?
Talla-nasty', very clever.
Stop it! It's gonna be great.
This is all we have.
Yikes.
Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?
Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?
���Together we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh.���
Um... 'Cause your condo's in America.
I'm sorry, did we or did we not pay for a show?
Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.
Oscar! Uh, what is going on?
Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
Resent you?
Oh man, that's crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.
I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--
Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.
I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win.
Pam?
[On the phone with Dwight] Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.
Yeah?
Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?
He... It's a crime fighting beaver.
Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings]
Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one [holds up paper]. Originally given by Benito Mussolini.
So, where are you shipping your foot?
That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.
All right.
Right?
Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?
Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance.
Ok.
No, no. I want to hear you tell it.
How far away did you think we were?
Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul.
Funny? No? Nobody laughing?
Whoa.  Whoa.  Wait.
I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp...
Michael, we only told our parents last week.
I don't think so.
Wow, that's not such a bad idea.
Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.
You ready?
Let's see it. Show of hands.
You gotta play along man.
But you hear the baby crying, right?
Hi! [Awkward]
Who are you talking to, specifically?
I think I���m a little too busy these days to s--- [whispering] Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.
Hey, and if you���re ever in Austin...
No, thanks. I'm good.
Hey... What?
Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
Hey.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, uh, later-ish.
We have discount prices on ink cartridges...
Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?
Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So���my pitch is���me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.
Nevermind.
Did my scores drop a little?
He's not a part of this. You know that.
For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin���
Dwight come on, come-
Exactly. You can do this.
Okay.  That is me, but I didn't order the cake.
Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
Well I do.
Bat birth control
Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then... [reading text message] 'How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight.'
Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that.
Well, then keep it.
Yeah?
Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of ���Pilot���]
Phoenix Sun's point guard?
No.
No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap.
I get back from work around 6.
Those are the books that sum up the other books.
It's really good to see you, man.
You're a psychopath.
I didn't sign anything.
Nobody!
Seriously!
David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
Where did you take that?
Nope. It's over.
Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.
Yeah, definitely didn't need help with that, but, yeah.
Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
Ooh, me three.
[imitating Andy] 'It's not freakin' funny!'
So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
Oh.
Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things.
Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.
Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]
Okay, great-
[long pause] Huh. This is a little out of left field.
[gets up to leave room, Michael gestures for him to stay]
OK...
No, I...
You do?
Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?
[whispering] Thank you.
Keys, keys...
Hey! [Runs after her and looks into her eyes] I... [hugs her tightly, Pam doesn't hug back]
Go get 'em.
De class���.
[reads demerit] 'Jim Halpert, tardiness.' Ugh. I love it already.
I wasn't here that day.
[in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff.
What?
No, thanks.
Okay.
Second line.
You coming down?
Ok, great.
Yeah, alright Kev why don���t you come with us?
Yeah. [Shot shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse]
Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually.  But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers.
Okay, okay, it's no big deal.  So you're not a computer geek.
What?
Yeah.
Good night.
I don't know if I can.
[Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing?
Aaah!
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by]
Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
Psst. You think this thing's gonna go much longer?
Oh, great. [reads] 'Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy.' Oh that's not good.
What do you mean?
We're going to Chuck E. Cheese.
Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.
What are you doing?
I'm excited, I've actually never been to Gettysburg. Uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so I freaked out and we turned the car around. But I'm older now, I can outrun a zombie.
Nothing.
Okay. This is it.
He's a jerk.
...Okay.
Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah.
Hey, crazy, um...so...that's it? You're just-you're fine?
I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork.
OK, here we go... Digest of business terms, CliffsNotes on business economics, and a sales encyclopedia.
Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that. [Dwight smiles at Jim] Really? Smirking?
Ok, thanks.
Why won't more people do that? [laughs]
I am.
Can I have a late checkout?
Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go.
You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?
Party looks fun doesn���t it?  Everybody seems to be in there having a great time.  So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
[Jim and Pam approaching the wedding venue] Is this his house?
Hey, you don't have to...
Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.
Yeah, we all really...
I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?
Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips.
No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.
This is gonna be awful.
Have a good game man.
That's really not cool.
Dwight, how's the hotel business?
Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?
Yes, yes.
Nice job.
Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.
Do they call you that?
Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away 'Survival Skills' and 'Self-defense.'
But I think it���s big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea���.which, by the way, I can���t wait for.
Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.
No. I can't. It was like, hours ago.
Oh, man, so many points being made.
Ooh, definitely in my top five.
Ahh! [ushers Michael into his office]
Yeee... (grunts in frustration)
I don't know.  He looks pretty scrappy.
Hey.
No. Okay. Um, I���ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
[conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
Ayyyy!
Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again?
Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, 'For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?' and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
What?
Why wouldn't you see him?  You work for him.
Don't..
Pam, I'm scared.  I'm real scared.
Good!
Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.
Go! Go! Go!
DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now.
[humming]
Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So...
I just got a text from Robert California that says ���bring your clubs to Florida���.
Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.
Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.
What was that?
Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.
All right, well it already went through, so...
So, what is this special project?
Nice.
Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.
All right, let's run it back.
Both.  They're both worse.
No.
We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?
Good. Please hurry.
Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?
Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I did.
[on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]
It's a pen.
Umm, hmm.
Ah.
A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?
[on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.
Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.
Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.
You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
No, we're good. Thank you, though.
Sorry.
Nope.
This is my desk.
Got it.
An Earl Grey tea for the lady.
Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?
[to camera] It's going really well, actually.
Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types]
What'd you get?
Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don't. Riveting.
Uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'Cause otherwise we can't do any work.
All right. [laughs] Awesome. Cool.
[off camera] Yeah, that's right.
What?
Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...
This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.
Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?
Just have Dwight punch you.
You don't know what it is.
On a wing and a prayer, mostly.
Notify the athletes.
We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an 'Andy for Manager?' pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.
OK.
Hold on, hold on. Is this him?
Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier.
Free paper.'
[to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know.
Oh, loves it.
What?
Which one's this? Perfect.
Nope, not a prank. I think it���s time for you to bury the hatchet.
Crying?
We're back in! Right?
Ok.
She's amazing. This is very exciting.
Dwight, this is crazy.
Haha...
Okay. The annex it is. I���ll be sitting at your desk if that���s okay with you.
Exactly. Here we go. Let's do it.
Hey, Darryl. [whispers in his ear]
Boom! [hands Oscar a business card.]
Alright.
No you don't.
Oh, hello Mater. Good news: I've married. Tell Fater. [hangs up] Such a nice woman.
Check this out though, spin serve. [serves, and Dwight scores] Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...
You've seen it, right?
All right.  Then... it's a date.
I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?
Austin Powers.
Oh!
I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.
Michael, just go park the car.
Showtime!
Oh no, we're just sitting here.
Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.
How much time do you have left on your break?
For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here...
I must...
Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.
Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don't know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.
Why's it smell real? [Pam shows him a hidden car-freshener] Ah... good one.
So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.
All right.
He just sent a text...
[cell phone rings] Excuse me, one second. Hi.
I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out.
Yeah, you never know.
Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.
No, why would you think that?
Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we���re scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix ��� me asking the boss of the company I���m abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash.  So��� problem solved. Thanks, guys.
[half-heartedly] Andy!  Nah, that's too far.
I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name.
You don't know.
Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.
Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?
Guys, the Afghanistananies.
What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.
Um...
Wasn't it...  It's kinda like a...  Like that.
That's not a good idea.
Dwight! [pushes Dwight's hands away] Why?
No, not exactly.
Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?
Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker.
Ready?
Hey.
Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
[snorts] Ew.
Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
My friend's basement. All right, ready to start?
Okay.
Is that you singing?
Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted.
Yeah I couldn't cut it down.
I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.
Okay, that's insanely complicated and the first thing I'm going to do is erase it.
So instead of working, you want...
Uh��� [clears throat] Well, it���s about Athlead. I���m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?
Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. God, it's freezing, I gotta go in. You stay though for like five minutes.
Where is it?
Oh, she's good actually.
[on phone] Hey, Brenda.  This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat.  And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right?  Um, so gimme a call back.  You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one.  Yikes.  Uh... give me a call back, I hope.  I'll talk to you later. Bye.
Pam.
Just all the - drama.
Those are the doves.
That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it's a murder.
Uh--
I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money.
Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?
Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?
Pretty sure everyone heard that.
Oh, I'm engaged to Pam.
All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this.
Thanks Meredith.
[stammers] I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.
That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.
Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.
Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.
What?
I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80's movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I don't do that, I think I'll be alright.
It's locked.
Okay, your move.
Great. [to a group of guests]  Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves]
Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
We should probably get back.
And there's my talking point.
What are you doing?
Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.
Well, you're probably dehydrated.
But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.
Nothing... nothing at all... it's all good!
There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.
[Irish accent] Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us.  Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.
What's that?
Bye.
Travel.  I've been looking forward to it.  It's gonna be... really nice.  Gonna find myself.
Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit.
Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?
False.  Black bear.
But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?
Yes.
Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.
Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.
Pam, I���m not explaining this to you-- Pam, I���m not going over this again.
Second.
Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.
Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay.
Um...
Oh.  Let me get it.
Wait, what? Come on!
OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
Another round, boys? Great. [Jim walks to the bar]
Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.
Ooh.
How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
I think Stanley just coughed.
Do you really have to do that right now?
No, I mean, great detective work.  'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?
Yes?
Hey.
Brace yourself. 3��� 2���
You gotta have sex with a woman.
Shut up.
[emerging from the Men's room] Empty.
Oh, I wouldn't-[clears throat]
Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch.
Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God.
You okay?
[laughs] Thanks Dwight.
So what's in the box?
Wow, that's great, because I need paper.
Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
I didn't... no.
Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.
Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman.
No, no, no, no, no. No.
No. We took a walk.
You are not my superior.
Hey, you got a second?
[talking on phone] You sound tired. Everything ok?
Because it is Halloween. So if you���re going to sing a concert, it���s a good idea to throw that one in.
Pretty good.
You should actually thank Erin, she's the one who agreed to babysit.
Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.
Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...
Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --
We were just kids.  What did we know?
Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.
We're gonna get him.
So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so...
How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.
No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.
You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
Yes! Phyllis! [claps] Phyllis, just put your foot right through here [lifts strap on box of paper]. Right through the flonk.
Well, by worst, you mean the best.
I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.
Yes, beautiful girl in the front.
Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!
Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.
What?  What?
Thanks.
And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
Didn't we kind of start it?
Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.
Let's start with the wildcard.
Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud.
Okay... [puts pizza into Dwight's mouth]
Wow, this is my lucky day.
Absolutely, will do.
No, it's not.
I have one, too. Jim. Jim, Is Jim. My name is Jim.
And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.
Yeah, no, I don't think you can.
The minister just told me that it���s tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
We can talk about that later.
Well, you know you can't actually poison him.
Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?
Hey.
Ooh, go easy with the shaking.
An urban thing...
Yes, okay. Bye.
So how does it work? It���s like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or���
I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.
Anything. You got it.
[clears throat] I am ready.
Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. True���[touches his nose] Oh no.
Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes.
Right.
Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends.
No. No.
That's OK, we're good.
Go crazy.
Oh no, no, no. That's ok. [Jim shoves some snacks in his pocket as he gets out of limo] Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center?
No problem.
Ok. Remember Spider face?
You see that?  I'm pretty sure she's...  Hi.
Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.
Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?
You bet.
Oh, one hundred percent.  We all want to see you tattoo your ass.
I will.
This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -
Where do you want to go for dinner?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
She'd be perfect for you.
Yes, let's have a word.
Unless you think he can���t handle it.
Hey. It���s nothing. Alright? I���ll text you when we get there. Let you know what���s going on.
I���m sure you did not. What was your question?
Because you've solved zero cases.
Hey hey hey. Everything okay?
Stanley doesn't have a moustache.
Mmm-hmm.
Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.
Alright. [Kelly squeals]
Yep.
Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen.
Hi.
It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. [Towards unseen cameraman] Is bold the right word?
Man.
Brown, shiny, painful bite.
You ok?
Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?
Uh, can you get this rundown for me?' [impersonating Charles]
All right!  [sitting down behind Michael's desk] I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but...
Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? [Karen smiles and gives herself away] Wow. Ok. You got me.
No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this.
Thanks.
Freecell.
Dwight?
What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!
Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.
How's it going?
Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.
Uh, my ex-fianc��.
No. [re-enters bullpen from kitchen.]
OK, Kenny.
You have to make the decision.
So, none of that tipped you off?
That's it. Or Mr. Peanut.
Five tickets on the windshield...  Hey.
Really?
Agent Michael Scarn.
Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about...
Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?
Why not?
Oh, Clark. I���m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.
[shudders] Whew.
Yeah?  ...  Oh.
Really?
All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player.
Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
Why don���t you start?
Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.
This is actually a big potential sale, so...
Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.
No, it- [high-pitched feedback as Jim starts to leave, feedback changes as he moves, turns over the mallard to see the listening devics, sighs, places mallard back on the desk]
Not even Harry Potter?
You look cute today, Dwight.
Are you sure you once knew how to do this?
And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
Michael...
They are terrible.
No, I'm not doing that.
That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.
Oh my God!
Okay.
OK
Yeah.
Do you?
Hey.
Shuckin��� the peas. ��You should go back to the first part, though. You are ��gonna ��cover for me?
Yeah.
Duh.
OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use [finds a mug] uh, oh -- Snoopy.
Okay.
It's the lever on the side.
He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.
[grunts] Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?
I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.
Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.
Ah, hey.
[sighs] Gross.
She is dating Ryan, I think.
Umm, what happened?
Aah! Ow!
So I guess I'll just... work on my short game.
No, can't help you now.
Oh, um... .I can't.
I don't know what else we can do here.
All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to.
Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we���re just starting couple���s counseling. Uh, which doesn���t sound any better.
Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? You���re clean, right?
Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation?
[enters] Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They���re going to make you pay for the fish, and��� they wanted to know when you can start.
Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.
Respectable?
Really for like how long?
You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
Absolutely, yes.
Bribery. Nice.
[entering office] Hey. So, we saw a new billboard.
What?
At a gas station. [oscar laughs]
Hey.
Yes, I agree.
Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?
Hey.
But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.
I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball.  Oh, how much?
I don't like that.
Maybe you should.
Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?
What?
And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.
[Michael, Dwight, Andy and now Pam are in the circle and training their 'weapons' on each other, Jim walks in]  Really?
Nope. I'm numbering the paper.
Yup.
Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?
You really wanna fight on Valentine's Day?
Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.
Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.
Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.
I'm sorry.
You did not know it.
The raise isn't real.
Thanks.
You do?
I bet I should. [takes cell phone photo] That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you.
I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.
Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.
Got it.
Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything.
Good.
You���re welcome.
[answers cell phone] Hey!
What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
Wow! There it is.
Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.
I just-
Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---
But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.
Oh, Somebody went in. That was a team effort, Pam.
Thanks.
Yeah.
And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat]
I miss that.
Yes, car seat's right there.
You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine.
I would prefer not to.
I know why you're doing this, Dwight.
Alright, I���m gonna go warm up the car.
Well, you seem to have this under control.
Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.
Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case���let���s get to work.
How old do you think I am?
Oh, no, no. No.
Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing]
Yup. That's perfect.
You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.
Meredith Van Helsing?
Cece���s really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
Um, you know what, I actually didn���t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.
Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
Is he OK?
You can't even do that.
Dave.
[entire office is chatting] I'm saying, all I'm saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying.
Yeah?
Ok...that's not...
Let���s not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you���re expecting a fax today, please don���t yell out, ���Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.��� Ok? That���s nonsense.
Gotcha. Alright.
What'd you do?
What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
Mmm-hmm.
Oh?
Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.
I'm on the phone.
No no no!
Flowers.
And I won't.
I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
Wow.
Okay.  Um... Got you something.
That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...
Sorry. That was a family emergency.
[as he and Pam flip their cards] John Stamos.
Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about? [Michael leaves]
All right, I'm gonna go now.
Okay.
Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever.
Right!
[As he's walking out] That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!
What's that?
Yeah, you can.
And of course, classy.
Is that it?
All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don���t worry. I���ll figure it out.
How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
Hello.
Michael...
Yeah, I think so.
Okay. Roy.
Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!
That's pretty good.
Oh, I like you.
You weren���t there.
Hey man.
Oh.
Is there really?
Hey.
Hey.
I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.
Sure.
Really?
Sure glad you're back.
Mm, hey driver. Why don���t you take us to 3030 Adams?
I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand]  Just the guys.  Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem.  I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.
Are you interested in her?
Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] 'The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert.' Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.
No.
You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
Easy.
[seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. 'Soo-ven-yay.' Mr. 'Jacques Soo-ven-yay.' Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
I���m not doing the Presentation.
Good one.
Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It���s really great.
Just check it.
I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.
Hey man. I am so sorry about that.
Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.
We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.
Okay.
[after Pam checks her cell phone] What's going on?
[getting up quickly to silence Michael] No, no. Nope.
Sounds good.
No, you're not.
Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.
Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some fire crackers and they start popping]
You sure?
Ten. It was the full ten.
What happened, did he do it?
The ocean.
Yeah. You know what? I���ll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.
Um... Whoa. [picks up ringing phone][in managerial voice] Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm  hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.
Oh. Hadn't noticed.
No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
[Andy playing the sitar] Hey.
Wow, I'm really sorry.
Today's a big day.  Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  It's got shag carpets.  I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting]  She's gonna love it.  Right?
Yeah.
Thank you.
True. Meredith.
[whispering, going into the bathroom with Cece] Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!
How would that work in well?  I just want to know.
Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier.
What?
What did he say?
What? What am I gonna do? I don���t ���
Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.
That���s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
Like hypothetically��� if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.
No way.
It���s, it���s nothing.
Probably.
Love you too. [hangs up phone, Pam sits on a bench crying]
That���s pretty good.  What about uh, for a thousand points?
Yes it is.
How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
Alright, alright, gang. Let's just settle down. You're yelling in her face.
And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand. [Michael, then Dwight raises hand]  Can I get you some punch?
Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?
The mob, maybe NASA.
Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.
It's still on a bike path though right?
I don't know. Hey, have you seen my baby?
Wow.
Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away]
Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim.
By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?
Only if you tell me what you're writing.
Hey, Dwight.
You're welcome.
Okay.
Is it me, or are we just a little off today?
But ..
Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.
See how easy that is?
Ahhh.
Sounds good.
No, she's not.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone.
I'm sorry, Phyllis.
That's not it.
What���s that?
Am I the only one that���s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
Okay. I���ll talk to you tomorrow.
Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking...
I did not see this coming.
Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
One second 'cause that sounds really good. Is jackass one word or two? [Dwight sighs] One, right? 'Cause, 'cause of the show, it's one.
Oh, Holy Mother of God.
Yup.
Ok, so that's a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. It's pretty smart, right? [walks into Vance Refrigeration office] Hi, how you doing? I'm Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.
Mmm hmm.
And Jim will say nothing.
Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
Hey.
Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.
Yeah?
Oh my God, David. That's horrible.
[Pam lights a candle] Wow.
Are they looking at me?
I mean, it's just that- [clears throat] You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you...
Fireball!
[points at bearded man] Who's that?
I'll just go later.
This rundown better be really good'?
For me, it was.
Well, I think you handled it pretty well.
Smasher!
No, not at all.
Right! [Jim laughs as he answers the phone] Hey, what's up? Everything ok?
[notices cleaning crew coming up to the gate] Cleaning people. Oscar. [everyone starts to walk outside] OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us.
Mmm-hmmm.
Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be...  Can we get a late checkout?  I don't...  I don't think she heard me.
I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.
I'm sorry?
Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?
You're welcome.
Good. I like it. You know what. Pretend to smoke. [Dwight pretends to smoke]
I ain���t fraid of no ghost. [Pam holds up drawing of a hand with the middle finger raised] Whoa!
I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
[Jim slams lunchbag on table] I just totally blew a sales call.
Well, we���re here. Perfect. ��[covers sleeping Phyllis with his jacket]
Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.
I win.
Till Death Do Us Rock.'
Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents...
Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it... [being pulled away by Pam]
Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?
[on the phone] Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.
Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes���and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that���s���an amazing gift.
Am I walking out?
Thank you Angela.
That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.
Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
Ah...[sees Dwight's wallet and open email] I'm gonna s- [see's Dwight watching from break room]
Si, senor.
I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.
What does Level Red mean?
[to the buyer] Hold on a second. [to Pam] The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about���
Okay.
Uh, Ryan can never know.
No, it's bad. Darryl canceled go-karting....
Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
Yep, Spongebob Squarepants.
[picks up the phone] Michael Scott here.
That's awesome.
Wow.
Right.
Can I go?
Solitaire?
I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything. [laughs]
Hmm.
Mose has been weird? That���s so unlike him.
Good luck.'
Damn it.
Kelly, you know what...
How are you, man?
Oh, OK.
Guy's going by. Shh.
Hey, I���m in Philadelphia right now.
A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.
How'd you get gum in your hair?
Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic.
What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
All right, guys. It didn���t work out for any of us, so��� we���re still on the same team. Let me get these.
Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
Oh, sorry gotta go.
I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.
Ok
You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...
Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?
Well, it's good to see Kelly's maturing.
Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy.  Thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Don't...
What about cars?
It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.
Well, I'm going the speed limit. So...
I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.
Darryl, it doesn���t matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.
Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.
Uh, what does -- what does that mean?
Oh.
Let���s do it!
It's not even real yet. And I'm not gonna tell her 'til it's real.
Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.
She could put the cup right there.
I don't know.
Wait, when was this?
[baffled expression]
Oh yeah.  Why?
You playing that game again?
So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?
You know this isn't real TV, right?
So I guess I can't get up.
[quickly shakes his hands back and forth]
Aww, best book?
Am I going down a road?
My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this.
Yeah.
Dwight tried to kiss me.
To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle.
All right, good stuff.
What are you guys doing?
I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.
Perfect.
I don't know how we'd go about doing that.
What do you know about boobs?
Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?
Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?
Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.
Well there is some bad news.  [accent] There has been another murder.
Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry. [Pam looks at Jim] Sorry. I think I'm just hungry.
[to camera] Didn't see that one coming.
And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.
[Windows reboot sound] Altoid?
Oh, are you firing Creed?
OK, thank you for ... this.
I think I got a pretty good sense of that one.
You're not having sex.
OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
Well we are here now, so let's just--
That is good.
Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.
Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
Really? Why?
Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?
I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa.
[holding up a sign that reads, 'Dwight picked the wrong day to put a wooden mallard in my office']
Oops. [hangs up]
Does my room have cable?
Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.
That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
Huh.
[Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you're going up there?
OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
Yup.
That's great
Jackpot.
No. It's cool.
Nobody tell him!
Yeah!
Oh, ok, cool.
Hey.
Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
After you sir.
I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn���t love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid���wonderful���boring���amazing job.
Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
Hey... [Roy lunges towards Jim]
I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.
You follow him on Twitter?
Good to see you.
Maybe we will someday.
Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way?
I'm just gonna get...
Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
Oh do you mean when I get the job?
That's it.
But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
[whispering] I don't even know who you are anymore.
Would...
I'm gonna help you through it all right?
No, you're not reopening the case.  The case is closed.
All right!
He hit the pole!
No, I'm not gonna do that.
We are doing worst first dates.
Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
That���s all right.
And I have started a business in Philadelphia. [Pam shrugs]
Thank you.
Second-in-command to Michael.
If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I���this will be so huge for our family.
Mm-hm.
No I'm not.
Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close?
He's good at his job.  And I like working for him.
[touches headset] Call you right back. What were you saying?
OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me.
What are you talking about?
[hugs Dwight] Congratulations, buddy.
Yeah, we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything.
Yeah sorry everyone else didn���t come.  I think they���re just tired.  With holes in their shoes.  And they have dysentery.
That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?
Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along.
I'm Jim, by the way.
If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah.
You know what? Yeah. Have at it.
Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine.  So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along.
Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. [Pam nods reluctantly]  And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date.
I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.
Fair enough.
Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company.
Ha ha ha.
Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20.
It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or...
Yeesh, how old is this ship?
Did you just change it to Gollum?
Yes.
Yeah
Thank you.
I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
So I guess I can assume that was personal.
Dwight!
Really? Way to earn it. Hey, Andy?
Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.
Is your password Frodo?
Pam, it just happened.
Oh, okay. Oh, do... that's what the tape is for. I didn't know.
Love you.
...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.
It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen...[Jim bites his lip again] You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!
Oh, no no.
Okay. Sounds good.
It is really special.
...and paper.
Not enough? I don���t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it���s against the rules but I���m gonna need a favor from you guys.
���Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you.���
Stop.
Really?
Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here.
I think you mean a girl's
What answers?
Animalian?
So, we should let him go.
I think today was a good day to have two managers.  'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing.  But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy.  It's because they're doing it for the kids.  And I get that now.
She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that���s fine.
[on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.
Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on.
Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
I don't think so.
We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn't do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that.
Okay. Thank you.
[sitting on a stack of paper] Yeah, well, if you're only free till three on Sunday and I can't get there till one, then it's gonna be pretty tight.
[sighs]
Right.
Probably just Kelly.
I'm just doing my job, man.
I am still in Philly, actually.
Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.
Yeah, yeah. Totally.
Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
He brings up two good points.  Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?
Michael - [Michael signs] Great.
Okay, I'm not doing every number.
Tom Cruise!
That doesn't exist anymore.
Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date.
Alright, let's get this started.  I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.
[front door slams, Kelly walks by] Hey, Kelly.
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
[waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?
Not at all. It should be Dwight.
Good. What? Nothin'
I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?
Oh yeah, yeah... hope that's okay.
I���m really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?
Yep.  No, I mean I really liked it.  I thought was uh, a fun read.
Oh-
Ding Dong.
Why is she here?
Yeah, it's a golf text.
Yeah, that's pretty good.
We need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
Oh, my God! Wow.
You have no idea.
Oh, come on, that sounds awesome.
Well... yes, that's probably what it is.  So what do I do?
I think you seem distracted.
So you have the directions.
Oh, I can do that.
Got it.
Thanks, Toby.
Pull up your pants.
Ok, ok, ok.
Guys, this isn't some elaborate scam, okay?
Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?
What's up?
Pretty amazing.
Yeah, well, you know...Cornell.
[walks in, see's Oscar, Stanley, Creed and Kelly sitting in Michaels office] Okay, I thought I saw people missing.
That's very...
[under breath] Oh, no, not while I'm here.
What?
You doing alright, man?
Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
Who here heard it from Ryan?
Yeah, right. I mean, unless they���re willing to pass some tests.
Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, she's so beautiful!  Oh, my God.
Okay, listen.
Ah, dinner.  Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.
What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. [pulls up Dwight's game] Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.
Nope. Can���t accept that job. It���s not a real job.
Come on.
Mmum, still wrong.
Well, the group tour is now leaving, then.  Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows.  I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.
That seems inconsiderate.
You... owe me.
How you doing?
Right, cause that's what we are talking about.
Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think.
[in the conference room] Hey Pam, can I see you for a second?  So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day.  So he generously offered to wash our car.
19. [grunts] I had a really hard work out this morning.
Hey, Kev. How you doing?
Why?
Okay.
Nope.
What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!
Well, I'm evolving, Pam.
Honestly, I don't mind. [long, awkward pause until thermos is empty] Did you want me to wash it for you or...
Oh. Right, that style.
I'm gonna say fifty.
Hey, how's it going?
Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.
Wow That's terrible, I really liked him.
What was you? You were the leak?
What did I do to deserve this?
Alright.
Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.
All right.
And, also, any forms that you are going to need...
Yeah, oh, I know. Looks great. [Dwight throws the purse over his right shoulder and gets back to work]
You embarrassed me.
Yeah.
Why don't we head in your office to talk?
Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  I'm glad.  Any real potential there Beesley?
Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?
We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.
You didn't hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
Are you not gonna put out the torches?
Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?
Awesome, right? [leaves]
No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.
So...
Does that include 'That's What She Said'?
Oh, and I get to carry it.
No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think.
Oh.  Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.
Okay.
Actually, yeah.
Thank you. Your mom is a treasure.
Yes.
Absolutely, I do.
Hey.
Hey, how is... Toby?
Is this real? [Pam dumps Michael's screenplay on Jim's desk]
I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.
No.
If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
Hey! Back here.
Nope, that's okay.
Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. [Jim puts a pencil into the time clock and pulls it out broken in half] We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.
So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?
It wasn't me.
You know, it's getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.
On what?
Great work Dwight.
No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular.
Stop [sprays Michael]
No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay [others enter] Hey everybody!
Post-it Notes. Wow, that purse holds a lot.
No. No. Definitely. It's ..
Wish you were home.  Uh, anyway...
OK, I'm going back to work.
What are the two levels?
Yeah, was it 10? Yeah, I have it on a mix tape from junior high.
Did you say 'she?'
[talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?
Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?
Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises.
[under his breath] Didn't think you'd notice...
Are you a cocktail waitress?
Thank you.
What are you doing?
[pulls Dwight's arm down] Okay. That's vivid.
Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.
[scoffs] I... will never say a word.  And now, we are even.
Alright...
He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
What's going on?
No, no, you won't do that. Nope.
Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5:00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes.
[on phone, leaving a message] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. [hangs up and exhales sharply]
Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
How can you even be sure?
Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.
Toby.
You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks.
There.  Now we're even.  [Pam laughs and mimes taking a picture, they kiss]
I don't know about, love...
You want to talk about it?
What?
[to babysitter] So... how do you guys know each other?
Yes.
No, see? Right there, that���s the problem with your method. ���Cause I still don���t know if you���re saying ���Sea World��� or ���see the world,��� and it���s taking a lot of time to explain it.
Those are like my favorite movies. I didn't really think you could win Desert Island, but I think you just did.
Hey, whoa, Michael...
I did, yeah.
The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty.
No. Thank you, though.
Cece!
No, no.
Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try.
Great. See ya' then.
You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.
Dwight, you can���t just hire someone ���cause they���re your friend.
Personal conversation.  Seventeen seconds.
[Pam approaches as he sits in his car]  Hey.
Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.
Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.
Oh, yeah, it sounds like it.
She's not your grandmother, is she?
Oh my god. That's less romantic.
One Charlie's Angels. One. Let's go.
So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?
Oh.
So then, why didn't you do it?
Nah. Might as well do it now.
It's not really food, right?
I'm sorry what are you whispering about?
What do we have here?
I'm gonna go to my desk.
[on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]
But what have you learned about her?
We can't figure that out.
You really want to do this?
We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.
Pam, it wasn't her.
I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-... [Jim bites his lip]
Stop. I'm a barista in your fantasy?
Ok, I said average.
[on phone] Hold on one second.
Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool.
Exactly.
Anything. [Dwight begins to fill his new purse] Good. Yup.
Have a good night.
[coughs] Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one!
Well it's just that you had no hair on Friday.
Uh-huh.
That's pretty funny.
I thought it'd be funny.
I really don't know.  How you doing with all this?
Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work.
Well, the joke was on you.
Mr. Beesly. How are ya?
Yup...
What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
Nope.
Okay. And how do you feel?
Nope, just going to see Pam.
Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
No, actually.
Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.
Uh, it's in the lot.
I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.
Hey, come on.
You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.
With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number.
I don't think you understand -
Great!
Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.
Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings.  Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.
[gets engagement ring from his pocket] Hey...
Oh, I can't beat Darryl.
Uh hmm.
Wait...
Ah, they moved the shower.
Um, what's going on here?
All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.
Is there anything --
I don���t know how else to tell you.
Oh boy.
Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.
Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
Oh no.
I know. And I can���t do it.
Ok, Roy?
OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.
Did ya?
Look, We're in Puerto Rico, so-
Right.
Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults.
Ah, well I think I'm gonna see Katy.
No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.
Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small-[pointing to Angela] Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!
Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.
Two minutes...
I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...
Yep. [shuts door behind him]
Yeah... it.s scary.
I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?
Wow. [applause]
No.
Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
[on phone] Andy?
How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.'
Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
Everybody's birthday.
Oh.
Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
Yeah, woah. [deeper voice] Yep, absolutely, go ahead.
A what?
Mm-hmm.
It���s from the teapot. Everything you���ll ever need to know is in that note. [Pam reads the card] Not enough for me? You are everything.
You knew it the whole time, buddy.
[impersonating Fonzie]  Ayyyy!
What is happening?
Fine.
[hushed voice] Uh yeah. Trust me, I���d rather be with you guys.
Nope.
Wow.
Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.
This... is Parkour. [turns laptop to camera, shows Parkour instructional video] Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. [Michael is shown climbing/walking on various objects in office] The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.
Mmm... I'd prefer to sit in back.
Yup, it's, uh, four o'clock.
[puts his phone in his coffee mug and calls Gabe]
Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own
Andy, you've gotta be kidding me.
[A note is on Jim's computer that says, 'It is time. Parking lot at noon.' Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]
Hey, do you guys have any other games?
And you should.
Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but it's always buried behind like a ton of black licorice? [points to pile of candy] Bought it all. Now it's like red city in there. So, enjoy it.
Okay. We���ll, just forget it.
We don���t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-
When did you need that rundown by?
Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
What do we got?
Yikes.
Yeah.
[Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell?
Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that.
[laughs] What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?
Please do.
Nope.
We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just - [blows air] - all in.
Yes.
No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back.
See, that's weird.
Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who���s excited?
[motions for her to follow him] Come on.
Yeah?
Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!
Tell me about it.
Oh, thank you!
Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep.
Ohhh...
No, I don't think so.
Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.
That's not what I meant.
I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.
Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.
Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.
Sounds tough.
OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing: I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party.
So...
Oh, come on, Pete! God, that���s just sad. If he doesn���t watch himself, he���s gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.
All right.
Wait, what?
[to Michael] It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
All right, what the heck? Let's do it.
Okay, today. 5 o'clock. Closing Ceremonies.
I was gonna go with this one.
This is great.
Why'd you do that?
Michael! Michael, pull over!
Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.
Those flowers are nice.
Bye.
Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
Left.
Oh, my God, thank you. [hugging both] Thank you.
Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'.
Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
Oh, God. [hangs up phone]
Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. [Everyone talking Phyllis pours Jim some eggnog, as Daryl walks in] Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?
Okay. Phyllis.
We'll look into it.
No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal.
Oh, nothing.
Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.
Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.
Michael, I'm just trying to --
Nope.
Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies.'
I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again.
What?
Nice. [they bump fists]
What the heck? Is that, uh... [bends down, cuts phone cords with scissors]
Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...
Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something.
Wow.
What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone.
What a night.
Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.
I have nothing in common with Plop.
And who cares?  It's a stupid veil, right?
Nice!
I'm a drunk driver.
[softly] Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.
Fantastic.
No... I think it's a great idea.
What was that?
I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]
You are bleeding through your shirt.
Yeah.
Pam?
Well, I'm neither of those things, so...
This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, 'just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.'
Forget it. It's just a dry erase board.
Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over.
Do we have a conversation scheduled?
What?
Be honest.
Alright.
What is happening right now?
Boyfriend.
I think I did a pretty good job.
Alright.
[explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it's a tradeoff.
Hey!
Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.
Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine's Day.
[Jim Face]
Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.
What about, uh.. [points at Meredith]
You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.
Okay, so what do you want to do?
I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
Yes.
Wow.
I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves.
Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Which one?
Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight���s night, okay?
It's broken right, he can't...
A small blonde woman?
Ok.
Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.
Yes.
You come so prepared. Aspirin.
And I don't support her choice to hit you.
It's, okay, it's Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.
Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?
Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything.
Oh, good.
I don't think we need opposed.
Mmm.
All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.
Okay... Holly's back.
Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.
[Dwight imitates the 'Jim face'] Look at that.
Michael, can I talk to you in your office?
Why?
Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen?
Perfect.
You don't have to lie.
Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.
No, no, dude, no.
So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager.
Yeah, it's all right.
[opens phone] Hey. I saw you called.
I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy.  But I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  [reading from various books]  Five to seven minutes.  Five to seven minutes.  Six minutes.  Different, but not really.  Five to seven minutes.
Wow, what do you put our chances at?
Um, [gives Pam a look]
Yes!  Angela!  Please...
What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?
Rank each person individually?
I'm trying everything.
Wow. What have we got here?
Oh, tomorrow, that's gonna be tough 'cause I already laid out my outfit, so...
Actually it sounds like you are.
All right.
Potential future nonsense.
Hey, Amy.  How ya doing?
Glass of water would be a start.
Okay. I can���t say that that���s not fair.
Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.
Then you did nothing wrong. We should go.
No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, 'world's longest engagement', um, we're all expecting it, you know?
[continues working]
Either way, Dwight��� I can���t be there for you. I���m sorry.
That's right.
I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?
And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green.'
Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.
Okay.
Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...
Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?
Hm. Really tough call.
He's gonna throw up.
That's ok.
Nope. Baskets have it.
Total nightmare.
[Group chants along] Pie! Pie! Pie!
Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
Thanks man.
No, can't.
[flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?
So what do you think?
Ok, so promise that you'll wait till we leave the parking lot before you go to the bar.
[listening to and editing Jo's book on tape]
Mmm, that's where you're wrong.  I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require.  So, I think we should go get some.  Now, please.
Hey, uh, does Mr. Nortman still teach here? He's a jerk, right?
Who doesn't love that?
The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
Alright!
That's nice.
Hey, how's it goin'?
Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
And stuff... yeah.
Thanks Phyl.
Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.  [someone dims the lights, signifying that it's game time]  Ok, see you next week.  Bye.  [to Karen] Again?
That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right?
What?
So Pam was right?
If this job is in a well, I don't want it.
OK.
I just don't know if he's presidential enough.
But if not, there's always the army. The infantry.
That���s not it.
Hey! Can I talk you? For a second?
Bye.
Only two hundred dollars?
Hmm? No.
Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?
Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you���re not the best with the phone.
What is that chestnut?
I���m sure he���s just nervous.
Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?
What are you doing?
Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don't worry about it.
Screw ���em.
Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.
I love you, too.
No-no-no-no-no.
Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.
Who is this?
Best Christmas ever.
You did not have sex with Pam's mom.
Yeah, I know.
5 dollars.
How long is this? [flips through pages]  Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings.
[quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.
[while Dwight and Kelly are arguing] Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... .
Is that the buzzer from Taboo?
Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.
Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.
Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.
OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.
Forward, definitely.
Michael, did you say anything?
You didn't set up your BlackBerry, Dwight?
Hmmm, I don't think so. Nope.
[pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
[puts fabric softener into cart] ...What?
[drawing two family trees on a whiteboard] Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through [draws a question mark] delusion.
Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.
Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.
I was just... I'm in love with you.
Still no.
Big deal.
You mean Kevin?
Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright! [knocks on side of truck]
[to Dwight] Nice.
Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
Who?
Stanley, are you listening to music?
It has been, yeah.
They think it was Mose.
[taking away Dwight���s handset] Go ahead David, I���m listening.
Alright. Great. Thank you.
I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.
Oh.
Michael.
He's fine. He's indestructible.
Hey, Dwight. What's up?
[talking on phone] Sure, I can hold.
We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.
It's Mose. Who do you think it is?
What are you doing here?
Alright, well, we're never leaving the house again.
[smelling the stink] Oh.  Wow.
You got it, you're so close!
I'm not doing that. I'm just explaining.
Kathy wants to leave our clump?
Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
Perfect.
Yeah. No. Good.
Dwight. This, [picks up balloon] fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?
Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.
Definitely can't do that.
It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.
Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?
Big tip.
Wow. Win-Win.
Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.
All right. Good to be back.
Yep.
Are you really sure we should be leaving?
Um, like stapler tennis or something like that.
OK, sure. Let's do it. [Pam laughs]
You did approve it?
[confused] What? [Darryl points at his thermos Jim has been using] Oh, man! I'm sorry about that.
We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.
I think I'm gonna go.
You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.
Lets just go.
Totally reasonable.
Hey. I was just about to call you.
Of course I read it.
[Pam starts sipping an empty glass] I think those might be empty.
I think she's awake.
I gotta go do this.
Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over.
It���s great.
Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.
Unbelievable.
Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night.  So...
Oh yeah.
Kevin, do it.
Michael.
[on the phone] Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!
I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
And then we checked the fax machine.
[watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They've been in there for 45 minutes.
[after Pam has another contraction]  That's seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.
Ohh! Good-bye.
I can't. I just got a manicure.
Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. [holds up same book] I've only sold one copy.
That did. Pretty huge laugh.
Right here.
[hangs up Michael's phone, leaves room]
Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?
No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place.
Love that one.
[on voicemail] Hey, it's Jim.  Leave a message.
Eh, she's nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
Yup.
[Michael playing air guitar on pool table] Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this.
Okay.
Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?
You play? [referring to keyboard]
So, you used to share that cubicle with Kelly, right?
Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?
Can I have a raise?
Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he���s gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--
Sure you don't want the teapot?
I don't know what you're talking about.
But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
Oh��� okay. Where would we go?
Or zipadeedoodaah.
It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.
So it's going great, sounds like.
Well, we're really happy.
I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.
That sounds bad.
Stop! Stop!
Pam? No!
You writing your name over there?
An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?
God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?
I think I know the problem.
I...  Pam, please.
Oh my God, Dwight, put that down.
Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
[on Bluetooth] Testing, testing. Hello, everybody.
Wait, I'm serious. It's happening.
You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also? [Pam nods] Yes we will be doing that. We'll be getting a dozen.
[a text tone goes off] Is that my phone?
Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head]
Oh my God.
Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?
Yeah. Even you.
Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.
Okay, you know what?  I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?
Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.
Wow.
Okay.
Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.
Right.
I'm not single.
[raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?
The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... [shrugs] Oh well.
Still want that.
You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good.
That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...
That would be fun.
It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out.  We're not going under.
Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He���s putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I���ve done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight���only good surprises. ���Guten Pranken���. [chuckles]
See you tomorrow, Dwight.
Yeah, I���m here. Are we all on?
Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, 'Mom, there's a ghost in my closet.' Now, you say one of two things - one, 'You're just having a bad dream,' or two, 'Let's go see what it was.'
Come on, man.
[to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.
I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.
Yeah. Yeah. It���s a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to...
Oh, [points to Cindy] she's asleep.
See ya.
Hey.
Hey.
I���ll call you when I get there.
Hey, alright.
Everyone. Everyone just keeps looking at me.
So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]
Nothing.
So.
Thank you, accounting department.
Nothin' much what's up with you?
Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?
But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.
What's going on? Where's the belsnickel?
Ah, I'm sure they're all great.
Nope.
That's harsh.
What does that mean?
It's all gold.
[Dwight hands Jim a piece of paper] Oh, what's this?
Here you go again! What is your deal today?
You���re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh���
[yawning] What about an energy drink or something?
Oh good, so we don't have to work.
Okay, you know what?
Yeah, I'd say she's happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8:00 AM.
No. Let's talk for a long time.
I just didn't, you know, want a deal.
Forget it.
Oh, they're my client.
He welcomes you.
[Windows reboot sound] Dwight, want an Altoid?
I don���t know, for such a crazy number I���d like something pretty crazy.
Well, that is because that is the gift that keeps on giving. Oh, my God. I left today's paper on my desk.
Right.
Michael stop.
I���m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You���ve got a regional manager.
Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.
No, you're making this up!
Well I think Meredith was just --
That's cool.
Great.
Yeah, yeah.
We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.
Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.
What are you doing?
That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
I have no idea.
What a great year for the Dundies.
Hey, how's it going?
Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.
Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.
No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so...
Shoot.
That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.
Did it!
Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
[gives Dwight a high five] Great.
No.
[over phone] What?
All right.
You haven't heard our theme, though.
Right.
Did you break the shredder Kevin?
Hey.
No thanks.
Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.
Yeah.  Kinda feel bad for her though.
No.
Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical.
Whoops.
I'd go with that.
Mmm-hmm.
Do I have any say in this?!
[after a pause] That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.
[back to Pam] Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.
What do you call it? Schruteball?
Mmhm.
Could, keep that down.
Hey, Ryan?
No, thanks. You having fun?
It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.
So, terrible idea.
Peepa.
I'll call you when I get in.
Yup.
If this doomsday device goes off...
I think I got it right here.
What?
That was really rough.
Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?
I gotta get out of this dress.
Uh, I can't get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can't...
Yeah, I can't... really can't move him.
Yes.
Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis.
I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...
Kev!
No, I don't think I can...
Alright. [Jim's phone rings] Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?
Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
Mmhmm.
You set the bar so high.
Ok.
Truce?
Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me
Thanks, thanks Dana.
Oh!
Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.
Yeah, it does, actually.
Wow. I think you're bluffing.
You can't do this.
Cool.
And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.
She was always engaged.
But I know how to spell it.
Guys, what is going on?!  [Pete and Tom burst out in laughter]
Hey!  Welcome back!
I'm the one who complained about you.
Justin Timberlake?
One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?
OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.
I know.
No. What party?
[Jim face]
Okay. Have you ever seen the movie Sixth Sense? Maybe you are already dead.
[waiting outside the bathroom for Pam, he is holding a hand-picked bouquet of flowers and pacing] These are for you.
[hovering over Meredith's desk] Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.
Please stop.
Hey. [Andy pushes things aside and sits on top of Jim���s desk, kicking things in the process.]
Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?
Just steer more now.
Oh, I'm so glad you didn't.
Why?
What about Oscar? Could you beat Oscar?
No.
Closed. [Michael leaves his office, gives Jim two thumbs up, which Jim returns]
No.
You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.
Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he���ll be calling in any second.
What���s up?
Mm-hmm.
What do you think of Kelly?
Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.
That's him.
No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.
Okay.
You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?
Cathy wants to leave our clump?
What?
Hey, Kev.
Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.
[to Jordan] Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.
Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.
I promise you, we don���t need a warning-
Sally.
Do you honestly believe that?
Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.
Great.
Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.
Did you feel like crying?
It didn���t have a buster sign around him?  Why don���t you draw him?  Why don���t we see this whole thing.
[mouths] C'mon!
How do you hate it? It's a cake.
I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- [pulls out a pie chart] How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.
Oh my God.
Wow.
All right, guys, stop.
[overlapping with Pam] Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed.
Thanks, yeah.
Don���t-- don���t-- don���t pole people with knives.
No, you what, seriously, you should have it.
Yeah!
I looked at you coming around, and I said, ���Wintergreen.���
Don't. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!
Just keep him awake.
We should help him out. [Jim and Pam each take a French fry, eat it, and then look toward the bathroom]
I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.
Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.
Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?
I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.
What?
Chicken, hot dog, burger.
OK, great.
Well, is that it? Or?
Yeah, okay.
Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo���s here. Let���s do this. Change if you need to.
Yeah, we did. Hey, how long���how long do we think that���s gonna take?
Oh my God! You are so drunk!
Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
Conference room?
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
[On business call] Yeah.
Really?
Yes. They totally do.
Alright, here we go!  You're doing great!  She'll be here soon.
Oh, god, nature, please.
I'm sorry. This is for a news audition?
Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.
Hmm.
Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.
It's my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello?  Well that's great. [hangs up phone]  Turns out the paper was there all along.
Oh, just somewhere in the Poconos. I was just surfing.
She said lots of things.
[laughs] Um, ok. [thinks but says nothing]
OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.
[Philip is crying] I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?
Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it���s a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...
In Philadelphia.
Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go.
Oh thanks, Phyllis.
Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?
And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.
She dies.
Yeah.
We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on.
I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.
Can't do that. Unsanitary.
Nope.
Penny for your thoughts.
Terrible. Totally unconvincing.
If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
Well, there is no inner...circle.
[expletive]
I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.
So happy right now.
[on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.
Every time there's a silence, your brain's like 'Heh-heh-huh-huh' [imitating crying].
You know, truth be told, I think all you���ll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I���m gone.
Ok. Bye.
That sounds fun.
Actually not.  It was really so-so.
It's not my favorite...
Sorry. I���no, no, no, what I meant���what I meant actually was���
Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain.
Right back at ya.
[at company picnic] All right, you ready for this?
For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.
Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-
What are you doing?
You mean on a weekend?
It's all good. Are we all good?
Yes.
Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.
No, I didn't.
What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.
Yeah, gotta eat somewhere.
No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar?
Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.
Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you���d ever set foot in in this town?
What's that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don't, because I've got my eye on you.
Really?
Sounds good.
Mm!
Goodnight, Michael.
Okay.
Hey.
Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks.
Yeah.
Yep.
���Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.���
No, not more than anything.
Oh! Goal!
Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.
And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?
Oh!
We're gonna go get him.
See you later.
You're a jackass.
I don't know because I everything I own is there.
That's what who said?
She's engaged.
Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.
Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.
[while sighing] I suppose I am.
Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so... [imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles, Michael comes over by Jim laughing]
Okay.
Yeah.
Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.
Okay, here's uh, this is very simple. 'Dwight's Workspace,' nice.
[clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up]
My condolences.
[singing the intro to The Lion King's 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight'] A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
It was an away game.
No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard.
[to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
Really did [Text bleep] He responded L-O-L.
Whoa, careful, careful.
Then why the question?
No! No!
Are you serious?
I am not lying.
Hey.
What?
Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.
Yes--
Well, you're driving, right?
K, Kevin, are you saying ���See the world���? or ���Sea World?���
Ok, he didn't fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.
It's not hilarious, but...
Okay.
Well, Pam I'm not gonna lie to you, he's chances are none. Um, he's 41 years old, he is losing his hair and his cell phone ring is 'Mambo #5.' So...
Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied.
Okay.
[mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?
Yeah. Okay, maybe.
Wow. [cup tinkles]
Have I not proposed to you, yet?
Now, wait a minute.  You're not gonna punch a wall, or me, or anything like that if you don't win the point, are you?
That's increadible.
Right.
A place?
I'm so sorry.
[chuckles] You got it.
Oh my God!
Hey, you have a second?
...It's something to think about.
This was my decision, not yours.
Nobody's for.
Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be
What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
Hey.
Okay.
Okay.
[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm excited.  Oh, definitely.
Wow, hey.
Oh! There it is!
Yeah that's true.
Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]
You all right?
Feel better?
He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash.
What kind of pizza would you like?
We were.
Nope, not at all.
What happened to you?
Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?
Now, were those for the team?
What?
Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.
Oh, nothing.
Umm...
You're only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but.
Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
Okay, you know what?  You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.
Okay. I���ll see you in a little bit.
No, fake girlfriends are always wrong.
Okay.
Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out.
Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.
No, like baseball. A baseball team.
No.
He's not a real candidate.
I love you.
[pushes Dwight's finger away] Just, easy.
Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out.
Oh, I'll walk you out.
Alright. I will definitely do that.
But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.
Yeah, I never even knew that part of the office existed. [Pam chuckles] Hey, who's that guy? [Jim points to Stanley]
I know.
I love Star Wars as much as the next guy���
I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.
Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?
Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else.
Okay.
I'll do it.
OK, great.
I'm good. How you doing?
I love you.  Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!
[smiles, looks to Michael]  Really, nothing?
Okay, I���ll do it.
[phone ringing] You gonna answer that, Kev?
You are?  [Andy hisses] A cat?
Sure.
No? Nothin'?
I can't.  She's too strong.  She's, careful, though.  You don't want to break it.
Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.
Nope, he means tuna dog.
Too, too loud. Too Loud.
Come on Dwight! Use words.
What? No.
I have no idea.  We went right for the copier.
You didn���t force me.
Oh, well, that's coming. [smiles]
Nnnno.  Uh, turns out, it was just a really bad idea involving fire.  But I think I fixed it.
Good luck. [closes door and locks it]
Pam? Get us back into it.
Hold on one second.
Oh, crap. Were those yours?
Okay, this is the second time in two days that the website isn't working.  Do you guys know anything about it?
Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years.
Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret.
Well, congrats.
[picks up phone] Hello?
No.
Not that, don't...
[seeing Cece gone from the couch he left her] Uh, MeeMaw, where's Cece?
[telephone ringing] [shows note to camera 'It's OK. She'll call back!']
You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.
Back door.
Damn it guys!
What's in here?
What do we want?!
And I found out that there's a bus at 5:00 a.m.
All right.
And that's when I knew. You?
Thank you, Meredith.
I just wanted to say hi.
You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
It will be Angela.
Right?
Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we don't need a new system though.  Happy with ours.
You're messing with me.
[on phone] Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background]
Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
I have noticed that we--
My home office, this is it.
What are you talking about? You're not the boss. Andy is. Andy?
Mind if I join?
1870's...
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm aware of that.  But he's also being super annoying.  And I'm not a perfect person.
What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?
Why is that, why is that weird?
Alright Pam, alright [gives her hi-five]. Nice work!
I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
No, I really don't want to.
No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this.
Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna���
Mmm-hmm.
[naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?
Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
What?
Great.
Hey.
[Car horn honking] Oh, Roy.
Is that Mose?
[on phone]: Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ...
Nope, it's because it's genitalia.
Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred.
I'll try both.
Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?
Come on, Michael says we should go now.
Hey, can't really talk now, what's up?
Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?
That is weird.
Anna Maria's.
Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
Yep, it's English, it's 'impossible.'
Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry.
Well, I think she has a kid.
Wow. [heads toward the conference room]
A...hot chocolate tea
Well, he'll be here really soon, Kev.
Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
And as you know, I was a paper salesman. [whispers to Darryl] Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked. [group overhears and chuckles]
Oh, my God
In this car?
She knew it.
Seriously?
Yes.
Hey, grandma's back.
Okay.
We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man.
Yeah?
Oh.  Two kisses.
Okay. Let's start with the 'I love you' level.
So, this hot chocolate thing.
How did those get out? I'm sorry.
Right?
Barely, I... I don't have all the facts.  Frank and Bean...
Okay.
I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD.
Oh, also, while you���re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.
No.
That would be great, thank you.
If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --
Hey dude, you know what a 'rundown' is?
[in the stairwell on his phone] Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!
I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.
Nope. No.
Alright, let's conference room it up! [everyone is now in the conference room]  Here's the deal guys.  There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.
You look a little worried.
Look who���s back.
Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don���t listen to it at all because we���re at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so���
No. I just missed my wife.[Gives Pam a hug and a kiss]
That's an overreaction.
Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
Thank you for all of this. This is so helpful. You know what? One last question. Um, who is that fine older gentleman in the corner? [points to Creed]
No, don't push.  Pull.  Pull.
Have you ever seen 'em do that? [walk outside and the parking lot is covered with snowmen]
If you could help me out, that would be���
[attempting to move car seat] It's like The Hurt Locker!
I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it]
I'm not going to Utica right now.
Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.
You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
She wants it bad Michael.
That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.
[on phone] I'll take that down right now.
I need you to breathe in my face right now.
Wow, that is delicious.
I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here.
I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?
Andy... is having a
Right. Let's do some good.
Did that
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day.  So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna.  ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name.
Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.
Green walls.
[Dressed as Dwight] It's kind of blurry. [puts on his glasses] That's better. [exhales] Question.  What kind of bear is best?
It was.
I don't!
Mm-hmm?
[sings] Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,
I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.
Toby works here again.
Yeah, bigger actually.
Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?
Yes.
What did I write?
[enters room] All right. There he is.
[Michael has a 'sticky-hand' toy and snags a paper off Jim's desk and then laughs] About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.
All depends on the conference room meeting itself. [phone chimes] Uh, okay.
The last���
Okay.
Ah, let's do it. [laughs] Oh, that's healthy.
Look, you have a lot of strengths.
Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.
LOVE the hair. [Ryan walks up driveway with blonde dyed hair]
No, not without a 'please.'
Wait, slow down.
Dwight. Dwight.
What?
Oh, this looks promising.
No.
Mad?  How could I be mad?  We're having a little girl.
Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned.
Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend.
Nope. Not guilty.
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?
Ooh... fancy.
[whistling, places cup of coffee onto Dwight's desk] Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do.
Michael, that is hilarious.
You know what you should do? Take a vacation.
You used my move, didn't you?
Mm-hmm.  Okay, great.  Well, sorry.
Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.
Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-
Anybody could have walked in.
I'll take it.
Oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though.
Oh, uh, no. Could-
No, no, no, definitely, definitely.  Yes.  Next weekend, then.  All right!  I love you, too.
Hey, you got a second?
A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?
I'm probably never gonna see you again.
Oh wow, thank you.
Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.
Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  [cell phone rings; Dwight's voice saying 'Idiot, Idiot, Idiot'] Oh, that's my new 'Dwight' ring.
No, that wasn't fun.
Pam.
Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.
Good, right?  Hello.
Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know.
Thanks.
Hey.
You really don't have his phone number?
Is that really what you think?
You know what?  Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place.  Happy thoughts, Pam.  Happy thoughts.
Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...
Take care of my wife. I will be back.
No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it.
[speaking into the mallard and looking a Dwight] Hi buddy.
I'm trying Phyllis. You're Santa.
And you went to New York to do this.  So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?
You know, can I call you back?
Hey Dwight.
You know he's doing all this on purpose.
And a man.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.
So, the plan was seven minutes.  But we're calling an audible, because that's her call.  Because she's the quarterback.  I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
Okay! First of all, stop using my name.  And second of all-
Oh no?
What?
Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?
Come on.
[Michael is seen debating on whether to come back in to the office] Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?
[snickers at Pam's sketch] That is pretty cool.
He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.
What is it?
Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.
Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.
Hey.
Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.
You're gonna have to talk louder.
Yikes.
Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.
Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.
No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-
Okay, what's going on?
Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?
Michael went in there with him too.  It's pretty sweet.
Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.
Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here.
Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.
You will?  Wanna do it right now?
Oh, Dawson's Creek.
Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just...
Huh.
You really wanna bet?
Come on, Gabe, you can���t handle his hamstrings. You���re getting hypno-thigh-zed.
Well, your office is behind you.
What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.
Pam.
Maybe put up some shelves.
Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.
Yes. Right now? Yes.
I don���t even know where the stairs are!
In the fridge.
They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now. [crumples up beans, stomps on them, and throws them in a box]
Hey Helen. Is everything ok?
Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding.
Ok.
Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.
Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.
Oh...
Is that Michael?
You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it���s just gonna make you cry?
I don't... I don't think so.
Hey.
Next stop: Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also.
An Altima or better.
Did I? I don't...
Yep.
Hey!
[gives Dwight a thumbs-up - mouths the word] Good.
[demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.
I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow���s his wedding day. You can���t be anything but happy on your wedding day.
How do you feel?
[on the phone] OK.
Alright.
No.
That���s obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
That might be a little difficult with the one computer.
It's not.  It's different.  But it's a good book.
Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right.
I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?
Why don't we just go by ourselves?
Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1:15.
No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.
Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
I tried. He will not listen.
Stay in bed!
And then compare.
Yep.
No you don't.
I won't.  But, you will wash and buff our car.
Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
That's it.
Pam, Pam, it's time.  Let's go to the hospital.
Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs]
Striker!
I'm gonna write you up for not working.
Alright! Nice job, Oscar!
Oh you did?
My God!
And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back.
Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer.
Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.
Yeah.
Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.
Let's do it, shoot it.
Oh! Hire a magician.
It stopped.
[laughs] Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or...
I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
All right. Take care.
Pink is the red-
Dwight, please.
I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.
The one I have. I'll use the one I have.
Oh, wow. So cute.
Excuse me?
A wooden duck?
We can custom make them.
This is way more than I make now.
Bye.
I think I left my wallet in your house.
Okay, just talk.
Let's give it a shot.
Copy that.
No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.
You sure?
Hey.
Okay.
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
I will. I will.
I doubt that they're sh-
What is Yankee Swap?
Alright.
Hey!
I wouldn���t be too sure about that. Just saying.
Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?
Jimbo!
I absolutely don't understand, either.
Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.
Not much.
Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can���t give 100% to two things at once you know.
Which one... is she?
Oh, I didn't know you knew her?
Oh... Good.
Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally.
He did pick a good one.
You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine.
[answering phone] Jim Halpert.
I'm just killing Germans, any way I can.
Well, you're... in... prison, but, mmhmm.
Really, what kind of celebrity?
Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?
My god, I���m so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.
I'm just kidding. She told me about it.
117 Mount Bergin St.
Yup.
To waiting.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.
Bring me players.
Oh. Any team sports?
No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You're way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.
Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better.  I only slack off when things are good.
The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.
[after tense pause] OK. Here ya go. [roughly hands Darryl his thermos]
Why are you telling us this?
You okay, man?
We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It���s like everything I did, he just wouldn���t go for it.
Yup.
All right. [smiles]
I don't know. [looks at Stanley, who took his mug and is drinking out of it] Oh! That's... not... yours.
If I didn���t do certain things without telling Pam, she���d be married to Roy. [chuckles]
Yeah? [to Darryl] You ready?
I outran it.
Ah, coupon for a free sandwich.
Yeah.
Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?
[whispering] Would you please stop that?
Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.
I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in.
And in this case...
Yes! We do. [opens box] Eclairs.
...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
Alright. [they stand up] Excuse me.[They sit down] I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal...
Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard.
Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?
Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
Sales form for you to sign.
Umm... sure.
This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.
No one wants to be you, Dwight.
We were... I think she was just trying to-
It's a killer new dance move. [re-enacts leaning back] Do you wanna talk in your office?
Okay.
Not now, Toby, my God!
But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
Oh my God!  Wait, this goes back two years.
Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think...
[to Dwight] What are you standing for?
Okay.
No, no, no, Stanley.
Yep.
Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything.
And that's why it's on my desk, Phyllis; it means a lot to me, and now that I know it was from you, it means even more.  Moving on!  Uh, ok, so that's the end of the tour for now, and if you liked it please tell your friends: 'Whenever you're in Scranton, visit Casa de la Halpert'.
Um. He sticks to his guns.
There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!
Oh, you guys doing a little construction?
The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
I���m doing this just for me? Is that what I���m doing? I���m doing it just for me. If that���s what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?
Well, that is... because you didn't realize that... I was left-handed.
This one taken? No. Good.
Office romances. Um... [laughs] I think you should probably ask Pam 'cause she's in an office romance, technically.
No.
How are you?
Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift]
Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --
No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?
[sings Olympic theme song] This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.
Hey.
You're right, we didn't dance.  It was more like, swaying.  But still romantic.
What's up, buddy?
Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
Oh my God...
Well, he's Florida's problem now.
Um, this one interesting the power comes from the font in this one. 'Schrute Space,' very medieval, very England. Um, this one's forceful, this one's very Dwight. 'Quiet! Dwight Schrute Working,' it's good.
And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--
OK...
Sure. Look at you!
Oh, thanks.
You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.
I know. That's awesome, man. That's great.
Touche?
Hey it's me. So uh, don't worry. Everything's ok.
Yikes.
It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-
Yeah?
You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?
That'd be great.
Tony the tiger.  You don't hear that much any more.
You just came up with that.
It is totally insane.
Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.
I closed it!
Um, not neccessari...
Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that.
Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.
Who goes to business school?
Oh, yeah.
Let's take a look. Nice.
What's up?
[looks around room nervously]
[as Pam screams]  Doing great, push again.
Yes. You don't love Holly.
Dwight!
Wrong, for so many reasons.
I don't know, I don't know.
Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
Well, if Pam says she won���t go, then���[chuckles] we���re gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph.
Was that it? No, that wasn't bad.
Mmhmm.
Sure.
Oh, tell him I say hi.
Oh, my God. Are you serious?
Uhhh.  Can't.
Andy.
It was-
Yes. All right. Great. [leaves]
Yes! [as other costumed actors come in and join Andy in song]
Oh, nice. Did you check that list?
[silently counting] Three, two, one... [Erin turns on the office lights, all laugh loudly]
Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?
Unforgivable.
[on phone] Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a...
Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.
No, they don't.
Animation? All her by the way. [points at Pam]
Nice.
I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
[mutters] I know, I do.
That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?
Eight months?
That's-- [ding] the password. We're in.
Uh...
We could put that in orange juice.
Really.
Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now.  Totally.
Hey guys let���s just all admit it. Ok? Dwight���s better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he���s never, ever going to go back on it right?
Hey, hey. Okay.
That���s funny.  Ok.
Got it.  They're like the penguins of the airplane family.
Yes!  I think we should look into that.  If you could just speak up louder...
Ok, this is crazy.
I'm sorry, wait, so is the question 'How'd I get to be so awesome?' [laughs] Because, I don't have an answer for you. [laughs]
Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
Okay, Dwight��� Dwight��� Dwight, Dwight Dwight!��� uh���
And we don't know how.
Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--
Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss.
[to Pam on floor] Nice effort.
Did you just trademark that...
Couple of times.
Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.
[reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters.
[Michael steals the ball] Yeah, Michael. Go Michael. [makes shot]
You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?
[to Eric] You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause. [group agrees, protests]
Great. [Jim and Pam walk away]
Dwight, I uh, I have something to confess.
Not that I know of.
[office phone rings at Jim's desk] This is Dwight.
Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?
I'm sorry.  She scares me. [walks away, Pam keeps eating]
Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?
Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.
How much did you pay for it?
Gravel company?
[tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no.
[coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks.
Yep. Cool, man.
Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.
Done.
You're doin' great, buddy!
Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, 'I don't own an Ebay store,' so...
So?
I bet.
[to Pam] ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good.
Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.
I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.
No, no, you saw through me, great.
No, not at all.
Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work.
Yes.
Do you mean vibrate?
Ding dong.
Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--
What are we doing?
I can't.
Are you kidding me?
Yeah, I gotta call out on that.
I don't know, what?
Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
I���m on the phone. I���m on the phone.
You just had a rebound.
I love their sandwiches too.
[whispering] Here he comes, shhh...
I don���t know. I���ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
I dunno, it's on
And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.
Are you serious?  Pam.
It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.'
MmmHmm...
Cheer up. We made a sale.
Wow. Oh!
Prove it.
Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.
Hey David.
No thanks.
How much time do I have?
Really? Wow... that's bad.
I know.
Really?
Hypothetically. Hypothetically you were making out in the woods.
Really?
I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.
Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...
To the shame room! [raises bottle]
Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office]
But there is a reason why I'm here!
Pam.
It would look bad.  Sorry.
Uhhh, the street?
I think she wasn't wearing a card.
Alright.
[imitating game announcer] You win. [Darryl throws empty can on floor] How good did that feel?
[using black voice] Good afternoon! [Darryl smacks his arm]
Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column.
[to Pam] Really?
Is that your office?
Gotcha.
Good one.
Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in��� March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so��� [sits on floor]
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Okay.
And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.
Morning!
Hum.
We're gonna stay.
I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out. [closes door]
Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
Hey, who'd you end up hiring?
All you're gonna need to [faking a bad connection] and-  it- and then go to--
I���m not wearing eyeliner.
Hmm...
Well... that's not gonna hold up in court.
Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who���s gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.
[shakes Michael's hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them]
Absolutely correct.
Thank you.
[crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
Not really. I've seen a bathroom before.
Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it.  We'll figure it out.  We'll be okay.
Come on man, just give it a couple days.  I think you'll be all right.
Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?
And that's not the same.
Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?
So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.
Chapter seven: The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.
Well, Dwight's a purple belt, so...
That���s so great!
You know what, just in case she's looking you should put some stuff in it.
[interrupting] Volunteer duty.
No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What���s up?
Wow. It���s the end of an era.
You can't lay down.
Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?
Okay, I can't find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found 'em.  They're here.
Okay, you know what, Dwight. What if you got a really serious disease like Ebola.
I don't think that's gonna...
Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Oh.
Okay.
[everyone shouting at once] Michael! Michael!
[Holds up Hooters t-shirt] Just you know politics, literature.
No, No, we'll just board that up.  It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.
Not even an exclamation point?
You got it.
Good game Meredith.
Smart.
Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
Bye.
[Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.
Is that off again?
So this is my life.  Until I win the lottery [laughs].  Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
No...
Well done.
That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
And you didn't fail those things either.
Cute, sure, yeah.
Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands]
OK.  You know what?  Here we go. [stands up] Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged.
What is that, like... five pounds?
Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.
You knew it.
Let's... eh... see ya.
Oh, okay.
Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.
This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I'm not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley's tie is really the story of the day...
Oh yeah-
Hey.
Ahem. This is for you... and [puts blanket around her shoulders] ...Happy Birthday, Kel.
I know.  I suck.
[Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.
Thanks for the head's up, Kev.
... Yes.
No, that is what I mean.
[laughing]  Um, you know what?  I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell.
That sounds awesome.
You���re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
[In Kitchen] We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.
Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird.
Well, A for effort right?
See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.  It's-
I know, I know.
No, that was his wife, so he's on his way.
Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.
No, Michael.  I'm not leaving the car.
Yeah?
No I didn't.
Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?
cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
Hey, man.
Right.
[starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ...[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
Oh yeah?
So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.
What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?
Dragging sticks.
Wait a minute, what is this?
Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input���
You���re not serious, are you? You didn���t get any of the recital?
I knew it, I knew it.
Wow.
Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in 'Shagadelic, baby,' at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.
Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. [To Pam] Hey! How are you?
Ok.
Oh, thanks man. Appreciate that.
Show him how to use it.
What power?
Okay, okay...
Right there! [points to Cathy]
That was really good, Darryl.
You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
Is that him?
-I'm just gonna watch.
What?
Not much what's up with you?
I love you.
OK, I'll call the
Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple���s counseling.
Phillies fan, though, right?
Good!
What award would you like to give Dwight?
[ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what?
Oh, I-
Whoo.
Hmmm, I'd say 1 in 6.
I know. We're pretty excited, too.
Love.
Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.
So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight
Okay. You don���t need my help?
That I thought we were millionaires.
Who's gonna see us?
Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?
Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her.
No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...
Hey, come on.  Let's go to the hospital.
So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.
Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago.
[sarcastically] Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started. [starts to write on a piece of paper]
Andy? You all set?
Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?
Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I'll... I'll finish explaining the rules. Let's... let me explain it first, and then...
Not at all, can we go?
Thank you. You know what, screw this! [pulls Pam into a big smooch]
No, I'm serious. There's always something better.
[holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound]
Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.
Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?
Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.
There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
[to Pam] Wait for it.
She does not like him.
Right. It's city and country combined.
OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.
Uncanny.
Aww, nuts. [laughs]
I have no idea where we���re gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.
Who will be watching the children?
No. [Michael gets up and walks into his office]
I don't know though. I mean, you know that was a hit.
And!
Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!
Great, thanks.
[interrupting] That Pam's pregnant.
Okay. I���m really sorry I told the guys I���d be there for the board meeting.
Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.
Wait, should I have left the car running? [both laugh]
Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, ' You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.'
Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage...
Story's kinda bland.  It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
Wait, there's not gonna be a shotgun?
Phyllis says the same twelve clich��s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.
OK, I don���t have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
You what?
Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!
Not important.  Because you're not dating her.  Because it's a felony.
Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?
Well it���s not that easy. It���s kind of sometimes difficult.
Nah, I think it's mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.
Well, I tried. [Michael laughs]
I'm not talking to you.
15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?
I'm really sorry. I can't do it.
[over phone] What?
Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. [Windows reboot sound] Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?
Definitely not. That's disgusting.
That's not what that is.
Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...
Did you ever see that movie?
So beautiful. [Pam's starts to cry.  Jim pulls up chair to sit next to her] Hey--
Hey, thanks a lot.
Why?
[ahem] You can... [slightly effeminate] You can do it Ryan.
Oh, yikes.
Wait a minute.
No way.
Three, two, one! [pulls sheet to reveal Christmas tree]
Yes, it is.
The future mother of my children.
Awww, sorry. Did it break?
OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-
Yeah.
All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, that���s-- that���s decorative.
Take it easy.
Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.
Yes.
Thank you, sir. [Tips his glass to Daryl]
I've spent so much of my life telling myself 'Please, don't end up like Stanley,' and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes.
Right.
Killer nanorobots?
[pops back into Jo's doorway] Thanks again by the way.
Look at that.  Bob ordered hot food.
Michael, this is a conference room meeting.
Is that... I didn't know that was your... okay, so we're in agreement, this is not ideal... situation.
Nope, go back to the script.
Cece���s ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I���ve been working with her on her move. It���s called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It���s kind of like this. It���s pretty cute, right?
Cool.
Mm... not really, no.
I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.
Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
Dave.
Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-
Is-
Oh, I actually talked to my wife and we���d really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor.
Yeah, people like me I guess.
I got it.  Alright.
Okay.
You are?
I don't think you had to.
Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time? [Abby nods]
I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.
Yeah.
Agoraphobic?
No, I didn't. [Michael laughs] You know why?
To madness.
Wish us luck!
I just���really wish there was something I could do. [looks off]
Okay. Do you want me to stay?
Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do ���opportunities.���
[unbelievingly] Okay...
It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird.
Come on Dwight. [sprays Dwight]
Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it.
Um, thank you, Ryan, uh, I don't know, I think I made the mistake one day of telling someone that I like penguins, and here we are.
Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?
Okay that's five.
Oh...
[Overlapping] When's the last time you upgraded your printer?
Here's the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because they're set up to do that kind of thing.
Um, sniper rifle?
It���s just a list of our names, split into two columns.
Four months.
Whoa! What was that all about.
And the final clue...
That's true.  That's right.  Yeah.
Oh, burn.  Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too. [they laugh]
Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
I'm driving?
You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager.
Yeah, I want to go home.
I disagree with.
About you two hitting it off.
I feel like a stranger in my own country.
What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing.
So you're not doing it.
Just...you good?
And that's noon. Exactly. [others groan]
A formal warning, seriously?
I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.
Perfect.
Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that.
So instead, you screwed me?
Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion.
Thank you.
You took the deal.
Dwight, question.
I drive a Saab station wagon.
Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually.
Your ex-wife?
Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
Is that what happened to you?
Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.
This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
Sorry it didn't work out. Hope you find what you're looking for.
Welcome back.
And how many would you like?
Stanley?
Okay, make a commercial.
I got it.
I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working.
Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?
No shotgun... 'cause that changes everything.
Mmmhmm.  Why don't you start by telling me what you got.
[driving, sighs, laughs] No. you know what? No. Because... I'm not that guy. And [laughs] we are not that couple. [turns around]
Are you... interested in her guy friends?
What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
Hey.
Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.
No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.
Alright, my turn.
Okay, good. Stay right here.
[on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.
Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...
I bet we would.
I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.
Who wants Phyllis as Santa? [most everyone raises their hand]
No.
I may have told some people that.  I'm nervous.  I'm about to get married.
You've got something on your nose.
I thought it was a workspace?
Uh, yeah, I guess.
Yeah. ��Thank you. Thank you.
My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with.'
Hey.
Nothing. Guys? Timer's still going? Er?
That was like, ten years ago.
Alright.
Hey, guys, has anybody seen the baby?
No, no, no, no.
Let's find out. [starts typing]
Fine.
Whoa, whoa.
Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.
How do you know it was me?
Oh, don't be that person.
Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.
Wow.
[answers phone] Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.
Tour, let's do the tour first.
[laughing] She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.
Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win.
So, not prison.
I'm coming.
Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?
Ok...
Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky.
What?
Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
Yeah, why did you?
Okay.
I really heard him on that. This one's interesting I'm not really sure what he meant by this. Um, 'Dwight Schrute Privates.' Tough to say.
Ahh. [puts his arm around Pam]
Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.
Uh...
That's nice.
I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.
It���s insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I���m stuck here trying to keep him on board.
So good.
Yes, they do.
Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question.
Dwight, come on. Don���t end on a bad note.
[after 'the kiss'] You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.
That is a mistake.
Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all.
Yeah.
Oh wow, these are nice.
That's cool.
OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.
Okay, that is a 'no' on the on the West Side Market.
Uh, I heard it.
Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.
Let's go.
Uh, hit and run.
Si.
Mmm-hmm.
Which we are.
[motions he is on the phone] Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. [comes over] Okay. [sees notebook with two lists of staff names] What is this?
Yeah, sold about forty thousand.
Alright, then I will catch you later��� What do we do now?
[Walks back into The Office] Yep, I did say that.
[mimicking Stanley] I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
[on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.
Well...
No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...
Mm-hmm.
Yep. [Michael hugs/tackles Jim]
Well, I mean he humped Michael.
Hey.
Oh.
Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.
Just tell her the real reason.
How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran.
[picks up phone] Jim Halpert.
You got it.
Dave.
Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey.
Uh...
Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...
Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--
Which Spice Girl?
Whoo!
[on phone] Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. [to office co-workers] Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out. [lowers voice] He said it should just be under an hour, so... [everyone groans] we did it.
Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?
Yeah, we'd never do that.
Pam.
All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.
Except pass that breathalyzer.
What a horrible, horrible movie that was.
You shouldn't be talking about that.
How so?
Yeah.
You could���ve just called that an alliance too, right?
Big day.
Mm-Kay, Well, it can't be zero, Kev.
Mmm-hmm.
All right.
Uh, yeah, ream.
[sighs] I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.
No, I'm sure you're right.
Don't. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator.
I'd hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70's theme party, or a 70's theme meeting, or a 70's theme convention...
Oh... my apartment's on fire
Stop. What?
Nope.
What does that mean?
Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.
I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.
Yeah.
Oh. You don't have to tell me this.
Oh, wow. That's cool.
Oh, come on, Pam.  I-
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
Okay.
You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.
Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?
I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.
I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That���s it. You look really, really good.
Mm-hm.
Yep...
Nothing much.  Let me ask you something.  It's actually little awkward.
What are you watching?
Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
Mmm...
[walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?
You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
Chapter 4 ��� One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?
Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
If it's the same thing, then why did you write 'workspace'?
You know I have to do this.
What's that?
I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
Michael.
A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?
So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
Mmm-hmm.
Um... yes.
The other volunteers.
Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second...
You know, it's weird.  It's practically a shot for shot remake.
Alright, there you go.
Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
Fine. Party pooper.
I am.
And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.
[Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah...
Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading 'Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!']
Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?
And you are not going to, either.
Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.
Can't believe no ones thought of that.
Dwight...
Go get 'em.
[Michael in his office playing music loudly, Jim walks in and turns the volume down, Michael trailing off on singing]  We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.
Hmm... Five.
I'll just leave that suit in your office then.
No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!
Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?
Look at that one though, he's smiling!
So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
Think you can let go?
I would like to lose 65 pounds.
He knows what he's doing.
Pam!
Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?
Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
Sounded good.
Oh, excuse me.  It's my... favorite part.
Toby and I used to sit together until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much.
Michael, watch the road!
You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.
Definitely not.
Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes.
Because my car broke down.
Alright, let me turn on some music.
Oh, I stand corrected.
[on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
Yeah, what do you think that's about?
Michael, you shouldn't have done that.
All right. Bye.
I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it.[Pam laughs] OK, good luck!
You hired him?
Why?
I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?
Alright.
Why would you do that?
Can't do that.
Okay, so we're good.
Yes, I... Do you want to...
Ew, the exact opposite, actually.
Hey Kelly. What's up?
How's it going, man?
It is going really great.
Yeah. Maybe we should both go.
Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore. [Dwight follows red cord through office past Phyllis' and Stanley's desks]
You heard that one.
Cryogenics. Beer me five.
Hi David.
Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.
Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
So, that's how it's gonna be.
Not a surprise.
Sounds good Andy.
And that's what I told him.
What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?
Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met...
Okay. See you guys.
Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to...
Oh-ho, I am in.
And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it.
Pam and I are good buddies.  I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.
All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-
Well we all want a good party, right?
All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
What?
No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!
Hey, Abby. I wanted to give you this for all your hard work today. Look. Michael signed it and everything. Official.
Me neither. Whew.
Yeah.
Really?
[Jim moves his head closer and Pam taps him gently in the face] Oh, ok.
You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.
Oh my God, you do have gonorrhea.
You should take up a musical instrument.
Oh, yeah
Really?
[whistles] That���s a lot of pros.
Dwight, you wrote that memo. Okay, it's not an official memo.
O...K.
Permission denied.
Are you serious? [starts typing on the computer and Andy begins to lean in toward the computer]
How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.
I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- [hears door, hides]
Have you ever seen a stripper before?
Yep, okay...
I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.
Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
Okay.
Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food.  In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food.
Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?
Oh.  Like nobody.
The next year he really stepped things up.
Nellie
Ok.
Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we? [Dwight's phone rings. He crawls into nook under Jim's Quad-Desk]
What's that?
Hmm, sounds risky.
Come on, man.
-Right.
[not watching Mose]  More spins.
That's inspired.
Thanks.
Don't think you need the corpse then.
Alright, love you.
[hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down]
[grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.
You are not going to believe this.
You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.
Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?
Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.
Hey Michael.
As a hostage.
In Philly, so, that doesn���t really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.
Yep. You're being replaced.
What?
Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
Because not everybody knows about the party.
Well...
They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.
No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?
Okay. But what is he more famous for?
Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]
We can go.
No she doesn't wa- She's not here.
I can't hear you.
What is that?
Improv sounds great.
Right.
You're definitely hoarding this by the way.
Michael, it's really not a competition.
Yes?
The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he���s gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it���s not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It���s strange.
...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.
Yeah.
Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.
I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.
Let's move on to the next.
[sounds of a car crash] What was that...
[walking to his car] Hey, it's me.  It is 5:03.
You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here?
Wow. Alright. Can���t wait to meet her.
Yeah.
What do you want?
I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.
Yes, he did.  You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.
Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.
Mmhmm.
Sure.  Let me just finish this turn.
Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because...
Absolutely not.
That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
We should just go. He's really uncomfortable.
Not his mom's car.
I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment,  is the only one who raises her hand]
Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?
Nobody.
What's that?
[Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]
I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video.  I knew we'd need a back-up plan.  The boat was actually Plan C.  The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago.  Pretty much the day I met her.
Ooh, easy. That's not it at all.
Oh, um... [A long silence.]
They do?  So, cars are flightless airplanes.
Yes, you do.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.
We���ll see. You are an assistant who���s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.
These are actually forks and knives from the break room.
So, you just couldn't take it anymore, huh?
Pull over, pull over!
No.
Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.
No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone.
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?
[Michael is wearing a wig that is very close to Jim's actual hair, and he is wearing fake earrings, and speaking in a punk-ish deep voice] I totally don't know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?
Because it's a surprise.
Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.
Right.
Maybe. Thanks.
By the way, man, this place is... beautiful.
[on the phone]I can have it to you by the beginning of next week.  Alright? Thanks very much. [hangs up] Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?
But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.
Who doesn't?
Really?
Porque es muy rapido.
Mind control.
OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.
No, I did that before, it added nothing.
Hey, Phyllis, Do you have any games that you play in the office?
What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!
Flooded.
Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
Yeah.
Why did I transfer to Stamford?  I think that's pretty obvious.  I got promoted!  And you can't beat that view... right?
Yeah, you don't?
Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
Don���t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.
Okay. [Pulls desks apart] Just gotta...
Hey!
So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-
Two for two, keep it up.
Ooh.
How's that gonna help you?
Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
But you're leaving...
You sure?
I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok?
Oscar?
Alright...  Hey, did you change?
Oh, God.
You'd slow me down.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this.
Maybe we should just wait and find out.
Okay, sorry, sorry.
Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
Uh-
Yeah. You have fun?
I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.
Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. [hangs up phone]
What kind of car does she drive?
This shouldn't happen at work.
Ah, show me how this works.
I'm not-
Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.
I can't believe how bad this looks.
It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about?
Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?
No way.
What? [looks in box] Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?
Hey.
Okay.
New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?
Hey, can you go to IM?
I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody.
Oh.
Is this allowed?
You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. [both laugh]
You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.
Come on.
Andrew.
Where do I want to go?
Your agenda-taking pleases him.
Thanks!
Yes. It is.
So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?
Didn't I?
Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.
Dwight, should she be our manager?
Nothing.
Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!
That's okay.
You got it.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Let's be honest, it's not totally my fault. [indicates Pam]  Shared responsibility.
When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. ��I just wanted... to go home. ��This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013. ��You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space.
[reading from computer] ���Side effects of EMF include: headaches...���
Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. [shows picture of Cici with devil doodles] Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?
Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?
Michael's birthday. It's pretty fun to watch, actually. He gets very excited, and then he eats a lot of cake. And then he runs around the office. Then he has a sugar crash in the afternoon. And then he falls asleep. And that's when we get our work done.
God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...
Fair question.
Ok.
Wait wait wait, who said that?
S'ok.
Yeah, who'd have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up; smiles]
Nope.  Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office]
No, sometimes its right.
Sorry. Man. [Pam hesitates and then leaves]
Right.
Thank you.
I was just trying to be unbiased.
And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
Oh...
Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now?
Dragging.
All right, good catch-up.
Okay, Michael!  Focus!
Yeah that's great. Great.
What?
Yeah!
Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.
That���s kind of an impossible question.
Yeah. Bye Pam.
No. Michael. Michael.
Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.
Doesn't matter.
Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly?
Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or...
Yeah.
What? What?
Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant.
Phyllis! ��Wow.
Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?
Stop.  That's disgusting.
Hey, how are you?
No.
Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.
[Jan enters the office, pushing a stroller] Jan.
Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.
Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.
No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.
Alright.
She's... high-maintenance.
[as Pam stares at him] I can feel you looking at me.
Shhh.
Hey, David. You got Jim here.
Captain Crunch.
Oh, Aunt Phyllis.
And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?
All right. Name.
Are you sure?
[grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second?
[presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]
What's up, Hef?
Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.
No, I hear what you���re saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?
Essential.
I really don't know how it happened, David.
Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.
Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? [points at self] This guy!
- two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.
Oh yeah?
Andy, are you all right?
Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
Actually, you didn't.
[shakes Michael's hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
Bye.
Yeah. I'm definitely going.
By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?
Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?
Scuse me?
Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?
Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.
Hey.
There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for.
Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands - including Pam]
Ok.
I think she's okay.
Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen.
God!
What is?
Absolutely.
Oh, you don't want to know.
Oh by the way how's your side project going?
Prank! [throws money from Dwight���s wallet on the floor]
What are you talking about?
[exhales loudly] Andy...
It is. Big time.
Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?
We gotta get someone else in there right now.
Okay.
Oh yeah? What's the first best?
Hey Karen.
What are you doing?  What, stop...
It���s a monkey.
You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]
Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?
Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...
Hi, David.
You know what?
How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
Are you sure you���re okay with me putting in this much money.
No way, a 280?
How was your meeting with Michael?
Hey.
[on phone] All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. [hangs up the phone and rubs his eyes] Whoo! [Erin jumps in the background]
You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.
So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.
Michael, not now.
Mmm-hmm.
Thanks, Charles.
No way.
I don't know.
Half hour.
Ok.
Wow. Are you that bored?
Done, right?
Let's do it.
Well I���ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn���t believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.
You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.
Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans!
Your department's just you, right?
Very cute. [holds out the phone]
Good Lord! [Photo of Cece on Jim's desktop] I can't believe I'm missing this.
No, it's not 'ugh.' It is... office camaraderie.
He envies you.
Are we in danger?
You buy a purse.
Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?
Okay, I will. [idiot voice]
Dwight!
Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.
Oh, [clearing throat, deeper voice] Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh...
Oh, really?
Ok. Good talk.
He's just mad that we're all having fun.
Well, this is William M. Buttlicker.
All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.
Okay, done.
[holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe.
...Absolutely you should.
Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.
Wow. And just out of curiosity, how much is it?
Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.
Yes.
Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you [in a more and more seductive voice] and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? [Kevin gets up to join the 'hot' team to their great joy] Does that end the debate?
Yeah, yeah. Exactly.
You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.
That's-
Hey, sorry everybody.
I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.
I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it���s good for the environment too.
I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.
Oh, no.
You know, it was one day.
Scones.
Yeah, I do. C'mon. [they hold hands and cross street]
Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her.  It'll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy.  Uh... June.  Summer.  So, that'll be nice.  And that's that.
That's all right.
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um��� I don���t know how to tell you this, but��� we have a little bit of a problem.
Gosh.
Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten...
Oh, no, absolutely.
Nothing.
Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these.
Nope. Different movie.
That is good. That's it. That's what it is.
Oh, I just mean if you, if you didn't lock the door, then we could be upstairs where it's warmer.
Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
I didn't forget them, they're right here.
OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' and everyone's just staring at her.
Yeah. [chuckles]
You define foment.
What do you mean?
OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?
OK. [Meredith leaves]
Oh.
I think we'll be okay.
Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer.
Dwight says 'Hi.'
That's it.
Space dust.
Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement.
Hey, you know what? I got you a cake.
Angela.  Nope.  The ashes.
Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today?
Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.
Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.
I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing.
All right.
I [drops out] at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please don't call again.
Yeah, no one can snap with their little finger.
[to Michael] Will you stop?
Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just...
Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... [Ryan walks in]
It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.
what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
Where we going?
Dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level. And he apparently has a girlfriend, so... I guess there really is someone for everybody.
Just--Just--Hey!
What was?
Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.
Good.
Okay, what?
Well, I promise you that has nothing to do with it.
Yes, absolutely.
I can't believe it was me.
We were robbed last night.
They���re terrible.
Hey man, good to see you.
Yes.
A costume?
No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--
Oh. Adorable, right? [opens kiddie bathroom, sees man on toilet] I walked in on someone in the bathroom.
Yeah. Big sale. Don���t worry about it though, I don���t really care about the points.  I would like a point receipt though���[on phone] Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald���can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. [gets up to give Erin his point receipt]
Alright.
No, I won't.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.
Oh boy...
[walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] 'Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.' [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!
At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it.  I'm told it started as a team building exercise.  Unfortunately I really suck at it.  We didn't play many video games in Scranton.  Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor.  And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus.
Still nothin'.
Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?
Is it?
Ok.
I don't want to go.
[in women's bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.
Hi.
Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday?
Hello? Hello?
Uh hmm, definitely.
Ok.
Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable.
That was a great idea.
Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.
What?
What are you reading?
That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?
Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like.
No I'm not drunk.  Are you drunk?
How old are you?
Ok.
I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap!
Hey! What the hell's goin' on?
Did you go to first base?
No, we don't.
Hey.
Interesting, what's that like?
Well that's great.  [shakes Ryan's hand] You're talking about your court ordered community service?
Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else.
Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor?  Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages?  That'd be great.
Hey, David.
Not really a question. [starts to laugh] Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk.
Nice. Smart.
Or a gong.
And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.
Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone]
Yes.
Tell me about the cologne. How much?
Hello?
Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor.
Oh.
Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too.
No, I....
Okay.
You know, I just think you should know that-
And what happens in this one?
Okay.  Sshh.  I know.  [hands the baby to Pam]
Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back.
So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.
Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.
That's also not true.
Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.
You know what? I could use a little help.
Yeah...
Hey it���s Jim Halpert.  I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight.  Because I���ve read a lot about this really great documentary.
Ok, you're on.
Nothing.
Yeah, totally you did.
Absolutely.
Aw, thanks, man.
I just want it to stop.
Nope, I got eel.
Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.
There it is.
Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it.
What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?
Howard Cline?
Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.
Six point five days. [winces as Kevin smacks him on the back]
Hey.
Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
About Julie?
Oh, I thought it was your mom.
I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.
Our fake winnings
[sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome.
Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.
OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?
It���s Ryan. ���I���m sorry. I lied. I���m not in the bathroom. I can���t do it. I need to see my mom. I���m going home.���
No.
What?
[turns radio down] What are you thinking?
Yeah.
Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the... [Jim bites his lip again and pounds on table]
Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.
Yes, nice. Good word association
Alright.
Just give me one second. I'm just gonna grab something to eat.
I think they're going to the conference finals.
Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?! [Kelly and Erin screaming as Dwight bashes their heads together, everyone attacking each other and yelling]
Dwight, it's not a factory at all. Do you have to do what you are doing? [Dwight is tapping each of the bobble heads on his desk and making them bobble]
[long pause and then he sighs and nods] Yes.
OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?
Alright.
���Gotta go! Darth Vader's launching a huge attack.���
No, Pam.
OK.
[on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big.
Michael, look I'll just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.
And, um...
Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay?
Jerry.
I���ve been in here for 20 seconds.
Six of one, really.
You cannot take the fall for him.
Hmm?
Ooh!
No.  Bob, no. No!
I liked you better when you were the temp.
[Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?
No he doesn't.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
No, he didn't. [Dwight mouthing 'yes, he did']
Um... why Kelly?
Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so...
Are you sure it doesn't hurt?
Yes?
Roy said that.
Whoa.
You, too.
Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]
That's the Christmas spirit.
Nope.
Sounds great.
[slinking out of the room] Alright, you are welcome.  I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.
You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening.
Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.
Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?
Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?
No, you're definitely the problem.
Kev, c'mon.
I know.
Do you even know what that means?
Oh it has losers.
What brings you to town?
Sorry about that.
You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, I'll just be in, you know. [closes door behind him to supply closet]
No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped.
Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.
Ow!
Okay.
[off camera] ...what?
Ok, say please.
Son, you have to talk louder.
Where'd I find what?
Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.
Oh
You called any headhunters?
Well, then I guess you���re ready for this. [gives her the Christmas card]
Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?
So weird.
Well, you're pushing the milk out, right?
How long have you been a man?
[holds up an ASCII image of Dwight]
Andy.
Gimme a break.
You're not, nope.  Nope.
I had plans to meet a friend tonight.  Which I had to cancel.  But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer.
[brings Michael into his office] So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
No, I didn���t notice anything.
Actually, I have the certification number right here.
Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal. [in voiceover] I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.
What?
Where... did you learn all of this?
Okay, what was this look? [Oscar does the look.]
Bye. ��[pause] Yep. See, you���ve still got to press ���End,��� Pam.
Dwight and I are both writing letters to our clients. I'm just sending a quick note to say how much I appreciate their business, and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation. It's just... different styles.
[Reading Pam's palm, while she has on extremely padded gloves] Wow, that is really interesting.
To what?
Alright. Why don't you just-
Hey man. [Dwight hugs Jim and leaves]
[laughs] I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um... [nods]
Oh boy.
Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger.
I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?
Good.
Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?
Today.  Now, maybe.  'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.
All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.
I think you should do it. That's great!
Oh... lets take the tour Pam.
Classic.
Yeah, uh, well.
You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.
Really?
So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?
Uh, uh, ok.
Yes.
I, ah...
What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!
We've been through this.
[on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.
Uh, no. Nope. Not really.
Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
Thank you very much. It was fun.
Really?
Take it easy.
She's never worn these glasses before.
We're going to Utica?
I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.
I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.
That was one time-
[approaches Roy back at the wedding] There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?
That doesn't make sense, couldn't be.
Oh, there it is. J1.
Nope. OK.
Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and we're basically there.
Just... quit stalling.
Stop, stop, stop.
Oh, oh yeah.
Gettin��� psyched up?
Then take a different way home, man!
No it's not.
Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman.
So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that���ll print out���Hey. Meet your new desk mate.
[to Pam] Hey.
-give him to me and... perfect.
Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?
Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?
Well, you were surprisingly restrained.
Good.
Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  We'll be fine.
Okay.
No.  Thank you.
It was --
And doctors.
Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?
OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.
Love it. Keep it goin.
And a shower.
All right. We'll see. [to camera] No.
Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses.  Uh, four dollars.  And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble.  And that's a grand total of... [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars.
You must be really proud.
I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?
Pam?
Really? Not Slytherin?
Yesss. And you're Abby, right?
[chuckles] He's so cute.
Oh yeah?
What?
What?
Let the games begin. [sings Olympic theme]
What? Yeah, right. As if.
There���s actually not a rule that says that.
Boy I---
I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.
Yes.
Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.
Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just��� we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.
In the women's bathroom, above the sink.
[whispering] Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
[Michael walks in] Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets.  Do you want to-
Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.
In well?
He���s got a bank vault. That���s a start.
Workspace.
Can you grow up?
I guess he can't get any girl he wants.
[turning around to Karen] Wait, are we playing teams?
Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three.
Uh, Kitchen.
Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.
Competent.
Good, how are you?
Yeah. Good to be back.
Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?
Done. Explain.
What was that?
Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that.
[on phone] I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
Well it���s sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
Stop.
You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
Sure.
You look great.
That's what she said.
[whispers] Let me get that for you.
Andy, it's the last day of the quarter. We've already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.
You watched it.
I mean, do you like it? You having fun? [Andy snorts, unsure how to answer] Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun���.and you did that.
I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope]
Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.
The empanada guy!
There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.
And... ta da.
Inappropriate.
Oscar, how are you on that side?
Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.
You got it.
[on phone] Please don't pick up, please don't pick up, please don't pick up.
Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.
That's fine.
Puerto Rico was awesome.
[on phone] Absolutely.  I couldn't be more sorry about this.
Will they still air 'Rudolph?'
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.
Okay.
Yeah, I didn't think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.
Hey.
...Okay I can't... help you... with that.
Are you serious?
Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
OH! [the 'yes she's hot team' claps]
Is that another motto?
[ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.
Blonde.
Did you really?
What?
Okay.
Really?
Angela, burger? Dog?  Havin' fun?
Okay, maybe we should talk specifics.
I understand that.
Absolutely not, I'm mad at you.
Right.
Here you go. [throws it over glass]
Go bag's in the car...  Keys, my keys, where's my keys?
[laughs] It���s called Ghostbusters.
Nurse!
That's okay. [Hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby] Oh, no, it's not. I'm sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?
Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.
Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.
All right.
I actually know a sex model.
It's fine.
Haaank. Is that you?
Oh, but you didn't.
Yikes.
Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
No, I told you I don���t like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.
Hey uh, Michael.  Don't jump on the bouncy castle.  You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured.
There���s a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.
Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.
I'll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!
No, was it good?
Michael's stupid scavenger hunt.
Hey.
You know, man, it's really you're call.
[changes channel during commercial, sports scores appear on screen.]
Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
No, it's, it's okay. Okay.
Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me.
You up for a game?
Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.
[trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.
Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?
Good-bye.
I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.
We gotta get him.
Katie Holmes.
[Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
Yeah?
God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.
No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.
You know what? Maybe they just ate.
Chapter 2 ��� Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.
Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?
Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
But he did, right?
Okay now really think hard about this one:  One year.
Ready?
Michael, no...
Kevin Costner.
Ohh...
Andy, come on.
Yeah...
Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.
Yeah, but I don't smoke.
Birthday.
I saw him two minutes ago.
Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.
That was slightly harsh, don't you think?
Okay.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.
Hi.
Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?
Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I���m not looking south, I���m not livin���.  That���s what I always say.
Stanley. Stanley.
Yes.
Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole 'Woody came to life' thing so quickly?
I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?
Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.
I did... say that.
I can imagine.
You know, at the end of the day, it���s really only two days. I mean, I���ll be back in the office. ��If you need me for an emergency, call me. ��I���ll be there...
Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?
Here we go...
The office.
Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. [Pam laughs]
What about a gift basket full of cash?
OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
: Uh, is that it?
[looks at a three dollar bill]
Well, that was quick.
No. Was that the hard way?
I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.
You have a toothbrush.
I promise you, you don���t have to do this for me.
You know what?  Maybe it's in the ceiling.
Got to be kidding me.
Oh, great.
But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.
Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything.  And mastered the violin.  Oop, and sold more paper.
What the hell's a rundown?
Hey.
It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?
No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.
You do?
Nope.
No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
Like a boyfriend?
Yup.
I found Dwight's wallet in the parking lot.
So let's have it at the hospital.
Or a high school girl. Let's go [mouths 'wow' to the camera].
All right. And cider.
I think it���s definitely��� Well, okay. Either way���
So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one.
They're probably worthless.
Which would be me.
Well, there's got to be an explanation.
You sure?
See?
OK.
[louder] ���Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!���
Well, I mean.
Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight...[motions to lobby]
Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday.  So, keep that goin'.
No, it's not, because you don't really work here.
I don't-
Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
The new guys called one.
You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
All right. You know what? ��Maybe we���ll just... We���ll go slow.
I don���t.
Alright. Let's get started.
Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.
All right. I think that went well.
I'm sorry? Pam.
Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.
[enters abruptly] Dwight.
Yeah.
Agreed.
Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.
Pam. Okay, now I've tried everything.
Oh yeah.  Wait 'til you get to know her better though.
���Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA��� Dash JH.
You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.
No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this!
Wow.  Never pegged you for a quitter.
I'm gonna introduce myself.
Um... let's see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king.
Ah, definitely blue.
That's amazing.
Well, it's what you wanted.
Sure!
So you like her?
Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs.
And to drink?
He has not stopped working for a second.  At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work.  It's exhausting, being this vigilant.  I'll probably have to go home early today.
Yeah, right.
I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?
A little bit. ... Worth it.
We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders.
And what's it's name?
Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! It's Phyllis!
Good eye - it's an oval.  [Andy compares his arm length to his side of the conference table] You're measuring the table.
Right... That's good.
Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing?
All right, I am connecting and ... you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this:  Go to applications--
Oh.
Will do. [hangs up] I'll stop calling.
Yeah.
What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in --
There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
Not cool. [Dwight still laughing]
[claps] All right.
Alright.
Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.
Why don't... Let's...
Great.  See you upstairs.
It's a real handsome duck.
You know what?  Let's go.  We got to go to the hospital.
Where'd you get that?
You want to just make a run for it?
No, let's let her rest.  I'm sure there's still twelve on each.
Pam, don't worry about it.
What's up, Meredith?
Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone.
Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.
So, really, you're just calling her?
Uh-huh, yeah.  I am.
Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous.
Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-
So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.
Nothing yet.
You know, try sending them another invoice.
I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me.
Yeah. All right. Bye. [Kevin sinks putt] All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?
Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk.
Okay.
Oh, hi.
Allergy to... the desk?
That's what I'm saying.
Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.
Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires.
Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...
Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn.
Good!  Fine!  I've got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee... [dialing phone]
Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on. [to everyone] Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. [to Katy] Desert Island. Five movies. Go.
Big day.
No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.
No, that was unbelievable.
You've been gone for a long time.
Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit...
But, what if?
What does that mean?
Assistant regional manager, yeah.
Don't.
Ok.
[pumps fist] ...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.
Michael.
What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life.
Alright.
Yeah, you don't have to, ummm.  Alright, yes, that's not gonna be awkward at all.
You know, that's probably not gonna last too long, you should go to a hospital and get a real cast.
The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding.
[interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?
Chapter 9 ��� The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.
The torches are lit.
That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.
Good!  What's goin' on here?
You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really...
Groundhog Day.
Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
Okay. [IM chiming] [laughing]
There it is. Alright.
What are you reading?
Really?
He plays piano?
Three times.
And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.
Ok.
But that would make more sense. [Pam sighs]
What���s going on?
Does it save time though? ���Cause we���ve been here for about an hour.
Everyone knew some of it.
What was this? [Makes face]
Absolutely not.
Thanks.
Who, Steve?
All right.
Thank you.
Does he ever.
Excellent. Go for it.
Yep.
OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.
Because you���re sitting?
Fraud.
Pam's sales are fine actually.
Darn it!
So, I guess I'll see you in [looks at watch] ten hours.
Wow.  Um, ok. [pops Dwight's orb with scissors]
Wait. Is this your place Dwight?
You gonna wish me luck?
I'm not talking to you.
You look great.
And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.
My charity is the Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's Department, because Dwight's a Volunteer Sheriff. So I thought this was a perfect opportunity to support/mock him.
Hey Pam! How are you?
Probably
Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
Oh, it���s the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela���s been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.
Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?
I'll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye.
Yep.
When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.
Stop. Dwight, stop.
That's actually a good idea.  We'll all take a brief intermission. [To Pam]  Hey, are you hungry?
Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.
Get up.
But what are you gonna do about that?
No. Looks good.
Hey, Dwight. It's Jim.
Okay, they're fine. They're adults.
Hey.
What?
Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott.
I don't want -
[exhales sharply]
[watching baseball game on TV] Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out.
Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again. [Pam rolls her eyes and walks away]
OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later. [hangs up]  That was a good story.
No, that's him.
You know what?  I'm just going to call a cab from here.
Oh, would you look at that.
Wow.
Who else we got?
[baby voice] Hi.
I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] 'Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.'
Oh, it's like naughty or nice.
And then you'll be saved.
Would you like to be our fourth?
I've had a Foreman grill for about six years, I've done about 85% of my cooking on it, but I've never burnt myself, probably because I don't use it as a pillow.
You all right?
No. We're not.
Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.
I was very drunk.
Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?
Go get 'em.
I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks?
Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...
What?
That���s why it���s so clean.
If anyone can do this, you can do this.
Aw, man.
She's wearing a onesie [holds out his cell phone, Oscar leans in but Kelly grabs his arm]
[In the parking lot, holding his side, walking to the taxi, Pam follows] Oh...what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. [To taxi driver] One second. Oh...
Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
Let's Go!
No.
Oh, but you mean other than embezzling?
We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's���I think she understands... what this is.
Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.
Oh yeah, I understood.
We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.
Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.
Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
It's still happening right now actually, so uh...
Who's that?
Are you kidding me?  We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
To both these bears.
That will inevitably lead to mocking. So...
Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.
Oh yeah, did he text us?
Is this a bad time to be doing this?
Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham! [mimes punch] Gotta go through me first.
Too much now.
I can always kind of win at roulette.
Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.
Did you murder someone?
Yes.
And a dart board.
I'm going home, and I'm taking my baby with me.
All right. ��Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues]
[Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Dwight, Dwight.
Okay.
[as Pam has another contraction]  Oh!  Oh, alright.  That's a good one.
Too loud.
Mmmkay...
Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?
All right, I'm taking off.
What?
I don���t know. He wasn���t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn���t hire his wife.
If you want to come back then, that'll be fine.
Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while.
1. Here we go! [turns on wipers]
Hi Katy, nice to meet you.
Dwight, let me see your coffee cup.
No, you chose yourself.
Hello?
That's not how that works.
Do you run the bed and breakfest?
[Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.
Thanks Michael.
Ready?  One, two, three...
Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? [pause] I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.
Let's start with... your mom.
Oh my God.
Okay. There���s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.
I uh, I have some ideas, actually...
Oh.
And no one cared.
Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.
Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.
How are things?
Michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative.  Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I've ever known.  Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before.
Yeah, me neither.
Oh.
Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten.  Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing.
Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, [starts snapping] you're a Jet all the way, right?
We���ll talk tomorrow?
Michael, don't.
I surrender.
All right.
No, no, no, no...
Hey!
No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
It won���t budge.
Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, let's go to the hospital.  Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.
I don't care.
A futon?
Thank you.
Oh, Andy.  You know what?  We don't have a
I think you mean The Sting.
I play.
No.  They're in the conference room.
Oh yeah, how long's this meeting going to last?  [Stanley mumbles, looking at his watch]
This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
Whoa.
Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!
I'm Jim. [Jim hi-fives Abby] Annnnd... let's sell some paper.
Whoa.
So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
Yeah.
How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
[to Cece] You want a giraffe?
Members of the office, hear ye.
Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.
Aw, it's gonna be the [softly] worst.
And I'm telling you, I don't.
No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith���s face.  And if that  makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.
Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
That's awesome.
Stop what?
No, uh-
Right. There, first...
Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys. [to Pam, under his breath] Can I have your sunglasses?
There they are.
So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word 'Philadelphia'?
One.
Anything else?
Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?
Hey, Andy.
Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-
I'm really excited to meet your Mom.
Smart. Good. [to Angela] Hey, Angela.
Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something?
You know what? Maybe we should talk.
You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if he's, see if he's back.
Nope, not doing that.
So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam.  Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
Well, at least I don't have cavities.
Tickets are 250 bucks.
I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing...
Okay.
Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
I'm gonna grab her, okay.
Ah, gotcha.  Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.
I didn't think you'd notice. [laughs nervously] Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him.
Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
Give the bottle to Michael [sprays Dwight]
���Robert, Hey!��� Exclamation point.
Don't..
Things are a little bit... different here in Stamford. [shrug] It's not bad.
No, no, no.
Are you serious?
Cool. Thanks. [puts his hat on Erin's head]
Michael. Michael.
Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. [starts walking away]
I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.
[whispers] That's a good point.
Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down.
All right. Now I think it's time for you to go.
Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.
What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
Phyllis and Robert.
I'll make it worth your while, I promise.
I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.
Me, too.
Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?
Okay.
I know!
Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...
Who was driving?
Pam gets a little down.  Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago.
You know what? Let me take Roy.
Here we go.
I was... mocking.
Five.
He does?
You're starting your own paper company?
Well, the grass is always greener.
Now how do you know how it works?
[checks sheet] Oh... Deshaun Williams.
Spot on.
Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.
Yeah?
None of this is time sensitive.
OK.
A really awesome baby.
That sounds terrible.
Andy!
You like it?
There's a table over here.
I got this. [taking Katy's bag from Michael]
You need to let him go.
Hey.
I���m very sorry.
No big deal.
The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says 'You wanted me' enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.
fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,
Yeah. Thank you.
[laughs] Told you.
Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you...
That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag...[looks up to ceiling where there is a red tape X over Dwight's chair] Oh my god.
Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...
Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong.
Pro-- no favoritism.
We're going to the hospital, Michael.
Thanks, Kev.  I'm good though.
Okay. Thought people read more books.
Really? 'cause... seems pretty narrow... and short.
[in unison] I do not think that is funny.
He's a grown man
Do it.
I mean, you were gonna do this without me?
Sure.
They weren���t really talking that much about money. They just said, We���re good with investing and then I...and I...
No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.
I think she'd be a really good salesperson.
No, I don't.
For what?
I deserved that.
I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?
Oh! That was really. [Dwight hits purse against table] This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.
Okay, will do.
Oh no, I didn't want to see you.  Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, I'd say it was equal.  So, good to see you...
[inspecting the hole in the wall] Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall.
Michael, come on!
I don't know. Let's break up.
Let���s hear it.
Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this���
Yeah, that... Yep, that feels about right.
Yeah.
Really? You just agreed to that?
Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.
Wow! Congratulations, that���s a really big step.
Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.
Hey, uh David.
Stop right there. I love it.
Got it.
Well, that's--
Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. [looks at camera] You know what, just come here.
No.
Hey.
No, we used to. Now we're friends.
Wow, that's a lot of keys.
Now you're just being hurtful.
Ah! [Harry walks in]
Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.
When do we want it?!
[On the phone] Right, oh let me just check the pricing list.  Hold on one second...
Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward.
Oh, don���t look at me cause I think you���re making a terrible choice.
Thanks. [both eat cake]
About ten minutes.
Because you���re sitting?
No.
[addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you.
We bonded. We got to- [Dwight starts dropping into the bus on top of Jim]
[singsong voice] Who wants a hot chocolate?
Pop-up?
I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] ...no.
Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos.
No.
Yes, I���m happy.
Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood.
Yep.  Yeah.  She's blind, is that a problem?
Oof. ���Infertility.���
Easy.
It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.
So, how was the resort?  Did you ski a lot?
[laughs]
You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing���none of these people are good enough.
Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didn't tell you that.
Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot.
So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.
That's okay, I'll do it.
No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.
Yeah?
Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head:  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.
That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, '100% post-consumer content.' What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second.
Michael, you don't have to do this.
She's, um, she's in New York. She's at an art school.
Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more.
Six. You?
Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.
[walks into his office and sees the mallard back on his desk] Dwight, you brought the mallard back.
That's good. You know, with the kid.
Thanks a lot guys, Good job.
Who else is he mean to?
[picks a card] It's the four of hearts.
Hey.
Uh... [looks at Pam]
Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
And I took it right back. It was like...
I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!
All right? I���m gonna wait.
Dammit Dwight!
Nope. No dog video.
Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.
First of all, hi.
Well, I work here now.
[on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.
Whoa. Who is this guy?
Okay, someone look it up.
Okay.
Yes, it is harassment and I'm going to be suing the winking face. I've hired the angry face as my lawyer and you will be hearing from him pretty soon.
I think I'm ready.
I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?
Okay.
Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children?
He's a volunteer.
Okay.
[blows a raspberry, Erin looks shocked, Kevin chuckles]
Nope.
Stop.
Oh, so that's it?
I am Bill Buttlicker.
Hey, Toby!
Ding dong.
No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!
Hey, are you kidding me?
Yeah.
Hello? [laughs] No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK. [punches button on phone]
Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!
Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
Okay, back to the old grind.
If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.
So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.
Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.
What's gay-dar?
No.
No one.
Sure.
In the box. [hits it straight into the floor]
[shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.
Let's go to the conference room.
We should take a look at those surveys.
I guess I will swallow my truth.
Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton.
All right.
I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.
Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I���m waiting.
Just one.
Oh.
[to Cathy] Sorry about that.
Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical.
Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
Ryan Howard. Ryan! [claps] Gold medal.
So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I'm saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn't he?
Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly.
Okay.
Have you asked her what she wants to do?
What happened to 'Do Not Mock'?
You paid for it?
Michael...
Do you need us for any of this?
Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?
[knocks on door] Hi.
Left.
Right.
I've always gotten along well with Toby.  Uh, we're friends.  But I don't think we'll stay in touch necessarily.  I think I'll probably get updates on him from Pam.
There's a little more to it.
Is that really how you want to get this job?
The temp?
Hey.
What?
If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.
[after Darryl eyes him drinking from a thermos] It's mine. Don't worry.
So this is fun.
Yup. That's exactly what we did.
You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.
[Windows reboot sound] Mint Dwight?
What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?
Yeah.  Sure.
Because you said 'do you wanna hang out'-
I���ll take five.
And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
The mall?
No, I don't.
You gotta be kidding me.
No way. I think she likes this stuff.
So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning.
Yup.  Really great.  When's she available?
What?
Ah.  That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them.
You feel good?
I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
Oh, hey, man. [Daryl walks over to Jim, angrily and stares at Jim] Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview.
Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.]
My name is Jim Halpert and I am a sales rep, which is a very important job. Um, without me dozens literally dozens of small businesses would go paperless.  They would have to write on their hands, or bed sheets, or who knows you know. Total chaos, total chaos. I mean or they could get their paper somewhere else. Staples maybe. I don't know.
I mean... [speechless]
[sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.
At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.
Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?
Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.
Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?
You need to stop talking.
Is there a limit?
Just take the parrot.
Do Snowboarders hate animals?
Dwight-
I didn't say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.
Which one was it?
There is no inner circle.  Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.
Yeah.
Nope.
[reading text] Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.
Karen and I are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time. I don't know what to tell you. Right now? Dead heat.
That's a great idea.
Frisbee-based competitions...
No.
It was there when I sat down.
Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. [Reveal Jim behind Quad-Desk] Thank you.
Not even a thought!  It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!
Well guys with girlfriends don't.
What, seriously? What is she saying?
No.
What?  I did not do that.  That sounds disgusting.
No. I would've said no.
Oh, man. You remember that, huh?
Yeah, I guess.
Talk to me.
Yeah.
I thought we had that looked at.
I really think we should join forces on this one.
[Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.
No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'.
I missed you. [they embrace and kiss as Andy watches on sadly]
That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot.
Jonas Salk.
Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.
Uh-huh.
I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn���t know. Um��� actually I did tell Pam and we decided ���no���. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I���m thinking there���s another conversation coming. And, it���s hard to know when that will be.
Yeah.
Okay.
I... Why would you just say something like that?
Oh!
Okay, I'll just go get the other guy.
Again.
Nice try, this is ridiculous.
You mean your thoughts and feelings?
Nope.
[to camera] Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?
Ow.
You're writing something?
No, I'm not calling Karen.
Hi.
No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
Okay, Andy, we need to go. Seriously.
Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just...
Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.
Is that not what happens when you're high?
Leave the telescope.
Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
Quick question - do you play the guitar?
Wow.
Okay, DVDs. Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Toby, go ahead.
Yeah... .you want me to come in your office?  Oh.
Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I'm gonna need four. [kisses Pam]
Ow, What are you doing? [Jim fights back]
[to camera] Just��� so weird.
Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.
Anything would help.
Um, oh man, I don���t actually know.
You know what it���s not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
[on phone] They hate me, Pam.
Let's go.
Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
Can you figure out how to upload Cece���s dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.
[laughs] Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.
Okay, it���s not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.
So... how 'bout let's not?
Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?
All right.
I saw the movie. I just don't know every line from the film.
[Dials cell Phone] And this is Dunder-Mifflin.
The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that���s final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I���m not risking that again.
You want a birthday pie?
Who, Stacy?
Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.
So what is the problem?
Good to see you, too.
I think that's the question that you had...
Stanley, please, this is serious!
I can���t. I have the thing.
Come on. He'll listen to you.
Dwight, don't be gross.
So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?
[sits down next to Denise] So, high school.
Toby? Mm hmm. [looks back to Michael] I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...
Oh hey, Dwight.
Gross!
That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
You're an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-
Oh, yeah.
Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.
No, don't be.
Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.
Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
I am working on it.
Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.
Oh boy.
And I was still just a paper salesman.
I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.
Really.
Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
I think that's probably all we need to hear from...
Ugh.
She's not really my type.
Alright, thanks alot, David.
Oh, yeah.
So, it's not the dumbest idea.
Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away.
Stanley. Uhh��� you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
I'm going to take off actually.
I think you're under-thinking it.
What would Bob do?
So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.
Oh!
All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
OK.
What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
[hands David his papers] There you go.
A7557962.' Totally nonsense numbers, but you do what you have to do.
Sure, yeah. [laughs] Hollywood. [Ryan Howard pulls out 3 thick scripts] Alright.
Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...
Oh, yeah, so we���ll just do that later.
It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
Really?
Oh. Three nines.
You'd actually move to Scranton?
Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind.
Oh!
Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.
I have to.  Pam, if I'm not there, someone's going to go to jail.  Or die.
So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
Uh, Larissa Halpert.
You want music?
No. She wasn't.
It's not--- It's not about me.  I mean, this your dream.
Alright. [Andy rolls back]
Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see?
What happened?
Where are you going out tonight?
Courtside seats. Sixers.
The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.
No, really, what���s going on?
Yeah.  [Jim leans in for a kiss but Pam turns away]  She's fine.
Perfect. [misses]
Athleap.
Alright.
All right. Did he hit you?
Great.
Lay it on me.
Mm, can't do that.
Really?
I don't know.  Feel like... Friday night crowds...
Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
I... will... [gives up and walks away]
Ah, good. Good luck. Doing good. [goes to the index cards and writes another race down]
Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?
Me, too.
Okay. All right, come on. [picks up Cece from Pam, whispers to her] Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip.
Oh, great. So we���ll see somebody else���s kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it���s really not that hard to film a video.
Definitely Grandma.
Great.
Careful...  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
I think it'll take you a little longer than that.
It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming.  But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel.  I just can't grab onto him.  It's infuriating.
Oh, my god!
But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.
Hey New York, Happy Halloween!
[on phone] Hey!  You busy?
Nope.
No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or...
Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela.
Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
I missed you.
Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]
Okay, you could just show up late though.
You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.
Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.
That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
[raises hand] Are you stoned?
What?
Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or���
The big gun thing. [Dwight grabs at phone] Stop!
Try this. [takes Dwight's 'Asian' race and switches it with the one he wrote]
[reads] 'Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie.'
Trust me.
OK. All right.
That's all right.
We tried to find the fairest way to do it.
Thanks Janet.
Hey.  What's up?
[pointing to computer monitor] So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view. [picture of Dwight and Mose on a see-saw]
Okay.
See ya. Nice girl.
Mmm.
All right.
Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go. [hands her an envelope with money in it]
Ok, we didn't dance.  I was totally joking anyway.  I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance.  Right?
So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.
Hey.
And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
No one should be planking at all.
Yep.
Elaborate.
Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.
You have a walking buddy.
I thought it was a fun idea.
Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
What?
Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?
I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.
[in Darryl and Jim's Philly apartment] Hey.
I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife���
Can I get a drink?
Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?
Mmhmm, yeah.
Will do. [hangs up]  I'll stop calling.  [walks into lobby]
Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. [laughs] Oh, text message from my brother. 'Pam cool. Welcome to the family.'
Do ya?
Dwight, please.
Dwight!
Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.'
I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.
I'm pretty excited about today. I baby-sit Toby's daughter Sasha sometimes. So, she's the coolest kid. She has seen me play with dolls, though, so I don't know how cool she thinks I am.
Thank you.
Cathy, go.
All right.
We do.
[not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [sic] energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  [David laughs] So that's a... bonus.
That sounds lovely.
I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.
Oh my God, there
Doesn't it?
[looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled 'administrative' and 'assistant.'
Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.
It's getting late.
Hm hm.
Thank you, delegate from Iceland.
I will do some research.
Hey.
Not Night at the Roxbury.
Yeah! [to camera] Guten Prank number two.
And that isn't weird?
Just then, Agent Chang gets a bullet in the head.
Oh, great.
Hey, Kelly.
Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.
Ok, um, this is��� [leaves DVD with her]���I���ll be right back.
Lord, beer me strength.
[to Karen] Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. [Karen steps into lake] Yes!
Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?
Yes.
I did not do this.
It's going to be alright.
Wow, we're having a little girl.  Oh, man.
Oh my God!
Perfect.
Scared me.  How's the party planning going?
Nothing, just talking.
Okay.
Don't do it.
Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...
That's about it, yeah.
All right.
Michael?
Nice.
Hey, of course.
Yes.
[over phone] What?
No.
I don't think we have to do this again cause it's gonna take a whole. [everyone clinks glasses]
Really?  Power gel?
Yeah.
I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee.
[sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?
Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?
Merry Christmas Dwight.
See you.
