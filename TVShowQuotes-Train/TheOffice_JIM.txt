Okay, you know what, Dwight. What if you got a really serious disease like Ebola.
One more.  Why are you talking like that?
Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.
No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or...
Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam.
Closed. [Michael leaves his office, gives Jim two thumbs up, which Jim returns]
So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.
Hey. I was just about to call you.
I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?
I don���t know how else to tell you.
Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.
This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -
Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we don't need a new system though.  Happy with ours.
How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
[laughs] What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?
Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company.
Hey dude, you know what a 'rundown' is?
That might be a little difficult with the one computer.
When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?
Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.
Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.
Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs]
I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.
Sorry it didn't work out. Hope you find what you're looking for.
That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
[laughs] Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.
Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly.
Wow, what do you put our chances at?
I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?
Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who���s excited?
Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard.
I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.
[watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They've been in there for 45 minutes.
Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.
Well, we���re here. Perfect. ��[covers sleeping Phyllis with his jacket]
Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped.
Come on, Gabe, you can���t handle his hamstrings. You���re getting hypno-thigh-zed.
The big gun thing. [Dwight grabs at phone] Stop!
Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head:  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.
No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back.
I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be
Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like.
Well we are here now, so let's just--
OK, here we go... Digest of business terms, CliffsNotes on business economics, and a sales encyclopedia.
What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?
Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?
Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.
No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five]
There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.
Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine.  So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along.
Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.
Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.
Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.
You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...
Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.
Okay, you know what?  I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?
It is... more of a spicy brown, actually.
Ah, dinner.  Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.
Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?
No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey.
No, I won't.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.
He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?
[points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean?
[Pam storms out of the break room] Hey...
Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
[on phone] I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?
[under breath] Oh, no, not while I'm here.
Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone.
[to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
Hey. [Andy pushes things aside and sits on top of Jim���s desk, kicking things in the process.]
She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.
Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor?  Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages?  That'd be great.
Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--
Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?
I think they're going to the conference finals.
Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally]
OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.
I just���really wish there was something I could do. [looks off]
So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?
Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?
Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night.  So...
Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]
A7557962.' Totally nonsense numbers, but you do what you have to do.
All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... [to Dwight] what is this?
Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--
[time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?
You could���ve just called that an alliance too, right?
Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along.
Oh, great. [reads] 'Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy.' Oh that's not good.
Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.
[interrupting] Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right? [tosses black licorice into trash]
So what is going on, girl in the computer?
Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.
And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]
Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years.
Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.
Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--
[Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.
You know what?  Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place.  Happy thoughts, Pam.  Happy thoughts.
That's impossible. [Dwight climbs through ceiling hatch] Dwight!
No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular.
It���s pretty great, right? I mean, we���re coming along��� [to coworker] Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis���s timeline
[On the phone] Right, oh let me just check the pricing list.  Hold on one second...
What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? [Pam laughs] Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.
Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement.
Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift]
Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten.  Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing.
What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
[Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.
[at the Halpert residence as Cece twirls in the front yard, exiting front door] Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma���s got breakfast, OK? [to camera] We are going to Roy���s wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife���s ex-fianc�����s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it���s your wife���s ex-fianc��.
Hey man. I am so sorry about that.
I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.
Have you asked her what she wants to do?
Michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative.  Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I've ever known.  Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before.
The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was...[car alarm blaring] was in the...
Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly?
Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. [Pam laughs]
Yep.  No, I mean I really liked it.  I thought was uh, a fun read.
Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.
That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn't do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
Got it.  They're like the penguins of the airplane family.
I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.
I don't know about Stephen King, I mean...
I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.
[Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?
OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.
Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?
Good. I like it. You know what. Pretend to smoke. [Dwight pretends to smoke]
Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-
Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can...
This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left.
Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or...
Alright, let's conference room it up! [everyone is now in the conference room]  Here's the deal guys.  There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.
OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. [hangs up phone]
Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry.
[interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?
You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it���s just gonna make you cry?
No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.
[Overlapping] When's the last time you upgraded your printer?
I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.
Wait, should I have left the car running? [both laugh]
Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.
OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.
Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.
You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
You know what? I could use a little help.
Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?
Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
Mmm, that's where you're wrong.  I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require.  So, I think we should go get some.  Now, please.
No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.
That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?
So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
I'm not gonna- [cuts himself off, Kevin walks in]
Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food.  In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food.
What? What am I gonna do? I don���t ���
I think that's probably all we need to hear from...
Oh! That was really. [Dwight hits purse against table] This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.
I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.
Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.
I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I���m helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I���ve ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong.
I really think we should join forces on this one.
Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?
[after Darryl eyes him drinking from a thermos] It's mine. Don't worry.
Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
[on phone] Absolutely.  I couldn't be more sorry about this.
Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --
No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here?
Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...
Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.
Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it.  We'll figure it out.  We'll be okay.
Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.
Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this: umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. [reveals Dwight's purple belt]
It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out.  We're not going under.
So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.
Here's the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because they're set up to do that kind of thing.
Do you know the industry is in decline?
Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes���and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that���s���an amazing gift.
At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.
That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.
Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  I'll talk to them.
Why don't we head in your office to talk?
Oh, yeah, so we���ll just do that later.
Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?
[louder] ���Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!���
Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.
Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up.
Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
Get in the car? [Jim and Pam get in the back seat]
Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?
I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...
Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.
Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20.
Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.
Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry. [Pam looks at Jim] Sorry. I think I'm just hungry.
[hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down]
I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.
Bye. ��[pause] Yep. See, you���ve still got to press ���End,��� Pam.
Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good.
Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.
Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own
You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?
You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!
Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
I didn't think you'd notice. [laughs nervously] Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him.
No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!
Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
[Dressed as Dwight] It's kind of blurry. [puts on his glasses] That's better. [exhales] Question.  What kind of bear is best?
You���re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh���
Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?
All right. ��Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues]
Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.
What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.
What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?
Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.
Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
[chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.
Pam gets a little down.  Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago.
I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?
Is it me, or are we just a little off today?
Time. Space. Gender. [Dwight mouthing words] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] No, that���s --
Ah...[sees Dwight's wallet and open email] I'm gonna s- [see's Dwight watching from break room]
And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.
DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
[picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.
Now how do you know how it works?
I guess. [Pam smiles and walks away, then comes back and kisses Jim on the cheek] How dare you.
Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.
Ok, he didn't fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.
Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.
[Dwight hands Jim a piece of paper] Oh, what's this?
[both laugh] You know that I was doin' this.
[Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?
You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.
Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?
Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?
Because it is Halloween. So if you���re going to sing a concert, it���s a good idea to throw that one in.
[Walks back into The Office] Yep, I did say that.
Dwight, it's not a factory at all. Do you have to do what you are doing? [Dwight is tapping each of the bobble heads on his desk and making them bobble]
This is way more than I make now.
No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.
I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.
Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here.
19. [grunts] I had a really hard work out this morning.
Ok, so promise that you'll wait till we leave the parking lot before you go to the bar.
OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.
Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me
But it���s Dwight who���s bring in all the weirdos.
That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...
That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.
Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.
You know what, just in case she's looking you should put some stuff in it.
Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.
You did not force me to do this.
Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.
[as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.
Okay, you know what?  You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.
You could just be saying it to get the job.
I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
But what are you gonna do about that?
How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
Yeah, alright Kev why don���t you come with us?
Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. [Michael and Dwight enter] Guys?
Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot.
Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -
I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.
Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.
Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.  [someone dims the lights, signifying that it's game time]  Ok, see you next week.  Bye.  [to Karen] Again?
So I guess I can assume that was personal.
I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?
But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.
[Holds up Hooters t-shirt] Just you know politics, literature.
I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
Mad?  How could I be mad?  We're having a little girl.
I mean, you were gonna do this without me?
Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
Today's a big day.  Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  It's got shag carpets.  I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting]  She's gonna love it.  Right?
This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah.
[holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound]
Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. [starts walking away]
I [drops out] at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please don't call again.
I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video.  I knew we'd need a back-up plan.  The boat was actually Plan C.  The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago.  Pretty much the day I met her.
I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa.
Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.
Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.
Hypothetically. Hypothetically you were making out in the woods.
What the heck? Is that, uh... [bends down, cuts phone cords with scissors]
[In Kitchen] We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.
[outside] So I'm still in the process of converting the garage.  It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect [opens garage door] for an art studio.  [Pam looks around and then looks at him] Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---
[to Cece] Hi. [to everyone] All right. Travel safe, Angela.
Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
He plays guitar, he likes naval history. He's a bowler.
And say what?  'Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?'
Because you said 'do you wanna hang out'-
Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it.
Okay, that is a 'no' on the on the West Side Market.
There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.
Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion.
Are you sure you���re okay with me putting in this much money.
So, you just couldn't take it anymore, huh?
Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out. [closes door]
Cece���s really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.
Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
[Irish accent] Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us.  Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.
Oh, Andy.  You know what?  We don't have a
Oh, man, I���d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
[on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big.
Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking...
I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.
Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?
Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball.  Oh, how much?
Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.
How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.'
Yeah. [Shot shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse]
You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.
No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.
We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's���I think she understands... what this is.
Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!
You really think you can make it up to me with food?
No, I didn't. [Michael laughs] You know why?
I can't believe you guys.  I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again?
You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
Um... Whoa. [picks up ringing phone][in managerial voice] Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm  hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.
You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.
Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually.  But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers.
But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?
So, the plan was seven minutes.  But we're calling an audible, because that's her call.  Because she's the quarterback.  I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.
Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal.
fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,
No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard.
Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.
Hey, Phyllis, Do you have any games that you play in the office?
So this is my life.  Until I win the lottery [laughs].  Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it���s a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...
He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!
We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?
Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?
[ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.
Alright Pam, alright [gives her hi-five]. Nice work!
Why's it smell real? [Pam shows him a hidden car-freshener] Ah... good one.
How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?
[Dwight imitates the 'Jim face'] Look at that.
You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.
[turning around to Karen] Wait, are we playing teams?
Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
[motions he is on the phone] Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. [comes over] Okay. [sees notebook with two lists of staff names] What is this?
[motions for her to follow him] Come on.
New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door���
I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?
It's not even real yet. And I'm not gonna tell her 'til it's real.
That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom.
I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it]
No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.
No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this.
Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.
[enters breakroom] Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.
Good night, Dwight. [Jim leaves, Dwight continues crying]
Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?
No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.
Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on.
I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?
Andy, it's the last day of the quarter. We've already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.
And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name.
No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone.
Yeah. All right. Bye. [Kevin sinks putt] All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?
[seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. 'Soo-ven-yay.' Mr. 'Jacques Soo-ven-yay.' Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?
Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings]
Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...
That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...
[laughing]  Um, you know what?  I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell.
Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something.
So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.
Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.
Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.
���Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA��� Dash JH.
Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?
Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]
Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.
Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time? [Abby nods]
[trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
[in the stairwell on his phone] Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!
Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now?
That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
[waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?
God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...
[whispering to Pam in corner of room] So, they know.
You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?
Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work.
So I guess I'll just... work on my short game.
Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?
Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.
Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I���m not looking south, I���m not livin���.  That���s what I always say.
Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.
So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.
Angela, it���s Halloween. You have to sing ���Monster Mash���.
[starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn.  Four seconds.
I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.
Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.
Office romances. Um... [laughs] I think you should probably ask Pam 'cause she's in an office romance, technically.
What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in --
Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.
So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
[sighs] Hey David, how would you like a guy who���s not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?
Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.
Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children?
We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together.
Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.
Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.
[confused] What? [Darryl points at his thermos Jim has been using] Oh, man! I'm sorry about that.
Mmmhmm.  Why don't you start by telling me what you got.
No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think.
You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine.
I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening.
Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.
Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
Co-managing is a give and take.  You have to pick your battles.  One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them.  He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.
Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
Well, then why are you wasting everybody else's time interrogating them?
Well what if we can't do it quickly.
Darryl, it doesn���t matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.
Michael's birthday. It's pretty fun to watch, actually. He gets very excited, and then he eats a lot of cake. And then he runs around the office. Then he has a sugar crash in the afternoon. And then he falls asleep. And that's when we get our work done.
These are actually forks and knives from the break room.
I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.
You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good.
[laughs and swings his arm out which doesn't come close to touching the reception desk] I'm always this close.
[after Pam checks her cell phone] What's going on?
So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight
Dwight, I uh, I have something to confess.
Wow, we're having a little girl.  Oh, man.
Can I just talk to you for a second?
[goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait.
We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.
Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.
So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?
You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward.
Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.
If I didn���t do certain things without telling Pam, she���d be married to Roy. [chuckles]
I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.
Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.
Yes! [as other costumed actors come in and join Andy in song]
Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else.
Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?
Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?
Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.
Like hypothetically��� if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.
The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.
I love you.  Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!
No. I can't. It was like, hours ago.
Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?
Is Ryan gonna fire me?  I don't know.  I know that I've done everything I can, and I just brought in a huge sale, and... am I insane, or was this kid a temp two years ago?  Because in the three years that he's been here, I think all he's ever done is start a fire and grow a beard.  And it's not even a good beard.
Okay, you could just show up late though.
[talking on phone] You sound tired. Everything ok?
I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one.
[snickers at Pam's sketch] That is pretty cool.
Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, 'Mom, there's a ghost in my closet.' Now, you say one of two things - one, 'You're just having a bad dream,' or two, 'Let's go see what it was.'
If anyone can do this, you can do this.
There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.  And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.  Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay.  I believe she thinks she saw it.
No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back.
-I just don't know if I can do it.
Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on.
Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.
Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, it's totally hypothetical.
Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul.
[Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course
Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.
Oh, just somewhere in the Poconos. I was just surfing.
So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.
[on the phone] Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs...
I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.
[pops back into Jo's doorway] Thanks again by the way.
No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs]
what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.
[after a pause] That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.
Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.
No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.
[approaching Reception] Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?
I���m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You���ve got a regional manager.
A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?
[shakes Michael's hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them]
All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to.
No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!
I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
Yeah. Yeah. It���s a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to...
All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
[seeing Cece gone from the couch he left her] Uh, MeeMaw, where's Cece?
That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, '100% post-consumer content.' What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second.
I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.
OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.
Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.
Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
Doesn't matter what the name is. Se��or Loadenstein, that's stupid.
[dancing with Pam. They kiss] See, now you don���t owe me anything.
[tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no.
Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?
I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair.
So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I'm saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn't he?
So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-
I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody.
Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all.
[points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.
No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.
Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.
[to Karen] Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. [Karen steps into lake] Yes!
I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...
Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.
[laughs] Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or...
[changes channel during commercial, sports scores appear on screen.]
Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.
[on phone]: Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ...
I just got a text from Robert California that says ���bring your clubs to Florida���.
Alright. [Jim's phone rings] Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?
No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.
At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it.  I'm told it started as a team building exercise.  Unfortunately I really suck at it.  We didn't play many video games in Scranton.  Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor.  And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus.
Not gravel, obviously. [both chuckle] No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-
[after 'the kiss'] You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.
Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.
Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.
Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?
Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here...
You���re not serious, are you? You didn���t get any of the recital?
If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --
Oh, there's no game.  We're just trying to get these chips for Karen.
Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second...
Alright, here we go!  You're doing great!  She'll be here soon.
[Michael has a 'sticky-hand' toy and snags a paper off Jim's desk and then laughs] About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.
[long pause] Huh. This is a little out of left field.
A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?
What about a gift basket full of cash?
I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it���s good for the environment too.
Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.
[walks quickly to break room, opens cabinet and finds mugs of Oscar, Creed and Phyllis]
Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?
I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing...
I���ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I���d be proud to take.
But there's definitely a desk open in the back.
Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.
I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?
Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic.
You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if he's, see if he's back.
Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?
So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.
[pointing to computer monitor] So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view. [picture of Dwight and Mose on a see-saw]
[as Pam stares at him] I can feel you looking at me.
Here you go again! What is your deal today?
The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he���s gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it���s not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It���s strange.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone.
Don���t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.
It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.'
You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.
Come on man, just give it a couple days.  I think you'll be all right.
Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!
Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know.
You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks.
I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife���
And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.
And, also, any forms that you are going to need...
Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
[on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.
Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.
Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys. [to Pam, under his breath] Can I have your sunglasses?
I'll just leave that suit in your office then.
And that's why it's on my desk, Phyllis; it means a lot to me, and now that I know it was from you, it means even more.  Moving on!  Uh, ok, so that's the end of the tour for now, and if you liked it please tell your friends: 'Whenever you're in Scranton, visit Casa de la Halpert'.
Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.
Wasn't it...  It's kinda like a...  Like that.
I have to.  Pam, if I'm not there, someone's going to go to jail.  Or die.
[notices cleaning crew coming up to the gate] Cleaning people. Oscar. [everyone starts to walk outside] OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us.
Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding.
No, he didn't. [Dwight mouthing 'yes, he did']
He has not stopped working for a second.  At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work.  It's exhausting, being this vigilant.  I'll probably have to go home early today.
He's not a part of this. You know that.
Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses.  Uh, four dollars.  And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble.  And that's a grand total of... [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars.
Ah, well I think I'm gonna see Katy.
I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people.
Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.
It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. [Towards unseen cameraman] Is bold the right word?
Shut up, you, shut up!  This is the dumbest thing we've ever done.
[To Dwight] So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?
Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?
We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.
I promise you, we don���t need a warning-
Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think.
You know what?  Maybe it's in the ceiling.
[Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing, Jim imitates her] Can I do something for ya?
I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.
And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
[sits down next to Denise] So, high school.
OH, that's great. I'm really happy for [starts to walk away]
No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.
So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.
[overlapping with Pam] Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed.
If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, 'Well that's pretty premature to think,' but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.
Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert���s notebook.
You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.
Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica.
Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...
Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?
OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday.
Careful...  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.
...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.
I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.
Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?
I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.
[whispering, going into the bathroom with Cece] Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!
Yes!  I think we should look into that.  If you could just speak up louder...
Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...
I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.
It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about?
Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
Later, Kev. [Puts French Onion Potato Chips on Pam's desk] Have a good weekend.
No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.
Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.
Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?
No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.
Nope, not a prank. I think it���s time for you to bury the hatchet.
Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---
I'm Jim. [Jim hi-fives Abby] Annnnd... let's sell some paper.
Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.
[looks in  the refrigerator] Hey Dwight, my tuna sandwich isn't in the refrigerator. You wouldn't know anything about that would you?
Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but it's always buried behind like a ton of black licorice? [points to pile of candy] Bought it all. Now it's like red city in there. So, enjoy it.
No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.
Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- [texting on his phone]
Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, she's so beautiful!  Oh, my God.
I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day.  So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna.  ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name.
Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
What?  I did not do that.  That sounds disgusting.
[sounds of a car crash] What was that...
Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
Ow, What are you doing? [Jim fights back]
But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon.
If your client likes Italian food, you bring him to Cugino's.  And if your client likes a little action, you bring him a gambler.  And if your client hates Cornell, you bring him Andy.
Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. [shows picture of Cici with devil doodles] Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?
Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing]
Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!
Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here.
Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.
[Michael is wearing a wig that is very close to Jim's actual hair, and he is wearing fake earrings, and speaking in a punk-ish deep voice] I totally don't know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?
Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.
I didn't ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away]
Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?
[puts his phone in his coffee mug and calls Gabe]
Actually if I had fewer outside classes, I probably wouldn't be stuck here at a paper company.
[to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?
I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.
No, let's let her rest.  I'm sure there's still twelve on each.
[on the phone] Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great. [goes into a private room where Pam and the doctor are, the voices are inaudible, but the camera can see through a window, Pam and Jim look in shock, they hug and Jim goes back out into the hall to call Dwight back, trembling] Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs! [laughs] Ohh! [goes back into the room to hug Pam]
Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?
Oh by the way how's your side project going?
Um, like stapler tennis or something like that.
Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.
Alright.  I'll tell everybody here that you say hi.
Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
Not even a thought!  It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!
Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?
But you know I wouldn���t hire any of these all-stars.
No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair.
No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right.
Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out.
Okay, okay, it's no big deal.  So you're not a computer geek.
It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird.
Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?
[on phone] I'll take that down right now.
OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.
Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. I'm gonna find him.
What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?
[Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah...
Yeah, I'd say she's happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8:00 AM.
Wow, can we make it a different moment?
Chapter 4 ��� One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.
[gives Dwight a thumbs-up - mouths the word] Good.
And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.
Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.
No, I told you I don���t like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.
Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.
Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.
Jan didn't come back for her car last night.
Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.
Alright, I���m gonna go warm up the car.
Every time there's a silence, your brain's like 'Heh-heh-huh-huh' [imitating crying].
[flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?
That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.
Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.
Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
[nervous laughter] Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months...
I think she'd be a really good salesperson.
Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.
We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.
Are you kidding me?  We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can ..
[holds up the retrieved lead] It involves you too.
Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?
And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.
I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too.
When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.
Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.
I think that's the question that you had...
Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.
[approaches Roy back at the wedding] There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?
That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
I don���t know what to tell you, man.
[on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.
No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don't worry about it.
Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column.
We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?
I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
K, Kevin, are you saying ���See the world���? or ���Sea World?���
Well, Pam I'm not gonna lie to you, he's chances are none. Um, he's 41 years old, he is losing his hair and his cell phone ring is 'Mambo #5.' So...
[Jim slams lunchbag on table] I just totally blew a sales call.
Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... .
My name is Jim Halpert and I am a sales rep, which is a very important job. Um, without me dozens literally dozens of small businesses would go paperless.  They would have to write on their hands, or bed sheets, or who knows you know. Total chaos, total chaos. I mean or they could get their paper somewhere else. Staples maybe. I don't know.
Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just...
Are you not gonna put out the torches?
That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
[inspecting the hole in the wall] Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall.
I think I did a pretty good job.
No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
[getting up quickly to silence Michael] No, no. Nope.
OK, I don���t have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
You want to just make a run for it?
Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he���ll be calling in any second.
No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.
That's okay. [Hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby] Oh, no, it's not. I'm sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?
[to camera] Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.
He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.
[silently counting] Three, two, one... [Erin turns on the office lights, all laugh loudly]
I got this. [taking Katy's bag from Michael]
Are you serious? [starts typing on the computer and Andy begins to lean in toward the computer]
It's not.  It's different.  But it's a good book.
Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.
Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?
I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.
Come on, Michael says we should go now.
Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.
I don't know though. I mean, you know that was a hit.
Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. God, it's freezing, I gotta go in. You stay though for like five minutes.
What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...
OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.
So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.
Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so...
You know, it's weird.  It's practically a shot for shot remake.
Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.
Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.
The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says 'You wanted me' enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.
Oh, my God, thank you. [hugging both] Thank you.
Yeah, oh, I know. Looks great. [Dwight throws the purse over his right shoulder and gets back to work]
[on the phone]and I���m back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?
Will do. [hangs up]  I'll stop calling.  [walks into lobby]
Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
I'm just killing Germans, any way I can.
Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. [looks at camera] You know what, just come here.
Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.
I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.
Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work.
Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small-[pointing to Angela] Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!
Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.
Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don���t want to meet that person.
I really don't know how it happened, David.
Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn���t going to show up?
It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.
I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.
I don't know. [looks at Stanley, who took his mug and is drinking out of it] Oh! That's... not... yours.
Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?
The minister just told me that it���s tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually.
Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.
Well, I mean, I don���t even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so��� These things go down all the time.
I'm sorry, did we or did we not pay for a show?
Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.
Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this���
She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that���s fine.
It's true. I'm having a party.  I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up.  [sighs]  He is very real.
[on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]
Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God.
Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...
I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?
Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!
No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.
I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!
Oh yeah, how long's this meeting going to last?  [Stanley mumbles, looking at his watch]
I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
Oh, [clearing throat, deeper voice] Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh...
Okay, 'A,' Halbert. And, 'B,' I think a more appropriate statement would be, 'The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests.'
So, as it turns out, Dwight is right. How bizarre.
Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.
I'll make it worth your while, I promise.
Uh, what does -- what does that mean?
Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.
So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word 'Philadelphia'?
Don't. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator.
OK.  You know what?  Here we go. [stands up] Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged.
[on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.
Shuckin��� the peas. ��You should go back to the first part, though. You are ��gonna ��cover for me?
Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
She's wearing a onesie [holds out his cell phone, Oscar leans in but Kelly grabs his arm]
Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.
Uh��� [clears throat] Well, it���s about Athlead. I���m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?
[on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.
Does it save time though? ���Cause we���ve been here for about an hour.
I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.
LOVE the hair. [Ryan walks up driveway with blonde dyed hair]
I'm not writing, 'Horse Hunt.' I don't even know what that means.
Wow. [sees guy at Erin's desk] Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar.
My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this.
Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.
I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So...  I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--
I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.
Ah, let's do it. [laughs] Oh, that's healthy.
Let me guess, you think you should get it.
Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.
I had plans to meet a friend tonight.  Which I had to cancel.  But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer.
I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.
That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag...[looks up to ceiling where there is a red tape X over Dwight's chair] Oh my god.
Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? [pause] I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.
I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  He's winning.  I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.
That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right?
Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.
...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky.
I think today was a good day to have two managers.  'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing.  But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy.  It's because they're doing it for the kids.  And I get that now.
[coughs] Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one!
Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend.
I found Dwight's wallet in the parking lot.
Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of ���Pilot���]
That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.
Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right.
Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.
And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.
By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?
Oh wow.  So that���s two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
No he doesn't.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah.
[on phone] Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a...
All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.
No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?
No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this!
Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.
Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah.
Mose has been weird? That���s so unlike him.
Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.
[reads demerit] 'Jim Halpert, tardiness.' Ugh. I love it already.
[talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?
What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.
Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable.
You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine.
Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
We were... I think she was just trying to-
Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it.
I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!
Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?
Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or...
Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
[arm around Pam] Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.
[to Karen] Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole.
Pam's doing great.  Uh, she's ten inches dilated now.  Uh, sorry, meters.  Centimeters.  And she's also fully faced.  Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet.  It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.
I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here: Michael handles more of the 'big-picture' stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...
Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?
Right! [Jim laughs as he answers the phone] Hey, what's up? Everything ok?
Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep.
Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.
I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.
OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.
We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]
Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.
Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.
No way. I think she likes this stuff.
Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?
David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.
What was my worst first date?  Umm.  It was a couple of years ago.  It was a lunch date, actually, it was right down here, at Cugino's.  And we had just met, and we really hit it off, it was, it was kinda nice.  Umm, huh.  And, uh, then, as it turned out, it wasn't even a date, because she was actually in love with someone else.  So, best first date is also my worst first date.  Oddly enough.
In the box. [hits it straight into the floor]
Phyllis says the same twelve clich��s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.
Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.
I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.
There���s a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.
So, you used to share that cubicle with Kelly, right?
[using black voice] Good afternoon! [Darryl smacks his arm]
Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.
I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80's movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I don't do that, I think I'll be alright.
He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.
Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that���ll print out���Hey. Meet your new desk mate.
No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place.
No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith���s face.  And if that  makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.
[sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?
Yeah. You know what? I���ll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.
Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be...  Can we get a late checkout?  I don't...  I don't think she heard me.
[holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe.
[Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell?
Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but...
Oh, did the press ask for a story?
You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?
I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
Nothing much.  Let me ask you something.  It's actually little awkward.
Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her.  It'll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy.  Uh... June.  Summer.  So, that'll be nice.  And that's that.
Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I'm gonna need four. [kisses Pam]
Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?
Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?
[scoffs] I... will never say a word.  And now, we are even.
OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
All you're gonna need to [faking a bad connection] and-  it- and then go to--
This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.
Oh, come on, Pete! God, that���s just sad. If he doesn���t watch himself, he���s gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.
We gotta get someone else in there right now.
Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud.
I think I���m a little too busy these days to s--- [whispering] Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.
There.  Now we're even.  [Pam laughs and mimes taking a picture, they kiss]
Oh. You don't have to tell me this.
Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what the best play is. Do we tear everything up, or do we buy a horse on the Internet? I mean, I don't know what to do. What do you think?
You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.
You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
[whispering] I don't even know who you are anymore.
Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.
I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--
Oh Dwight, Dwight, [Dwight pukes on his back windshield]  Ohhhhhh!
How would that work in well?  I just want to know.
Yeah, woah. [deeper voice] Yep, absolutely, go ahead.
How do you hate it? It's a cake.
Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. [Andy hums Six Flag ad] Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?
Yeah. It���s real. It���s the only way you���ll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She���s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
Oh, don���t look at me cause I think you���re making a terrible choice.
I bet I should. [takes cell phone photo] That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you.
I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.
He's good at his job.  And I like working for him.
To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle.
No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done.
Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.
Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that it's Friday.  And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.
Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?
Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people.
OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me.
No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
[coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks.
Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips.
Oh, hey, man. [Daryl walks over to Jim, angrily and stares at Jim] Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview.
Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?
For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here...
Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.]
[to camera, holds up a bean] Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture [walking around the table] of who you think deserv-- who's that? [picture that Michael drew of toby, looks like a monster]
These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one.  [Michael stands on podium] Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal. [everyone claps]
So, I guess I'll see you in [looks at watch] ten hours.
Okay. There���s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.
Hey guys let���s just all admit it. Ok? Dwight���s better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he���s never, ever going to go back on it right?
Does the Department of Health know about this?
There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.
Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything.
Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.
You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.
No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--
This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that���s for fueling only. No savoring.
Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything.
Is that really how you want to get this job?
Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.
I think it���s definitely��� Well, okay. Either way���
I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.
You know what?  Let's go.  We got to go to the hospital.
Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
Wow.  I guess word got around.  That's a nice... honor.
I love Star Wars as much as the next guy���
No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What���s up?
Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we? [Dwight's phone rings. He crawls into nook under Jim's Quad-Desk]
Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
Yeah, we did. Hey, how long���how long do we think that���s gonna take?
Have you ever seen 'em do that? [walk outside and the parking lot is covered with snowmen]
No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar?
You know what?  Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition?  I'd love to see that dunk of yours.
[hovering over Meredith's desk] Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.
Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird.
OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...
Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I���m waiting.
Okay! First of all, stop using my name.  And second of all-
You are really good at modesty. She���s a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kids��� room. There���s a hippo leading a parade of 500 children���
Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.
Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
[on phone]  Hi, yeah.  This is Mike from the West Side Market.  Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah.  You have 'em in the warehouse.  Great.  What is my store number... six.  Wait, no.  I'll call you back. [quickly hangs up] Shut up [to Karen].
Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.
[on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.
Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today?
Okay.  That is me, but I didn't order the cake.
Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?
Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?
[long pause and then he sighs and nods] Yes.
Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.
But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.
I���m really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?
[he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!
No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!
Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away.
Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea.  Let's go out.
If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.
Toby and I used to sit together until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much.
You did not have sex with Pam's mom.
You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.
This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.
What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.
You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also? [Pam nods] Yes we will be doing that. We'll be getting a dozen.
I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?
Three, two, one! [pulls sheet to reveal Christmas tree]
Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.
[answers phone] Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.
Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we���re just starting couple���s counseling. Uh, which doesn���t sound any better.
With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number.
Michael went in there with him too.  It's pretty sweet.
Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.
Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.
And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?
Not enough? I don���t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it���s against the rules but I���m gonna need a favor from you guys.
Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
But if not, there's always the army. The infantry.
Oops, that���s my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal.  It's Lackawanna County.  Our whole county.  And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch.  And I could work here for years.  And years.  [groan] Years.
All right!  [sitting down behind Michael's desk] I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but...
Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.
Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
Slowly, slowly.  Let's just get to the elevator.
OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first.
Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.
We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.
Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?
[using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight]
Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to...
Sorry. I���no, no, no, what I meant���what I meant actually was���
No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?
Um... let's see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king.
Try this. [takes Dwight's 'Asian' race and switches it with the one he wrote]
Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?
Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.
Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. [To Pam] Hey! How are you?
[walks in, see's Oscar, Stanley, Creed and Kelly sitting in Michaels office] Okay, I thought I saw people missing.
I really don't know.  How you doing with all this?
[attempting to move car seat] It's like The Hurt Locker!
[Sighs] I'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes.
If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play?
Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that.
So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so...
How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didn't tell you that.
Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.
Those are like my favorite movies. I didn't really think you could win Desert Island, but I think you just did.
Well I���ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn���t believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.
Things are a little bit... different here in Stamford. [shrug] It's not bad.
Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?
[takes her hand] Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, you're so pretty.
I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything. [laughs]
I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
[explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it's a tradeoff.
Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?
Tony the tiger.  You don't hear that much any more.
I'd hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70's theme party, or a 70's theme meeting, or a 70's theme convention...
Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, ' You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.'
Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.
Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?
Right, cause that's what we are talking about.
The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational. I mean, he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year. Which is probably why this branch will be downsized.
No, it- [high-pitched feedback as Jim starts to leave, feedback changes as he moves, turns over the mallard to see the listening devics, sighs, places mallard back on the desk]
I wouldn���t be too sure about that. Just saying.
Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker.  And a great number two for the office.
Do you need us for any of this?
Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back.
Oh man, it was great. They were great.
Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.
You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. [both laugh]
No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'.
By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?
Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.
[Meredith's hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Is this a bad time to be doing this?
Uh, I think you dropped this [hands over piece of paper]
Well it's just that you had no hair on Friday.
No, that was his wife, so he's on his way.
I just don't know if he's presidential enough.
I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.
Oh.  Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.
Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We're going to the hospital now.
If you want to come back then, that'll be fine.
Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?
[Christian Slater impression] So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, 'What's going on?' Well, you're not alone.
Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.
Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.
[in the conference room] Hey Pam, can I see you for a second?  So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day.  So he generously offered to wash our car.
No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not...
Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
[As he's walking out] That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!
[whispering] Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...
Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.
Well, that is because that is the gift that keeps on giving. Oh, my God. I left today's paper on my desk.
You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
Well, I can't be the only one who didn't -- [sees mugs on Angela's and Meredith's desks]
Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?
Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.
And I was still just a paper salesman.
Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some fire crackers and they start popping]
Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.
Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.
Oh, also, while you���re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.
So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?
Oh, burn.  Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too. [they laugh]
[crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.
If you could help me out, that would be���
He���s got a bank vault. That���s a start.
I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow���s his wedding day. You can���t be anything but happy on your wedding day.
You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
Okay, bye. [Jim turns back to Julius] So sorry about that.
You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.
Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six.
It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.
And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?
I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
[Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.
Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause. [group agrees, protests]
Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
[while Dwight and Kelly are arguing] Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
So what did he say? Was it my fault?
I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh]
The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that���s final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I���m not risking that again.
Okay, it���s not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.
[front door slams, Kelly walks by] Hey, Kelly.
So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.
Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.
[slinking out of the room] Alright, you are welcome.  I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.
But that doesn���t matter. This does. It���s the only thing that matters. We���ve had some really nice days together.
Okay. I can���t say that that���s not fair.
All right, guys. It didn���t work out for any of us, so��� we���re still on the same team. Let me get these.
Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.
You're right, we didn't dance.  It was more like, swaying.  But still romantic.
Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen.
Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.
That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot.
Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!
[naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?
Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?
So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again.
[glances at Pam] Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.
Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met...
Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?
OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.
[looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled 'administrative' and 'assistant.'
So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.
No, you what, seriously, you should have it.
No, it's not 'ugh.' It is... office camaraderie.
Ah, good. Good luck. Doing good. [goes to the index cards and writes another race down]
[collects Dwight's weapons from around the office; holds up a hand scythe]
Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?
Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?
[Pam approaches as he sits in his car]  Hey.
Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can���t give 100% to two things at once you know.
Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
���Gotta go! Darth Vader's launching a huge attack.���
[whistling, places cup of coffee onto Dwight's desk] Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do.
I don't know.  Feel like... Friday night crowds...
Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!
Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I'll... I'll finish explaining the rules. Let's... let me explain it first, and then...
Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.
I don���t know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I���ve been faced with a tough decision, there���s only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.
Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.
Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?
Pam, Pam, it's time.  Let's go to the hospital.
You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.
Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
We should take a look at those surveys.
Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.
Well, yeah I don't want to see her get physically harmed, that's for sure.
[Michael playing air guitar on pool table] Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this.
If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I���this will be so huge for our family.
What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone.
Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.
Well, you seem to have this under control.
No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...
Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way?
That's weird, if it's not locked, why isn't it opening?
Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.
Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.
Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.
The one I have. I'll use the one I have.
[partially blown up balloons on table and hanging from streamers] Are you kidding?
Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam.  Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
Quick question - do you play the guitar?
[back to Pam] Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.
This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?
David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal.  While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?
Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.
Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.
That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.
Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.
Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.
Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves]
Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back.
Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone]
[in women's bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.
Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman.
I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That���s it. You look really, really good.
Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go.
It's still on a bike path though right?
Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over.
Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.
Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?
So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.
So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.
[on the phone] Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!
Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it.
Okay, I can't find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found 'em.  They're here.
Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.
But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.
That���s pretty good.  What about uh, for a thousand points?
Yeah, we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything.
Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and we're basically there.
So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.
Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that.
He brings up two good points.  Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?
Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?
You���re gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy���s gonna record it. So we���ll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?
Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit...
Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? You���re clean, right?
What award would you like to give Dwight?
[enters] Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They���re going to make you pay for the fish, and��� they wanted to know when you can start.
There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for.
Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.
When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. ��I just wanted... to go home. ��This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013. ��You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space.
I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.
In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment.
Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.
You know, that's probably not gonna last too long, you should go to a hospital and get a real cast.
A toast, better make it good.  To avoiding a class two felony charge.
Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.
I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.
Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win.
Oh, one hundred percent.  We all want to see you tattoo your ass.
Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.
Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.
I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.
Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.
Ah, gotcha.  Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.
I think I got a pretty good sense of that one.
[holds mug next to Andy's head] Make the face. [Andy smiles] Yeah, I don't see it.
I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses.
Doesn���t seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.
No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.
I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here.
I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.
Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-
You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.
Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore. [Dwight follows red cord through office past Phyllis' and Stanley's desks]
Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.
I feel like a stranger in my own country.
OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?
The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... [shrugs] Oh well.
Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.
What about music?  Do you have any music?
Yeah, I do. C'mon. [they hold hands and cross street]
Well, turns out he actually made it up there.
That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.
It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?
Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right?
[opens door to Gabe's office] All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again. [Gabe motions that he's on the phone] 'Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.
[imitating game announcer] You win. [Darryl throws empty can on floor] How good did that feel?
Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?
Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.
Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?
That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.
Wow.  Um, ok. [pops Dwight's orb with scissors]
Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?
It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.
You're only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but.
[cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.
Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.
Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping]
By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.
Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better.  I only slack off when things are good.
How many words per minute does the average person type?
The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.
They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now. [crumples up beans, stomps on them, and throws them in a box]
So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.
You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?
[to Pam] I'm so sorry for all of this.
And I took it right back. It was like...
Well, that is... because you didn't realize that... I was left-handed.
[as Andy and Kevin shout 'yeah!' in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.
[sarcastically] Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started. [starts to write on a piece of paper]
...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but...
It's, okay, it's Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.
Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.
There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!
At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision.
So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
[noticing that everyone is giving him a sympathetic look] How does everyone know already?
Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. [Jim puts a pencil into the time clock and pulls it out broken in half] We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it... [being pulled away by Pam]
And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?
Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.
[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm excited.  Oh, definitely.
Either way, Dwight��� I can���t be there for you. I���m sorry.
Pam, I���m not explaining this to you-- Pam, I���m not going over this again.
Okay. Have you ever seen the movie Sixth Sense? Maybe you are already dead.
Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.
All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.
This... is Parkour. [turns laptop to camera, shows Parkour instructional video] Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. [Michael is shown climbing/walking on various objects in office] The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.
[on phone] Please don't pick up, please don't pick up, please don't pick up.
Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.
[Michael walks in] Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets.  Do you want to-
I really heard him on that. This one's interesting I'm not really sure what he meant by this. Um, 'Dwight Schrute Privates.' Tough to say.
[wearing a tuxedo] I don't know. Is it classy enough?
There���s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor ���
Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?
Uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'Cause otherwise we can't do any work.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.
Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance.
Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies [holds up index cards] - that's just unfair.
How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.
To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.
Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.
Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.'
Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
Ok, um, this is��� [leaves DVD with her]���I���ll be right back.
Stanley. Uhh��� you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously.
Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.
[walks into his office and sees the mallard back on his desk] Dwight, you brought the mallard back.
I'm sorry.  She scares me. [walks away, Pam keeps eating]
Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try.
What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?
Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?
Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.
[sings] Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,
Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
[stammers] I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.
But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap.
Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?
Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands - including Pam]
Well, if Pam says she won���t go, then���[chuckles] we���re gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph.
Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. [Reveal Jim behind Quad-Desk] Thank you.
Chapter 2 ��� Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.
[to Michael] Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.
Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.
Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
Is that not what happens when you're high?
There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.
Well, you know you can't actually poison him.
Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?
Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday.  So, keep that goin'.
He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.
Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?
I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn���t love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid���wonderful���boring���amazing job.
Okay, this is the second time in two days that the website isn't working.  Do you guys know anything about it?
The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty.
You know what it���s not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
Prank! [throws money from Dwight���s wallet on the floor]
Okay alright. [gets up] I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.
[getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks.
I'm gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids.
No, no, no, definitely, definitely.  Yes.  Next weekend, then.  All right!  I love you, too.
Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
OK, I'm gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael's office] to do some work. So I will be in here.
Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation?
[to the buyer] Hold on a second. [to Pam] The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about���
It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.
Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over?
I have no idea.  We went right for the copier.
���Together we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh.���
Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.
Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why.
The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes!
Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.
I ain���t fraid of no ghost. [Pam holds up drawing of a hand with the middle finger raised] Whoa!
Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.
[shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.
No way. Let's do this [crumples post it and throws into mug. Misses.] Oh.
No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it.
No, no. I want to hear you tell it.
No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, 'world's longest engagement', um, we're all expecting it, you know?
I guess he can't get any girl he wants.
Check this out though, spin serve. [serves, and Dwight scores] Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...
Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.
Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.
Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...
Uh, I can't get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can't...
I don���t know. I���ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming.  But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel.  I just can't grab onto him.  It's infuriating.
I think it'll take you a little longer than that.
[to camera] Who is this guy? We are killing it.
I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?
That���s obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
[as Pam has another contraction]  Oh!  Oh, alright.  That's a good one.
When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?
[starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ...[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
Chapter seven: The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.
Okay, that's insanely complicated and the first thing I'm going to do is erase it.
I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.
No, see? Right there, that���s the problem with your method. ���Cause I still don���t know if you���re saying ���Sea World��� or ���see the world,��� and it���s taking a lot of time to explain it.
If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...
Hey it's me. So uh, don't worry. Everything's ok.
Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in��� March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so��� [sits on floor]
Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.
Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
No, it's not, because you don't really work here.
Take care of my wife. I will be back.
Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.
[on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.
Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind.
If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.
Ok. Well, hey, you're not here. You don't know, Ok? It's intense. They made me eat black licorice.
Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?
I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.
There���s actually not a rule that says that.
Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.
Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.
You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.
Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um��� I don���t know how to tell you this, but��� we have a little bit of a problem.
Is this real? [Pam dumps Michael's screenplay on Jim's desk]
Yeah. Big sale. Don���t worry about it though, I don���t really care about the points.  I would like a point receipt though���[on phone] Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald���can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. [gets up to give Erin his point receipt]
Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?
Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that.
It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.
[conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.
Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?
Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don't. Riveting.
Toby? Mm hmm. [looks back to Michael] I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
[ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?
It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.
Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it.
All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-
But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.
[to Michael] It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just - [blows air] - all in.
Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office]
Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
You know, I just think you should know that-
Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me���[gets interrupted by Andy].
Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
[clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up]
[reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters.
Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1:15.
I haven���t heard of it, obviously. But I���m out because I am significantly younger than you-
Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?
That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
No, No, we'll just board that up.  It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.
Listen, this isn't a favor, all right?  This is a good idea. We all win.
Okay, guys, guys, guys. That almost sounded like business, and we are trying to focus here today, okay?
Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.
Yeah, definitely didn't need help with that, but, yeah.
Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.
I've always gotten along well with Toby.  Uh, we're friends.  But I don't think we'll stay in touch necessarily.  I think I'll probably get updates on him from Pam.
You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok?
And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.
All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]
Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham! [mimes punch] Gotta go through me first.
You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.
Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.
Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90.
No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?
Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down.
I���m doing this just for me? Is that what I���m doing? I���m doing it just for me. If that���s what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?
Maybe we should just wait and find out.
[Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.
Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-
I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!
Psst. You think this thing's gonna go much longer?
That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?
OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.
You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.
Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.
Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.
My god, I���m so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.
Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.
Oh do you mean when I get the job?
[grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.
You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.
OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?
I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill.
To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?
Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
[walking to his car] Hey, it's me.  It is 5:03.
I don���t even know where the stairs are!
Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right?
And in this room here, if you look closely, you will find out a few clues about who lives here.  Um, he likes biking, obviously, and uh, what else?  Uh, he likes tour guides, I guess.  And if you're very perceptive, you'll notice that he didn't do a great job of cleaning his room [kicks water bottle under bed].  Ok, and uh, that's the tou-
Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.
Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned.
We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an 'Andy for Manager?' pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.
Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted.
Right in the sweet spot. I think you���re gonna be really happy.
And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.
You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?
You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.
Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.
Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...
[addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you.
Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?
[Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.
So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends.
Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I���m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don���t worry, he���s the best in the biz.
Not really a question. [starts to laugh] Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk.
Dwight. This, [picks up balloon] fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?
Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. [laughs] Oh, text message from my brother. 'Pam cool. Welcome to the family.'
I would love to hear the other mottos.
I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.
Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that.
Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.
I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.
Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?
You know, at the end of the day, it���s really only two days. I mean, I���ll be back in the office. ��If you need me for an emergency, call me. ��I���ll be there...
Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.
We got to see Ping.  [Pam nods] And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. [Pam nods] Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. [Pam nods] Which for me, has ruined them for life. [looks at Pam, who is staring at him, nodding]
I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that's not happening, I'm not averse to just buying them all off.
Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.
Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley's face]
Hey, Abby. I wanted to give you this for all your hard work today. Look. Michael signed it and everything. Official.
Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?
[listening to and editing Jo's book on tape]
[Creed takes toy from toy drive box.] Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy
Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
I'm gonna help you through it all right?
I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.
[dictating to Pam] Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
[hushed voice] Uh yeah. Trust me, I���d rather be with you guys.
Oh my God!  Wait, this goes back two years.
[Michael steals the ball] Yeah, Michael. Go Michael. [makes shot]
[pumps fist] ...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.
Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical.
Yeah, I didn't think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.
This is actually a big potential sale, so...
Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.
So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.
Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.
Getting my wife a week off from work.
[ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what?
Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?
Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out?
I don't really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.
Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.
Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then... [reading text message] 'How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight.'
[speaking into the mallard and looking a Dwight] Hi buddy.
But there is a reason why I'm here!
Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?
I���m sure you did not. What was your question?
Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay?
It's Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that.
What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?
Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so...
Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?
What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.
You know what you should do? Take a vacation.
Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...
[to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay. [runs]
Okay, you know what?  I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  He'd probably know...
Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
Yeah, I'm aware of that.  But he's also being super annoying.  And I'm not a perfect person.
Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...
Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.
This, man. I can���t do this to Pam.
For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.
Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?
So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.
Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?
Six point five days. [winces as Kevin smacks him on the back]
I saw the movie. I just don't know every line from the film.
So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back.
Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.
Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.
What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?
God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]
Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one.
Pam and I are good buddies.  I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.
Another bullets heads towards Agent Michael Scarn, but he jumps out of the plane without a parachute.
[on phone] I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
No- Ok. Well, we'll talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?
We���ll see. You are an assistant who���s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.
I���m taking some time off from work���well, my other work���because we needed it.
[to Eric] You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
[Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you're going up there?
New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?
Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
[Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing?
Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by]
Here we go. [Meredith's phone rings. Jim and Andy groan.]
Cool. Thanks. [puts his hat on Erin's head]
Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.
Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go. [hands her an envelope with money in it]
Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it.[Pam laughs] OK, good luck!
Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. [pulls up Dwight's game] Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.
Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  I'm glad.  Any real potential there Beesley?
It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ...
[on cell phone] Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.
Hey, come on.  Let's go to the hospital.
It's still happening right now actually, so uh...
Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.
We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.
Let's be honest, it's not totally my fault. [indicates Pam]  Shared responsibility.
Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.
Oh.  He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.
What's that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don't, because I've got my eye on you.
[Jim and Pam approaching the wedding venue] Is this his house?
Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don't know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.
I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- [pulls out a pie chart] How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.
Okay, so what do you want to do?
Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.
I have no idea where we���re gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.
[overhears loud monster noises] Its Monster dot com.  Singular.
You know he's doing all this on purpose.
No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?
[on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]
Oh, I didn���t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.
Those are the books that sum up the other books.
Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.
Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?
Hello? [laughs] No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK. [punches button on phone]
Yeah, you don't have to, ummm.  Alright, yes, that's not gonna be awkward at all.
Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
All right, what the heck? Let's do it.
[in unison] I do not think that is funny.
Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head]
Michael, we only told our parents last week.
[on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.
Oh, it���s happening!  Let���s just keep it between you and me for right now.
All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this.
Yes, he did.  You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.
I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD.
[In the parking lot, holding his side, walking to the taxi, Pam follows] Oh...what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. [To taxi driver] One second. Oh...
Nah, you definitely weren���t kidding.  And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. [hands Andy slip of paper]
I can't.  She's too strong.  She's, careful, though.  You don't want to break it.
Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?
Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly.
And then you go to school for three years.
Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy.
[looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off]
And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.
Hey, man. It���s halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don���t. I���m in. Yeah, yep, I���m all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. [hangs up] Yeah!
It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-
I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks?
Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
This is hilarious, but we���re gonna stop with all--
That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it's a murder.
Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.
Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I'm not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley's tie is really the story of the day...
Hey, you know what? I got you a cake.
And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
Hey! [Runs after her and looks into her eyes] I... [hugs her tightly, Pam doesn't hug back]
You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.
That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.
Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... [Pam starts laughing]... spy on our other branch. No no no.
So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.
Ah.  That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them.
Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo���s here. Let���s do this. Change if you need to.
Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires.
And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--
[Pam starts sipping an empty glass] I think those might be empty.
Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
What? [Karen's player shoots Jim's player, 'You killed Jim Halpert' appears on the screen, Karen giggles]
Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...
Do we all have our copy of 'Threat Level: Midnight', by Michael Scott?
Well it���s not that easy. It���s kind of sometimes difficult.
The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs]
Well, maybe you should get back to work.
[on phone] Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. [to office co-workers] Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out. [lowers voice] He said it should just be under an hour, so... [everyone groans] we did it.
Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.
I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.
Okay, I'll just go get the other guy.
Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.
Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.
Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? [Karen smiles and gives herself away] Wow. Ok. You got me.
Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.
Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.
The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.
I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...
The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.
Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
Sorry, man, I can���t focus on zingers. There���s too many potential clients.
Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
I���m on the phone. I���m on the phone.
Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.
[to babysitter] So... how do you guys know each other?
Where do you want to go for dinner?
Oh, Clark. I���m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.
I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...
I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy.
It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or...
Andy ��� this whole idea of our situation being just like war?  It���s just not true.  We just work at a paper company.  And you���re our regional manager.  And guess what man?  You don���t have to prove anything.  We like you as regional manager.  Andy if you don���t believe me take a look at what���s on my head.  I���m wearing a very pink hat.  I���ve been getting weird looks all day because I���m pretty sure ���DM does GB��� means something kinda sexual.  But guess who���s wearing them?  All of us.  Just for you man.  That���s huge.
You know, truth be told, I think all you���ll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I���m gone.
Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.
Just give me one second. I'm just gonna grab something to eat.
Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?
Well it���s sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.
DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island?  Yes! Meredith?
I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So���my pitch is���me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.
OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use [finds a mug] uh, oh -- Snoopy.
OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.
Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad.
I need you to breathe in my face right now.
[on the phone] Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.
Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.
Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises.
Dwight and I are both writing letters to our clients. I'm just sending a quick note to say how much I appreciate their business, and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation. It's just... different styles.
Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.
Just cut through it, man, it's no big deal.
I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.
The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.
I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?
Oh, hello Mater. Good news: I've married. Tell Fater. [hangs up] Such a nice woman.
Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
Now, wait a minute.  You're not gonna punch a wall, or me, or anything like that if you don't win the point, are you?
Oh, um. [pulls item from bag and hands to Pam] Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it.
Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.
Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.
Yes, it is harassment and I'm going to be suing the winking face. I've hired the angry face as my lawyer and you will be hearing from him pretty soon.
Oh, tomorrow, that's gonna be tough 'cause I already laid out my outfit, so...
Oh. Adorable, right? [opens kiddie bathroom, sees man on toilet] I walked in on someone in the bathroom.
It's my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello?  Well that's great. [hangs up phone]  Turns out the paper was there all along.
Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.
Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here.
Um, thank you, Ryan, uh, I don't know, I think I made the mistake one day of telling someone that I like penguins, and here we are.
Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos.
[sighs] I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.
I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...
Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.
Animation? All her by the way. [points at Pam]
I won't.  But, you will wash and buff our car.
Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it.
And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.
It���s insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I���m stuck here trying to keep him on board.
[touches headset] Call you right back. What were you saying?
Michael, can I talk to you in your office?
Well, it could happen. Have you ever seen the movie Outbreak?
It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date.
I don���t know how else to tell you, okay? I���m doing everything I can every week to bring home something...
Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.
I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really...
I don't think we have to do this again cause it's gonna take a whole. [everyone clinks glasses]
What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
Okay. All right, come on. [picks up Cece from Pam, whispers to her] Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip.
Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these.
Nope.  Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office]
Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input���
[Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
[holding up a sign that reads, 'Dwight picked the wrong day to put a wooden mallard in my office']
I am not kidding. [shows camera an engagement ring] Got it a week after we started dating.
Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.
What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life.
No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]
I think you should do it. That's great!
You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.
Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more.
Okay. I���m really sorry I told the guys I���d be there for the board meeting.
[Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.
What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing.
The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California��� for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.�� He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don���t really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.���� And he chose���
Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away 'Survival Skills' and 'Self-defense.'
[playing Call of Duty] Oh? Someone's left out in the open, taking a little siesta. Not smart. [shoots] Yes! Finally killed you... [Karen's desk is empty]
OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?
How far away did you think we were?
What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!
[reading from computer] ���Side effects of EMF include: headaches...���
Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?
Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.
Well there is some bad news.  [accent] There has been another murder.
And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear.
[Pam starts nodding in agreement] Why are you nodding?
Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry.
No. Okay. Um, I���ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
Is that... I didn't know that was your... okay, so we're in agreement, this is not ideal... situation.
Sure.  Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-
Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.
Story's kinda bland.  It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.
It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven.
[Turns off Dwight's music] Whether it's this time or next time.
So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret.
That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?
Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.
Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.
And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.
I can always kind of win at roulette.
Well we all want a good party, right?
Well, then I guess you���re ready for this. [gives her the Christmas card]
Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit.
One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so... [imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles, Michael comes over by Jim laughing]
Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.
Oh, Pam? Can I see you in here for a second? It's important, so...
Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her.
I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.
Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.
You pet the animals and they pet you back.
[demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.
Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally.
[on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled?
Oh, great. So we���ll see somebody else���s kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it���s really not that hard to film a video.
OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
[sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.
Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?
When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?
Okay. But what is he more famous for?
[ahem] You can... [slightly effeminate] You can do it Ryan.
Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-
That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.
I don't know how we'd go about doing that.
But you said that you went out with her this weekend.
This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
[aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever.
Oh good, so we don't have to work.
Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn.
Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...
[walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] 'Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.' [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!
I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?
[laughing] She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.
[on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.
Okay, you could just say you don't know what's going on.
Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.
Pam, I couldn���t get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.
You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
I promise you, you don���t have to do this for me.
Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He���s putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I���ve done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight���only good surprises. ���Guten Pranken���. [chuckles]
You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
One second 'cause that sounds really good. Is jackass one word or two? [Dwight sighs] One, right? 'Cause, 'cause of the show, it's one.
Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?
Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?
[A note is on Jim's computer that says, 'It is time. Parking lot at noon.' Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]
I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.
When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.
Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork.
Great. [to a group of guests]  Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] ...no.
Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You're way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.
Or a high school girl. Let's go [mouths 'wow' to the camera].
It's not--- It's not about me.  I mean, this your dream.
Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again. [Pam rolls her eyes and walks away]
Um, this one interesting the power comes from the font in this one. 'Schrute Space,' very medieval, very England. Um, this one's forceful, this one's very Dwight. 'Quiet! Dwight Schrute Working,' it's good.
Okay, what was this look? [Oscar does the look.]
That's actually a good idea.  We'll all take a brief intermission. [To Pam]  Hey, are you hungry?
Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them.
So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.
Oh man, that's crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.
Oh, Somebody went in. That was a team effort, Pam.
He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.
OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.
Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.
That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?
Oh, I just mean if you, if you didn't lock the door, then we could be upstairs where it's warmer.
Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works.
Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?
You know what?  I'm just going to call a cab from here.
OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-
[after tense pause] OK. Here ya go. [roughly hands Darryl his thermos]
Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish?
Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.
Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.
[leaning against Creed's desk] So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party.
Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.
[mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?
Anything. [Dwight begins to fill his new purse] Good. Yup.
You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.
You see that?  I'm pretty sure she's...  Hi.
Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don���t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now.  Totally.
Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.
Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.
I don't know. Hey, have you seen my baby?
Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think...
You didn't hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh.
[shoe falls while climbing ladder] Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. [grunts] Creed. I was never here, all right?
[gets up to leave room, Michael gestures for him to stay]
Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
[Michael give Jim a 'World's Best Boss' mug] Thank you.
For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin���
Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults.
Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. [Pam nods reluctantly]  And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date.
Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
[hands Pam Andy's phone] Are there any messages?
And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]
Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?
Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?
Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you...
That���s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
Why wouldn't you see him?  You work for him.
[Opens folder and reads from Dwight's file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright! [knocks on side of truck]
Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while.
I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. [holds up same book] I've only sold one copy.
And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand. [Michael, then Dwight raises hand]  Can I get you some punch?
That's a good one. [a red sports car drives up] Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?
Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.
Good one? [Toby puts on the lens cover and scurries away awkwardly] That's a cool camera.
You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.
Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.
Uh, can you get this rundown for me?' [impersonating Charles]
Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?
And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.
Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe.
Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-
Well, Andy has a mug just like that.
[Jim and Dwight sitting next to each other in talking head interview] Go ahead.
What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?
Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything?
Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.
[bounces ball off wall with Toby] So that's what this sound is all day.
Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing.
So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?
College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.
Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?
Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?
This... is the future, because... This is the past. I���ve been through a lot of issues in my life. I���ve seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I���ve been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause]
[peering nervously through conference room window] Oh, I don't have anything to say. I'm just hiding from Dwight.
And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.  [everyone claps and makes comments]
Oh, I actually talked to my wife and we���d really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor.
Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk.
Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question.
Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
You should actually thank Erin, she's the one who agreed to babysit.
And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.
Oh!  See I'm here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case���let���s get to work.
They weren���t really talking that much about money. They just said, We���re good with investing and then I...and I...
Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.
Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?
I'll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!
I think I left my wallet in your house.
Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.
I don't know because I everything I own is there.
Huh. Well, you know, you can���t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what���s most important. That���s my new thing.
Now, this is the projection over three months?
Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything.
It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.
[laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
Alright, well, we're never leaving the house again.
Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.
Hey it���s Jim Halpert.  I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight.  Because I���ve read a lot about this really great documentary.
Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.
Thank you. You know what, screw this! [pulls Pam into a big smooch]
Okay. I���ll see you in a little bit.
Dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level. And he apparently has a girlfriend, so... I guess there really is someone for everybody.
We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It���s like everything I did, he just wouldn���t go for it.
Andy, can I talk to you for a second?
[grunts] Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?
Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.
You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
Good eye - it's an oval.  [Andy compares his arm length to his side of the conference table] You're measuring the table.
What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.
Well, the group tour is now leaving, then.  Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows.  I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.
Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
I may have told some people that.  I'm nervous.  I'm about to get married.
I was blue group, so it was second from the top.
Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.
Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands]
Yep.  Yeah.  She's blind, is that a problem?
Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago.
Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.
I am gonna need your advice [starts playing loud opera music, everyone can hear it, Creed starts crying] I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think?
How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.
[Jim and Pam are walking outside] I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.
Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.
Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or...
Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, [starts snapping] you're a Jet all the way, right?
Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?
Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?
I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --
Only if you tell me what you're writing.
Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.
[shakes Michael's hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
[in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff.
Thank you, sir. [Tips his glass to Daryl]
No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this.
Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.
Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, let's go to the hospital.  Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.
No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?
If this job is in a well, I don't want it.
Ahem. This is for you... and [puts blanket around her shoulders] ...Happy Birthday, Kel.
I mean, do you like it? You having fun? [Andy snorts, unsure how to answer] Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun���.and you did that.
Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go.
[phone] Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.
That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.
Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
Yeah, I never even knew that part of the office existed. [Pam chuckles] Hey, who's that guy? [Jim points to Stanley]
I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?
Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.
OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad.
I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.
You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
You should ask him. It���s a color you would never expect. [Dwight storms off] Too easy.
Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]
We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man.
We were just kids.  What did we know?
Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don���t worry. I���ll figure it out.
Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
[drawing two family trees on a whiteboard] Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through [draws a question mark] delusion.
But that would make more sense. [Pam sighs]
Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.
We bonded. We got to- [Dwight starts dropping into the bus on top of Jim]
The next year he really stepped things up.
The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it.
Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.
I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.
Party looks fun doesn���t it?  Everybody seems to be in there having a great time.  So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.
Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]
You���re not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I���m in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You���ve agreed to this.
How much time do you have left on your break?
I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. [behind Jim, Dwight climbs telephone pole] Oh he'll be fine. I made it up there.
[Gets up and looks out Nellie���s office window] He���s running!
No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.
Hey. It���s nothing. Alright? I���ll text you when we get there. Let you know what���s going on.
So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.
Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things.
[On phone in hallway] No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.
It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.
I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.
Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.
Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.
Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who���s gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.
OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...
Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you���d ever set foot in in this town?
Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.
He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash.
I forgot if there was an 'e' between the 'l' and the 'y.' I still don't know.
Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.
So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume.  And a moustache.
Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?
Good!  Fine!  I've got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee... [dialing phone]
Hey! There she is. [Pam laughs] How you doin?
Am I the only one that���s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
Michael, look I'll just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.
Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.
You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.
And then an older gentleman asked you 'Boxers or briefs?'
Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.
Yeah.  [Jim leans in for a kiss but Pam turns away]  She's fine.
[Jim moves his head closer and Pam taps him gently in the face] Oh, ok.
What are you talking about? You're not the boss. Andy is. Andy?
So beautiful. [Pam's starts to cry.  Jim pulls up chair to sit next to her] Hey--
That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?
I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise. [taps Bluetooth earpiece] Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.
���Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you.���
I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working.
And I found out that there's a bus at 5:00 a.m.
You know, it's getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.
Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? [points at self] This guy!
I don���t know. He wasn���t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn���t hire his wife.
Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.
Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!
I liked you better when you were the temp.
No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.
[goofy voice] Frank and Beans. [laughs] Always makes her laugh.
Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman.
I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.
You���re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.
They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-
Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
No. [Michael gets up and walks into his office]
[singing the intro to The Lion King's 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight'] A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?
[trying to hide from Michael what they're doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]
I didn't say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.
Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?
Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.
I'm gonna write you up for not working.
I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope]
But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.
[presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]
I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.
Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
Post-it Notes. Wow, that purse holds a lot.
Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'.
That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
Travel.  I've been looking forward to it.  It's gonna be... really nice.  Gonna find myself.
All depends on the conference room meeting itself. [phone chimes] Uh, okay.
I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.
Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
What? Yes, that is exactly what I mean. Wow. You are very good at what you do.
You will never want to leave your room.
You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?
We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.
All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
[Reading Pam's palm, while she has on extremely padded gloves] Wow, that is really interesting.
[waiting outside the bathroom for Pam, he is holding a hand-picked bouquet of flowers and pacing] These are for you.
Alright. Let's clear this up. [on phone] Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?
What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.
[cell phone rings] Excuse me, one second. Hi.
Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?
Eh, she's nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
[reading screenplay] Bullets are flying everywhere.  Ooo, wait, last page, big finish.  Here we go. Agent Michael Scarn kicks open the plane door with a karate chop.
I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.
Dwight, come on. Don���t end on a bad note.
Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-
I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.
Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.
Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he���s gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--
Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open.
Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] 'The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert.' Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.
I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.
Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?
Wow. And just out of curiosity, how much is it?
[mimicking Stanley] I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
[looks bored. Taps finger on desk. Head falls to desk]
Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so...
Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.
Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.
Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
I wasn't. But thank you. [to Pam] Do you know anything about this party?
Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...
Love you too. [hangs up phone, Pam sits on a bench crying]
Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear.
Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.
[on phone] Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background]
The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.
How embarrassing is it? That's not fair. Here...
[snaps back] No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand. [half of office raises hand] Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand. [other half of office raises hand]
[not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [sic] energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  [David laughs] So that's a... bonus.
Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that. [Dwight smiles at Jim] Really? Smirking?
This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.
Yes! Phyllis! [claps] Phyllis, just put your foot right through here [lifts strap on box of paper]. Right through the flonk.
Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.
Well, I think you handled it pretty well.
How long is this? [flips through pages]  Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings.
I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?
All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player.
Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.
I'm pretty excited about today. I baby-sit Toby's daughter Sasha sometimes. So, she's the coolest kid. She has seen me play with dolls, though, so I don't know how cool she thinks I am.
Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'.
Good advice Beesley.  Thanks.  See you out there.
We need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?
Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?
Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?
[Jim's phone goes to voicemail] This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.
No. I just missed my wife.[Gives Pam a hug and a kiss]
Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
Ok, we didn't dance.  I was totally joking anyway.  I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance.  Right?
Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.
Let's go driver! [clapping] Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...
Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage...
Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
Yeah, no one can snap with their little finger.
[closes folder] You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?
Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.
And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.
Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the... [Jim bites his lip again and pounds on table]
Alright, then I will catch you later��� What do we do now?
It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?
Well, I should hope so. [Michael takes phone] Who is this?
No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I���m gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.
[to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know.
[sings Olympic theme song] This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.
Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?
You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer.
Well that's great.  [shakes Ryan's hand] You're talking about your court ordered community service?
I just didn't, you know, want a deal.
Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.
You good?  I'm just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...
In Philly, so, that doesn���t really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.
Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?
Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?
Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into?
Nice.  That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.
[picks a card] It's the four of hearts.
[yawning] What about an energy drink or something?
Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?
She's, um, she's in New York. She's at an art school.
Karen and I are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time. I don't know what to tell you. Right now? Dead heat.
Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in 'Shagadelic, baby,' at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
[to Dwight] All right. So... I guess this is it.
Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..
Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?
Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?
Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.
Not important.  Because you're not dating her.  Because it's a felony.
Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
[at company picnic] All right, you ready for this?
Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?
Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.
I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me.
Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on. [to everyone] Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. [to Katy] Desert Island. Five movies. Go.
She looks at it when she���s on the potty, and she makes the faces.
I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.
My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with.'
Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?
You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing���none of these people are good enough.
I don't know what else we can do here.
I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.
Hey! Can I talk you? For a second?
Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.
Yeah, who'd have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up; smiles]
Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal. [in voiceover] I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.
Go bag's in the car...  Keys, my keys, where's my keys?
Actually, I have the certification number right here.
Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen.
You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?
[to Jordan] Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.
Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over.
And you went to New York to do this.  So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?
[telephone ringing] [shows note to camera 'It's OK. She'll call back!']
I don���t know, for such a crazy number I���d like something pretty crazy.
Do you really have to do that right now?
No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is: really sorry.
I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?
Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.
There is no inner circle.  Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.
Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we���re scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix ��� me asking the boss of the company I���m abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash.  So��� problem solved. Thanks, guys.
Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.
Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.
No, don't worry about it.  We'll just got double or nothin'.
Okay, the limo���s gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready ���cause I want to pack in a lot.
Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, 'For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?' and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.
Pam!  You don't think he'll mind if we take the shampoo, do you? [holds up large bottle]
[laughs] You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office]
[after Pam has another contraction]  That's seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.
Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.
Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!
Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter.
Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?
Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. [Windows reboot sound] Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?
Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?
Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.
[on phone, leaving a message] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. [hangs up and exhales sharply]
Let���s not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you���re expecting a fax today, please don���t yell out, ���Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.��� Ok? That���s nonsense.
Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes.  Tadah!
Yeah, was it 10? Yeah, I have it on a mix tape from junior high.
I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.
No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so...
Okay. Let's start with the 'I love you' level.
[on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, 'just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.'
[sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome.
Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.
Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.
Customers have to use the coupon code from the website.  And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.
Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It���s really great.
I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.
Sure, yeah. [laughs] Hollywood. [Ryan Howard pulls out 3 thick scripts] Alright.
No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn���t know. Um��� actually I did tell Pam and we decided ���no���. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I���m thinking there���s another conversation coming. And, it���s hard to know when that will be.
No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.
Gettin��� a lot of mileage out of this, aren���t ya?
Okay.  Sshh.  I know.  [hands the baby to Pam]
Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
Then you did nothing wrong. We should go.
Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.
Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I���m gone.
No, I did that before, it added nothing.
My charity is the Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's Department, because Dwight's a Volunteer Sheriff. So I thought this was a perfect opportunity to support/mock him.
See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.  It's-
Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?
It's Mose. Who do you think it is?
[after entering daycare] Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.
Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you [in a more and more seductive voice] and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? [Kevin gets up to join the 'hot' team to their great joy] Does that end the debate?
That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
I missed you. [they embrace and kiss as Andy watches on sadly]
Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you!
But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.
[laughs] I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um... [nods]
Oh, it���s the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela���s been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.
Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him.  And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.
Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.
Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]
Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...that's it. That's really all we were looking for.
Okay. The annex it is. I���ll be sitting at your desk if that���s okay with you.
Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch.
What is that? [looks at sign that says 'IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.'] It is your birthday period.
Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?
I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves.
I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.
Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one [holds up paper]. Originally given by Benito Mussolini.
Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away]
It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.
Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.
The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.
Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just��� we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.
I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.
Don't. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!
I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.
We'll see.  I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.
[a text tone goes off] Is that my phone?
How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran.
Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
Hey, so this isn���t matching up with this���and I���m not sure which one���s right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?
Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?
Look, Pam, I don���t know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It���s gone. That moment���s just gone. I missed it.
[to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.
Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.
Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second.
[quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.
Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.
Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?
Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you���re not the best with the phone.
I looked at you coming around, and I said, ���Wintergreen.���
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.
Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?
Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.
I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why.  Interesting.
Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?
Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...
Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?
Well... yes, that's probably what it is.  So what do I do?
You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.
You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, I'll just be in, you know. [closes door behind him to supply closet]
Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.
- two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.
Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.
Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical.
So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.
Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
[grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second?
I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.
This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.
It���s Ryan. ���I���m sorry. I lied. I���m not in the bathroom. I can���t do it. I need to see my mom. I���m going home.���
Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... [Ryan walks in]
Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?
Nah, I think it's mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.
Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.
Are you really gonna marry him?  [Pam nods] ...Ok.
Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.
Call me when you get in. [kisses Pam]
Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.
Okay, DVDs. Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Toby, go ahead.
I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?
Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.
[walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?
Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people...
Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]
Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim. [shakes head] I got nothin'.
Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim.
Oh, okay. Oh, do... that's what the tape is for. I didn't know.
I'm sorry. This is for a news audition?
Oh no, no, no. That's ok. [Jim shoves some snacks in his pocket as he gets out of limo] Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center?
No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.
Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.
Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try.
What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?
Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?
Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?
No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.
Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
You cut more than you had to, didn't you?
Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.
Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
So how does it work? It���s like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or���
[driving] I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should. [sighs]
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just...
[as Dwight tries to take paper out from under him] Hey, can you not?
We tried to find the fairest way to do it.
Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
We should help him out. [Jim and Pam each take a French fry, eat it, and then look toward the bathroom]
You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager.
All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...
Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
That'd be great, thank you. [Erin throws package, it hits Kathy. She thinks it was Jim who threw it]
No, I mean, great detective work.  'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?
I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.
Uh, by the way. Have you heard Dwight say the word immunity, yet? Because if I can get Dwight to say the word immunity, it might be the greatest day of my life.
Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight.
Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...
It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.
Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.
[brings Michael into his office] So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money.
You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.
No, nope. What else? What else? You watch The Hills? What is Heidi thinking?
Dwight, you wrote that memo. Okay, it's not an official memo.
So, how was the resort?  Did you ski a lot?
I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates...
[leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen]
Chapter 9 ��� The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.
I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.
I don't know. Is it what you expected?
Well, I promise you that has nothing to do with it.
You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?
He's just mad that we're all having fun.
[on voicemail] Hey, it's Jim.  Leave a message.
Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna���
I���m sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment.
Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that���s only gonna make things worse.
Dwight. Dwight. [Dwight's car comes screeching into view]
Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.
Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?
Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.
I'm excited, I've actually never been to Gettysburg. Uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so I freaked out and we turned the car around. But I'm older now, I can outrun a zombie.
I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
I'm sorry, wait, so is the question 'How'd I get to be so awesome?' [laughs] Because, I don't have an answer for you. [laughs]
Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
I've had a Foreman grill for about six years, I've done about 85% of my cooking on it, but I've never burnt myself, probably because I don't use it as a pillow.
Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?
Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.
Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings.  Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.
Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten...
Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.
Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5:00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes.
[swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine?
Honestly, I don't mind. [long, awkward pause until thermos is empty] Did you want me to wash it for you or...
So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer]
So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning.
Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.
Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else.
Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --
I bought it.  It's ours.  Let's go inside, I'll show you inside.  [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor.  Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet.  Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall]  Yeah, I am really sorry about this.  I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there.  Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.  [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so... [shuts the door]
Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. True���[touches his nose] Oh no.
[Philip is crying] I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?
Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write?
I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?
Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker.
Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?
Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.
Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.
Ah, ah, ah. Where's the 'please'? We're not animals.
That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] 'Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.'
[blows a raspberry, Erin looks shocked, Kevin chuckles]
Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?
You making this up as you go along, aren't you?
Today.  Now, maybe.  'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.
Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.
Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?
Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.
[Carol walks through door looking upset] [waves] Carol.
Hey, uh, does Mr. Nortman still teach here? He's a jerk, right?
God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.
No, I hear what you���re saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?
Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole 'Woody came to life' thing so quickly?
Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.
And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says 'No, Jim, here's a way.'
All right, you know what? [picks Pam up and carries her off the court] Let's do this.
And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.
[on the phone]I can have it to you by the beginning of next week.  Alright? Thanks very much. [hangs up] Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?
Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool.
Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.
Alright, let's get this started.  I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.
Yeah, right. I mean, unless they���re willing to pass some tests.
What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!
Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies.'
Guys, what is going on?!  [Pete and Tom burst out in laughter]
I... why don't we go back to this animation.
And I don't support her choice to hit you.
[to Pam] ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good.
Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.
Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about? [Michael leaves]
[Jan enters the office, pushing a stroller] Jan.
Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.
I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.
I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]
Really?  Do you wanna get back to that?  I could go.  I should go.
I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?
Mm, hey driver. Why don���t you take us to 3030 Adams?
